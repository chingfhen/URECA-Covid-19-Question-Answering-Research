# URECA-CovidQA-Research
This repository is about my URECA research. Essentially, I built a Covid-19 Question Answering System. Covid-19 rules and regulations in Singapore are continually being adapted to the severity of the viral situation. These rules and regulations come in the form of unstructured text and are very extensive. It is crucial for this information to be easily accessible and adhered to by the public. Thus, in this study, we also built a question answering system that answers covid-19 questions relating to these rules and regulations. 

I also compared the performances of 7 BERT architectures namely albert-base-v1, bert-base-cased, bert-base-uncased, distilbert-base-uncased, distilroberta-base, google/electra-base-discriminator, roberta-base. 

For an an overview, you may look at my research paper under the name, Covid-19 Question Answering System FIN.
