# URECA-CovidQA-Research

In this project, I:
 •  Developed a question answering system answers Covid-19 related questions with high accuracy
 •  Trained and fine-tuned multiple Transformer models and optimized their performances 
 •  Performed data collection by scraping websites that contain information related to Covid-19
 •  Performed manual data annotation to construct a question answering dataset

This project was part of the **NTU URECA Research Programm**e where i achieved **Merit**.

Additional notes:

The motivation for this project was to make it easier for Singaporeans to find out relevant information about Covid-19 measures. During the covid-19 pandemic in Singapore, there were a lot of Covid-19 measures that were introduced, so much so that it was difficult to keep track and find relevant information. I developed this question answering system that can extract the answers spans to user's queries. The system architecture I utilized was the retriever-reader architecture - the retriever retrieves the most relevant candidate documents, then the reader extracts the best answer span from these documents.
