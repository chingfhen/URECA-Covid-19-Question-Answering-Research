       "[{'text': 'Requirements for Safe Management Measures at the workplace Read the sector-specific guidelines and infographic on Safe Management Measures at the workplace. From 16 May 2021 to 13 June 2021, the Safe Management Measures for the workplace will be tightened. Previously, up to 50% of employees28 who are able to work from home could be at the workplace at any time. Now, employers must ensure that all employees who are able to work from home do so. Social gatherings at the workplace are disallowed. These measures help lower transmission risks by reducing the levels of interaction at common spaces at or near the workplace, and in public places, including public transport. Issued on 9 May 2020 Updated as of 14 May 2021 The tripartite partners (MOM, SNEF, and NTUC) have updated the workplace safe management measures to allow greater flexibility for businesses, while mitigating the risk of widespread COVID-19 transmission. Effective implementation of these measures will help to avoid having to impose tighter measures. These requirements are meant for general workplace settings. Specific workplaces like construction worksites and shipyards may have to fulfil additional requirements and should refer to sector-specific requirements1. Agencies including MOM, Building and Construction Authority (BCA) and Enterprise Singapore (ESG) will continue to enforce safe management measures and take action against errant employers. This may include issuing stop-work orders and financial penalties. Safe Management Measures To ensure COVID-safe workplaces, employers should take care of: Your workers; Your workplaces; and Those who may become unwell at your workplaces. A. Take care of your workers Provide employees options to work from home. From 16 May 2021 to 13 June 2021, employers must exercise heightened vigilance at the workplace. Employers must ensure that all employees who are able to work from home do so. Employers are encouraged to support as many employees in working from home as possible. This will help to limit the number of employees exposed at the workplace at any point in time, and reduce crowding in common areas, e.g. pantries, toilets, lifts. Having more employees work from home will also help sustain business operations should a case emerge at the workplace. Work-from-home measures should enable employees to maintain work-life harmony while continuing to meet business needs. The Tripartite Advisory on mental well-being at workplaces sets out practical guidance on measures that employers can adopt to support their employees’ mental well-being under a variety of work arrangements. For employees who are still unable to work from home, employers should review work processes, provide the necessary IT equipment to employees and adopt solutions that enable remote working and online collaboration. Employers are encouraged to leverage technology2 to ensure business continuity and safe management. Companies should continue to conduct virtual meetings as far as possible. Companies should pay special attention to vulnerable employees3 (e.g. persons who are aged 60 and above, and patients who are immunocompromised4 or have concurrent medical conditions). Employers are encouraged to enable these employees to work-from-home, allow them to travel to/from work at off-peak timings, temporarily redeploy them to another role within the company, or take other appropriate measures to reduce their exposure to infection risk. For employees at the workplace, employers must ensure the following precautions are in place: Stagger start times and allow flexible workplace hours5: This will spread out staff across time and place, and reduces possible congregation of employees at common spaces at or near the workplace, such as entrances, exits, lobbies, canteens, pantries. It also reduces congestion of people in public places, including public transport. Employers are encouraged to stagger the start times for all employees such that at least half of all employees arrive at the workplace at or after 10am, as far as possible. If physical meetings are needed, they can be scheduled after 10 am. These measures would enable more employees to avoid peak-hour travel, especially if employees require the use of public transport. Timings of lunch and other breaks should also be staggered accordingly. If it is not feasible to implement staggered start times, flexible workplace hours, and staggered break hours due to operational reasons (e.g. manufacturing production line activities), employers must implement other systemic arrangements to reduce congregation of employees at common spaces6. No cross-deployment across worksites7: No employee should work at more than one worksite. If cross-deployment cannot be avoided (e.g. due to the nature of the job), additional safeguards must be taken to minimise the risk of cross infection8. Employers should avoid organising work-related events unless critical (e.g. training session): All work-related events9 that proceed must adhere to prevailing workplace Safe Management Measures and are subjected to the following requirements10: The number of persons per event must be capped at 50 persons to limit the risk of exposure to infection. Attendees must maintain at least 1 metre safe distancing between individual attendees, as per the requirement at the workplace. Food and drinks are not allowed at work-related events. Work-related events at third-party venues11 will also be subject to any additional premise owners’ safe management policies. Social gatherings at the workplace are disallowed: Employees should have their meal breaks at the workplace individually. Wear masks at the workplace: Employers must ensure that all onsite personnel, including employees, visitors, suppliers and contractors, wear a mask and other necessary personal protective equipment13 at all times at the workplace, except during activities that require masks to be removed14. Masks will have to be worn immediately after the activity is completed. Employers should ensure that they have sufficient masks for all employees, including any need to replace masks more frequently due to workplace conditions15. Where possible, employers should consider improving the working environment for employees to enable them to sustain wearing the masks. Observe good personal hygiene: Employers should encourage their employees to observe good personal hygiene, e.g. wash their hands regularly and refrain from touching their face. B. Take care of the workplace Control access at the workplace to only essential employees and authorised visitors. Employers must use the SafeEntry visitor management system to record the entry of all personnel (including employees and visitors) entering the workplace16. All employees and visitors should check-in and check-out of workplaces using SafeEntry (with their TraceTogether app or token) to help MOH in establishing potential transmission chains. Personnel who are unwell (including having a fever upon temperature screening) must be refused entry to the workplace. Visitors who are unwell should be asked to reschedule their appointments to another day when they are well, or be served via alternate means.17 Employers must ensure that employees and visitors must declare via SafeEntry or other means18 (e.g. electronic or hard copy records), before being allowed to enter premises, that they: Are currently not under a Quarantine Order, Stay-Home Notice; Have not had close contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case in the past 14 days19; and Do not have any fever or flu-like symptoms. Adhere to travel advisories: Employers should ensure that their employees adhere to MOH’s prevailing travel advisory. Where physical interaction cannot be avoided, precautions should be taken to ensure clear physical spacing of at least 1 metre through physical means20 and demarcation of safe physical distances (at least 1m apart) using visual indicators, where possible, in the following situations21: Between all persons at meeting rooms, work areas, and workstations; and At all times during work-related events held at the workplace. Employers who are service buyers should also require their suppliers / contractors to implement similar safe distancing measures, so that operations and business interactions with these suppliers / contractors are kept safe. Where physical interactions are still necessary, e.g. delivery of goods, employers must adopt precautionary measures such as scheduling delivery times by different suppliers in a staggered manner. The durations of such transactions should be kept as short as possible. Minimise need for physical touchpoints: Employers should reduce the occurrences of, or need for common physical touchpoints in the workplace where possible (e.g. by deploying contactless access controls). Where physical contact is needed, additional safeguards must be taken to minimise the risk of cross infection (e.g. frequent disinfection of touchpoints). Step up cleaning of workplace premises through the following: Employers must ensure regular cleaning of common spaces, particularly areas with high human contact22. Where physical meetings are held or meals are taken at common spaces such as pantries or canteens, employers must clean and disinfect tables between each meeting or seating. Employers must ensure that machinery and equipment shared between different employees across different shifts or alternate teams are cleaned and disinfected before changing hands. The sanitation and hygiene advisories23 disseminated by the National Environmental Agency (NEA) must be adhered to. Provide cleaning and disinfecting agents at the following areas: Cleaning agents (e.g. liquid soap, toilet paper) must be available at all toilets and hand-wash stations. Disinfecting agents (e.g. hand sanitisers) must be installed at all human traffic stoppage points within the workplace, such as entrances, reception areas, security booths and lift lobbies. Disinfecting agents (e.g. disinfectant sprays, paper towels and wipes) must be provided at meeting rooms and other common spaces such as pantries or canteens. C. Take care of workers who become unwell at the workplace Ensure regular checks for temperature and respiratory symptoms24 for all onsite employees and visitors, twice daily or where relevant. Employers must be able to demonstrate that these checks are in place during inspections. Record proximity data on phones: To help MOH to more quickly identify potential close contacts of COVID-19 patients and reduce disease transmission, employers should encourage all employees to download and activate the TraceTogether app25. Actively monitor unwell employees and guard against incipient outbreaks: Employees at the workplace who have visited a clinic must submit to their employers records of their MCs and diagnoses provided (only for COVID-19-related symptoms, including acute respiratory infections), and if they were tested for COVID-19 and the results of their tests. Employers must take preventive action to guard against incipient outbreaks at the workplace, such as advising employees who are unwell to stay home and consult a doctor rather than going to the workplace, requiring these employees on MCs to closely monitor their health before returning to the workplace and requiring these employees’ close contacts at the workplace to monitor their health more regularly. Where possible, employers should ensure that each employee visits only one clinic for check-ups if unwell. Otherwise, employees should inform the clinic of all recent doctor visits over past 14 days for any symptoms that may be related to COVID-1926. Manage unwell cases: An evacuation plan must be prepared for unwell or suspected cases, as well as for other onsite personnel. Any employee who is feeling unwell or showing symptoms of illness should report to his employer, leave the workplace and consult a doctor immediately, even if symptoms may appear mild. Employers must track and record these cases as part of Safe Management Measures. For incapacitated or unconscious individuals, employers must clear the area of other personnel and administer aid immediately. Employers should call 995 for an emergency ambulance to ferry them to the nearest hospital. Manage confirmed cases: A follow-up plan must be put in place in the event of a confirmed case. Upon being notified of a confirmed case, employers must adopt the following precautionary measures: Immediately vacate and cordon-off the immediate section of the workplace premises where the confirmed case worked. There is no need to vacate the building or the whole floor if there had been no sustained and close contact with the confirmed case; and Carry out a thorough cleaning and disinfecting all relevant on-site areas and assets that were exposed to confirmed cases, in accordance to NEA guidelines. For worksites with confirmed cases, businesses could be suspended if there are public health grounds. D. Implement a system of Safe Management Measures Employers must establish a system to implement the above Safe Management Measures to provide a safe working environment and minimise risks of COVID-19 outbreaks. These measures must be implemented in a sustainable manner for as long as necessary. Implement a detailed monitoring plan to ensure compliance with Safe Management Measures and timely resolution of outstanding issues27. Appoint Safe Management Officer(s) (“SMO”) to assist in the implementation, coordination and monitoring of the system of Safe Management Measures at the workplace. For unionised companies, union leaders or WSH officers could be appointed as SMOs. Employers must provide appointed SMOs with adequate instruction, information and supervision as is necessary for them to fulfil their required duties. SMOs are strongly encouraged to receive training. The duties of the Officer(s) include: To coordinate implementation of Safe Management Measures, including identifying relevant risks, recommending and assisting in implementing measures to mitigate the risks, and communicating the measures to all personnel working in the workplace; To conduct inspections and checks, to ensure compliance at all times. Any non-compliance found during the inspections should be reported and documented; To remedy non-compliance found during the inspections and checks through immediate action; and To keep records of inspections, checks and correction actions, to be made available upon request by a Government Inspector. Employers must ensure that the measures above are in place, communicated and explained to employees prior to resuming work onsite (refer to Annex B for a checklist of Safe Management Measures that should be in place for resumption of business activities). Signs should also be put up to remind employees and visitors to observe all measures in place. Unionised companies should engage their unions on such arrangements. Employees should also do their part in adhering to the measures to create a safe working environment. Those who wish to report breaches or poor practices can do so via SnapSAFE, an app that allows the reporting of workplace safety and health issues to MOM. You may refer to the frequently asked questions on Safe Management Measures at the workplace after Circuit Breaker period.

More info about the various sector-specific requirements. Annex A provides a list of resources such as technology solutions and grants available to assist companies. Those who have a compromised or impaired immune system. Workplace hours here refers to the hours spent at the physical workplace. E.g. arrange for different groups of employees to arrive / depart through different entrances / exits. This will not apply to industries / companies that need to do so due to the nature of their work. Such companies will be required to demonstrate that cross-deployment or interaction between employees is critical for business operations, when requested by MOM or their sector agencies. E.g. systems are in place to ensure no direct contact between the cross-deployed personnel. I.e. events not organised primarily for social interaction. Work-related events that are allowed to proceed are those which primarily involve employees or stakeholders, such as conferences / seminars, corporate retreats, staff training sessions, Annual General Meetings and Extraordinary General Meetings. This is separate and distinct from MICE events approved by the Singapore Tourism Board (STB). Work-related events are allowed to resume at third-party venues, but are subject to any additional premise owners’ safe management policies. <nil> Masks for general office workplaces; for other workplace settings, please refer to sector-specific guidelines. The requirement for masks to be worn can be waived when carrying out, in the course of employment, an activity that requires that no mask may be worn, or that it must be removed in order that other equipment may be worn or used, to carry out that activity, or when riding a motorcycle in the course of employment or otherwise. E.g. humid workplaces, call centres where the nature of the work may necessitate frequent mask changing. For the full list of workplaces where SafeEntry must be deployed, please refer to Such as tele-conferencing. Not applicable for individuals seeking treatment at a medical facility. Not applicable to COVID-19 frontline workers or recovered individuals within 3 months of their first positive PCR COVID-19 test. E.g. barriers between workstations, relocation of workstations, meeting room seats. The monitoring and enforcement of safe distancing could be aided by appropriate technology (e.g. CCTVs, video analytics) where possible. Such as counters where customers are served, rooms where visitors are hosted, as well as general public access areas such as lifts, pantries, toilets, and bin areas (including bin centres where necessary). Including coughing, sneezing, breathlessness, a runny nose, or loss of sense of smell. Data recorded by TraceTogether is stored on the user’s device, and is shared with MOH for contact-tracing purposes when the user is suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19. Including but not limited to typical symptoms such as fever, cough and shortness of breath. E.g. follow-up on non-compliance and efforts to mitigate risks. Employers should note that interns, part-time staff, etc. who are under a contract of service are also employees.', 'id': 'a2a69ee8-f648-41bd-9c47-2ded22e928a4', 'score': None, 'probability': None, 'question': None, 'meta': {'category': 'advisories'}, 'embedding': None},\n",
       " {'text': 'Phase Two (Heightened Alert) - Tighter measures for religious activities This document provides the conditions under which religious organisations (ROs) are permitted to carry out activities in places of worship during Phase Two (Heightened Alert) from 16 May through 13 June 2021. 15 May 2021 On 14 May 2021, the Multi-Ministry Taskforce announced tighter measures to be put in place from 16 May through 13 June 2021 to mitigate the risk of further community spread of COVID-19. This document provides the conditions under which religious organisations (ROs) are permitted to carry out activities in places of worship during this period of Phase Two (Heightened Alert). Phase Two (Heightened Alert) Under Phase Three (Heightened Alert) that began on 8 May 2021, enhanced precautionary measures were imposed on religious activities, namely a decrease in capacity for congregational and other worship services from 250 persons to 100 persons, without pre-event testing (PET), and no congregational singing. Under Phase Two (Heightened Alert), from 16 May through 13 June 2021, tighter measures will apply to religious activities. To reduce risks of community transmission, indoor “mask-off” activities will cease during this period. We will also further reduce the current permissible group size from up to 5 persons, to up to 2 persons. The new measures are as follows: a. Congregational and other worship services will be limited to 100 persons (decrease from 250 persons today) i. Up to 50 persons without PET; ii. Up to 100 persons with PET for all attendees; b. No singing and playing of wind/brass instruments for live performance elements; c. Suspension of all other non-congregational religious activities, except for religious rites; and d. Reduced capacity for marriage solemnizations as well as wakes, funerals and post-funeral rites. Annex A summarises the key changes for ROs going from Phase Three (Heightened Alert) to Phase Two (Heightened Alert). Worship Services From 16 May 2021, ROs may conduct congregational and other worship services at places of worship, with up to 50 persons at a time without PET, subject to safe management measures and the safe capacity of the premises. Religious and supporting workers should be kept to a minimum. Worshippers can participate in worship services in groups of no more than 2 persons (decrease from 5 persons today), in line with prevailing national requirements. ROs can conduct congregational and other worship services, for more than 50 persons and up to 100 persons at a time, only if there is PET for all worshippers1 as follows: a. ROs must ensure that all worshippers [except where paragraph (b) below applies] obtain a negative COVID-19 test result before they may be admitted into the venue where the service is being held.2 i. The test must be an MOH-approved COVID-19 test (either an Antigen Rapid Test (ART) or Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test) administered by an approved test provider.3 ii. The test results are only valid for 24 hours from the time an individual registers at the testing premises to take the test. The RO must ensure that the result of the test is valid until the end of the worshipper’s participation in the worship service. iii. The worshipper must be able to produce proof of the test result, which are either (i) Check-in Successful banner (displayed on the SafeEntry (Business) application upon scanning with TraceTogether App/Token), (ii) COVID-19 Test Result Notice (ART), (iii) COVID-19 Test Result Notice (PCR), or (iv) Patient Risk Profile Portal (PRPP) ART Result Slip. b. The requirements for PET in paragraph 6(a) above do not apply to worshippers who have been vaccinated4 or produce an exemption notice5. Before being admitted into the venue where the service is being held, the worshipper must produce valid documentation of either their vaccination or exemption notice which must remain valid until the end of the worshipper’s participation in the service. c. Where PET is required for a service, ROs must prominently display signs at each point of entry and exit (including emergency exit) to the venue where the service is being held, to indicate: i. The space is a restricted place6, and the duration for which it will be a restricted place (i.e. the duration of the service). ROs must clearly mark the boundaries of the restricted place (e.g. though fencing, rope, signs, walls, partition, screen). ii. That entry and remaining within the restricted place is allowed only to individuals with a cleared status (i.e. have a valid negative COVID-19 test result notice, valid documentation of vaccination or exemption notice). d. ROs are to highlight to worshippers attending services for more than 50 persons and up to 100 persons that they will be denied entry into the venue where the service is being held if they do not produce the relevant negative COVID-19 test result notice, vaccination notice, or exemption notice, with the necessary validity period. For congregational and other worship services exceeding 50 persons and up to 100 persons with PET, worshippers have to be segregated into zones holding no more than 50 persons each. a. As there should be no mingling of individuals across zones, each zone must be completely separated from another by either a physical solid partition (at least 1.8m high if not floor-to-ceiling, from wall-to-wall); or at least 3m physical spacing demarcated by continuous physical barriers (e.g. rope barrier). b. There must either be a separate ingress/egress for each zone or staggered entrance/exit timings so that worshippers from different zones do not mix with one another during entry/exit. c. ROs must also take reasonable steps to ensure that worshippers do not cross the physical barrier (where applicable) or enter another zone that they are not assigned to. ROs should continue to observe the following safe management measures for worship services (including services conducted with PET): a. Keep worship services to as short a duration as possible. There must be no reception or mingling between worshippers, before, during or after each worship service. b. All persons present (except children below 6 years of age) must wear a face mask at all times.7 Face shields are not permitted as substitutes for face masks. Young children are still strongly encouraged to use a mask, especially when they are in a group setting (e.g. attending worship service). c. Live performance elements are permitted during the worship service at places of worship, with the following safe management measures (see Annex B for details). i. A maximum of 30 persons are allowed to be involved in/support the conduct of the worship service. This includes persons on-stage, backstage or off-stage. ii. Unmasking will not be permitted. To ensure the safety of worshippers, singing or playing of wind/brass instruments will also not be permitted. iii. Singing (with or without the mask on) is not allowed. iv. Masks must be worn when speaking during congregational and other worship services. A face shield is not a permitted substitute for a proper mask. v. There must be at least a 3-metre setback between persons involved in the conduct of live performance elements and worshippers. vi. Minimise the duration of live performance elements for congregational and other worship services. d. There should be no sharing of prayer and other common items (e.g. holy books, passing of offertory baskets, prayer mats) as this increases the risk of COVID-19 transmission. Worshippers are to bring along their personal prayer items instead, where required. e. Places of worship with reduced air circulation (e.g. enclosed prayer spaces, air-conditioned worship hall) should, where possible, open doors and windows to naturally ventilate the space after each use. Marriage Solemnizations From 16 May 2021, ROs may continue to use places of worship to conduct marriage solemnizations where: a. Solemnizations involving up to 50 attendees: PET will not be required. b. Solemnizations involving between 51 - 100 attendees: PET will be required for all attendees.8 c. These activities are subject to safe management measures and the safe capacity of the premises, and exclude the solemnizer and religious and supporting workers, whose numbers should be kept to a minimum. d. If the total number of attendees is more than 50 (including the wedding couple), they must still be segregated into zones of up to 50 persons each (see paragraph 7 for zoning requirements). An individual attending the solemnization must remain within his or her respective assigned zone and must not enter an unassigned zone. e. Attendees must maintain a 1-metre safe distance between groups except a core “wedding party”9, which is allowed to comprise up to 20 persons (including the couple and their two witnesses). There should be no intermingling or mixing between groups nor between the “wedding party” and these other groups. f. There must not be any reception with food and drinks, or wedding celebrations that are not essential religious rites. g. ROs must also comply with prevailing safe management measures stipulated on the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI)’s website10. Although solemnizations at places of worship11 may continue to involve live instrumental music (non-wind/brass) with the necessary safe management measures in place (see Annex C), we strongly encourage this to be suspended or the duration be shortened during this period of heightened alert. Persons involved in/supporting the live instrumental music segment should be kept to the minimum. No other performances (e.g. singing, dance, variety act) are allowed. ROs are strongly encouraged to continue offering video link solemnizations as an option for couples. Funerals From 16 May 2021, funerals, wakes, installation of niches and post-funeral rites12 at places of worship can involve not more than 20 attendees (decrease from 30 today) at any one time, including the day of burial/cremation, and in groups of no more than 2 persons (excluding religious and supporting workers, whose numbers should be kept to a minimum), subject to safe management measures and the safe capacity of the premises. a. There must not be any reception with food and drinks. b. ROs must also comply with prevailing safe management measures listed on MTI’s website13. Funerary-related activities at places of worship14 may continue to involve live instrumental music (non-wind/brass) with the necessary safe management measures in place (see Annex C). Persons involved in/supporting the live instrumental music segment should be kept to the minimum. No other performances (e.g. singing, dance, variety act) are allowed. Visits to columbaria at places of worship should be kept as short as possible, with no mingling between groups of no more than 2 persons (decrease from 5 persons today). Other Religious Activities From 16 May 2021, ROs may continue to use places of worship to conduct religious rites, in groups of no more than 2 persons (decrease from 5 persons today) and maintain safe distancing. Religious and supporting workers involved in the conduct of these rites should be kept to a minimum. All other religious activities (e.g. religious classes for adults and children) will be suspended. Given the current need to minimise the risk of COVID-19 transmission, ROs are strongly encouraged to conduct these activities via remote means or defer them until the COVID-19 situation improves. Recording and Broadcast of Religious Services and Prayers ROs are encouraged to continue supporting the religious needs of their communities via remote means such as recording and broadcast of religious services and prayers. From 16 May 2021, ROs can have up to 15 persons on-location for these productions, of which up to 10 persons can be unmasked at any one time, with no more than 2 persons unmasked for singing and/or playing wind/brass instruments. Those singing and/or playing wind/brass instruments must maintain 2 metres between all other individuals. All other persons present must maintain a 1-metre separation. The time spent on-location for this activity should be kept as short as possible. The production team must also put in place safe management measures, including no-cross deployment between locations, and thorough cleaning of technical equipment. There shall be no audience. ROs who wish to use their premises for digital recording or broadcast are required to notify through the CPRO website of (i) the planned dates of the digital productions; (ii) venue; and (iii) confirmation of adherence to the performers and crew limits, before conducting the digital productions. Safe capacity in the place of worship All the permitted religious activities in paragraphs 9 to 19 (i.e. excluding congregational and other worship services) can continue to take place concurrently, subject to safe management measures, and stipulated capacity limits for these activities – and only if these activities can be conducted safely at separate locations within the place of worship, with no interaction between worshippers while entering, exiting or while in the premises. ROs are strongly encouraged to support the religious needs of their communities through remote means, as far as possible, in line with national guidelines to reduce social interactions, and thus minimise risk of COVID-19 transmission. a. ROs should consider reducing other concurrent activities when congregational and other worship services are ongoing, so that there is a smaller total number of people on the premises at any one time, which will help to minimise the risk of large clusters from forming. Deployment of manpower ROs should primarily engage their religious workers and staff to support the permitted religious activities but can deploy volunteers to support if necessary. The number of personnel involved in conducting each permitted activity should be kept to a minimum. From 16 May 2021, telecommuting will be the default for workplaces, so as to minimise the number of on-site religious workers and staff. The religious workers and administrative staff should comply with prevailing workplace safe management measures stipulated by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM).15 Restrictions against cross-deployment16 across worksites remain in place. TraceTogether and SafeEntry TraceTogether-only SafeEntry, where the TraceTogether App or Token is required for SafeEntry check-ins, will be required at all venues that are required to implement SafeEntry from 17 May 202117. ROs must make the necessary preparations to accept check-ins by the TraceTogether App or Token. ROs can refer to www.safeentry.gov.sg for FAQs, or more information on how to set up TraceTogether-only SafeEntry for their premises. SafeEntry Gateway (SEGW) will be progressively introduced as an additional mode of SafeEntry check-in to provide quicker and more seamless check-in using the TraceTogether App or Token. Existing modes of SafeEntry check-in will remain in place. Since 19 Apr 2021, ROs conducting congregational and other worship services for more than 100 persons have been required to deploy the SafeEntry Gateway at their main entrances as an additional check-in mode. ROs conducting congregational and other worship services for 100 persons or less will also be required to deploy the SEGW at their main entrances by 15 June 2021. ROs may deploy either the physical SEGW Box or use the SEGW function found in the latest version of the SafeEntry (Business) App based on their needs. [Refer to for more information.]. Mandatory submission of Safe Management Plans ROs must acknowledge through the CPRO website the new conditions for religious activities imposed from 16 May through 13 June 2021 before commencing the activities. ROs that have not submitted their Safe Management Plans (SMPs) previously for Phase 3 will need to submit their plans, at least 2 days before commencing any activities outlined above. The detailed requirements and format for submitting these SMPs can be found at www.cpro.gov.sg. MCCY reserves the right to suspend a RO’s activities if there are gaps in the SMP submitted and until the necessary rectifications are made. ROs are responsible for the implementation of safe management measures and action could be taken for lapses and breaches. Should there be any confirmed COVID-19 cases linked to a RO’s premises or place of worship, the premises may be closed for a period of time as determined by the authorities. Working together to make Singapore COVID-safe The tightening of measures for religious activities reflect the seriousness of the current COVID-19 situation. We will have to remain vigilant and regularly refine our safe management measures in order to minimise the risk of COVID-19 transmission. MCCY will continue to work with our ROs to ensure a COVID-19 safe environment for religious activities.

       " {'text': '1 Issued: 14 May 2021 Updated: 18 May 2021 Issued: 14 May 2021 Updated: 18 May 2021 FURTHER STRICTER SAFE MANAGEMENT MEASURES FOR SPORT AND PHYSICAL EXERCISE & ACTIVITY (16 May to 13 June 2021) 1. On 14 May 2021, the Multi-Ministry Taskforce announced that with effect from 16 May to 13 June 2021, there will be further tightening of safe management measures to curb the transmission of COVID-19 within the community. To reduce risks of community transmission, indoor “mask-off” activities will cease during this period. The current permissible group size of up to 5 persons will also be reduced to no more than 2 persons. 2. Following that announcement, Sport Singapore is providing an updated guidance on the stricter set of measures that concerns all sports, physical exercises & activities, and public & private sports & recreational facilities in Singapore for the period of 16 May to 13 June 2021. These measures are directed towards reducing or containing community spread of COVID-19 by stopping sport and physical activities that take place in high-risk environments. In general, high-risk environments are enclosed, indoor spaces (fully enclosed on all sides), where participants are likely to engage in strenuous activities unmasked. As a result, no strenuous physical activities should take place in any indoor spaces regardless of size (including Indoor Sports Halls and atriums in shopping malls). There are also further restrictions on density and group size as well as outdoor and indoor exercise classes. 3. The updated measures described in this guidance have to be adhered to starting 16 May 2021 and ending at the end of 13 June 2021 and supersedes the guidance issued on 7 May 2021. Additionally, this guidance has been updated on 18 May 2021 to include paragraph 3A & 3B on the measures introduced to safeguard the well-being of children and youths 1 . SUSPENSION OF SPORT / PHYSICAL ACTIVITY CLASSES / PROGRAMMES FOR 18 YEARS & BELOW, FROM 19 MAY 3A. Aligning to the Ministry of Education’s announcements on 16 and 18 May 2021 to reduce the intermingling of students from different schools and enhance the safety of students, all indoor sport / physical activity classes / programmes regardless of class size that cater to individuals who are 18 years (born in 2003) and below, are to be suspended or moved online. This takes effect from 19 May to 13 June 2021 or till further notice. 3B. Outdoor sport / physical activity for this age group1 shall be restricted to only 1 coach to 1 student/trainee.

The physical distancing3 between individuals and groups of up to 2 individuals must be maintained while exercising and playing sport. i. For organised programmes and classes that take place indoors, an additional service provider (such as an instructor or a coach) from a permitted enterprise may guide the group. Multiple groups of 2 remain allowable up to 30 participants or the capacity limit of the venue, whichever is lower. The groups of 2 are not to intermingle before, during and after the class, and must remain 3 metres apart. Refer to subsequent paragraphs on restricting all indoor activities to low intensity activities with masks on at all times. ii. For organised programmes and classes that take place outdoors, an additional service provider (such as an instructor or a coach) from a permitted enterprise may guide the group. Multiple groups of 2 remain allowable up to 30 participants or the capacity limit of the venue, whichever is lower, if the activity is of low intensity with masks on at all times. The groups of 2 are not to intermingle before, during, and after the class, and must remain 3 metres apart. If the activity is of high intensity where masks have to be removed, including for swimming, only two persons are allowed (including instructor or coach) and there can be no multiple groups of 2. iii. Physical activity of a social nature should be kept to 2 participants. c. Large complexes or multi-function premises such as country clubs may treat different parts of their premises as separate facilities, provided that they are well separated by physical barriers such that intermingling is not possible. LOW INTENSITY SPORT & PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES IN INDOOR ENVIRONMENTS 5. Physical activities, sport and exercise environments that are indoors 4 , where participants are in close contact, exerting and are not reasonably expected to be wearing masks, will not be allowed. a. All indoor facilities may only allow low intensity sport and physical activities with masks on at all times. Indoor high risk environments, i.e. indoor public and private gyms and fitness/exercise/dance studios5 , including those operated by 2 The Gross Floor Area includes exercises spaces, as well as other spaces such as changing rooms, rest areas within the facility. Facilities up to 32 sqm can admit up to 2 persons; this does not include staff. 3 A 2-metre physical distancing between individuals should be maintained while exercising and playing sport. If there is more than one group sharing a space, the groups must not interact and must maintain a distance of 3 metres apart from one another at all times. 4 Defined as premises which are fully enclosed on all sides. 5 Premises identified as high-risk physical activities, sport and exercise environments include, but are not limited to, indoor fitness training facilities, indoor gyms, as well as fitness studios and similar indoor studio settings for climb walls, trampoline, dance, barre, spin, etc. Such indoor premises (and including any other type of indoor premises such as hotel, club or condominium function rooms) must not be allowed to be used, or hired out to others for use for any high intensity sport and physical activities where participants are in close contact, exerting and not wearing masks during the stipulated period. 3 Issued: 14 May 2021 Updated: 18 May 2021 commercial enterprises, country clubs, golf clubs, private apartments, condominiums and charities, are to close during the stipulated period, unless they only offer low intensity physical activities, sport and exercises where all participants and instructors are wearing masks at all times b. No such facility will be allowed to offer weight, strength or resistance training of any form, and/or provide equipment for such training, as these are associated with strenuous activities. c. Participants, instructors and staff of these facilities also have to adhere to a more stringent set of safe management measures (SMMs) per Annex. d. Premises may be used by a coach/instructor for the purposes of producing digital content for online classes. Sport Singapore will have to be notified beforehand at Sport_Covid@sport.gov.sg to confirm adherence to prevailing SMMs for digital content production. There shall be no other activities at the premises when digital content production is taking place. 6. For a list of affected Sport Singapore’s indoor facilities and programmes during this period, please visit Refunds for affected bookings that fall under these dates will be processed within the next seven working days. LARGE GROUP OUTDOOR CLASSES 7. Approved large outdoor classes at public spaces such as parks and HDB common areas, can continue, subject to the venue size and safe distancing requirements as stated in paragraph 4(b)ii. All instructors must also be registered with Sport Singapore.6 8. Sport Singapore is looking into the provision of more outdoor spaces within its ActiveSG facilities for coaches and instructors to conduct their classes. The mechanism to apply for these spaces will be announced to the community when ready. OTHER SAFE MANAGEMENT MEASURES 9. Other safe management measures will continue to be in place. These include, but are not limited to: a. Mask wearing. Masks should be worn as a default. If an individual is engaged in an outdoor activity of high intensity by himself or with another person (i.e. no more than 2 in the group), masks may be removed for the activity. Maintain social distancing from other groups. Those performing permitted low intensity sport and physical activity in an indoor environment are required to wear a mask at all times. The activity has to cease immediately, if any participant removes his or her mask, even for a short while to breathe. 6 Instructors who are interested to conduct large outdoor classes at outdoor public spaces must be registered and can do so via Subsequent approval from facility owner need to be sought before activities can be conducted. 4 Issued: 14 May 2021 Updated: 18 May 2021 b. Sharing of common equipment should be avoided. Participants in an indoor environment should not share sport and exercise equipment, such as exercise machines, bars, free weights, stationary bikes, treadmills, exercise mats where fomite transmission risk is high. No premises that remain open is to provide such equipment for use. c. Reducing Physical Interaction & Hygiene and Ensuring Safe Distancing. Owners or operators of facilities are responsible for ensuring safe management measures are implemented, and that their patrons/users comply. Facility owners/operators will have to: i. Organise human traffic flow and space management to ensure that the mixing of groups is minimised to transient contact; ii. Put in place measures to minimise crowding or mixing at common facilities e.g. toilets. Where possible, specific common facilities should be designated to specific zones so that attendees from different zones do not mix when using such facilities; iii. Conduct temperature screening7 and checks on visible symptoms8 for visitors, and turn away those with fever and/or who appear unwell. SafeEntry must be implemented for participants and visitors. From 17 May 2021 onwards, all participants and staff are to use either the TraceTogether app or the TraceTogether Tokens for SafeEntry; iv. Frequently disinfect common spaces and interactive components (e.g. smart kiosks, turnstiles). Operators are strongly encouraged to adopt good sanitation and hygiene practices to achieve the SG Clean quality mark; v. Place hand sanitisers in close proximity of the facility entrance and high-touch surfaces like door handles. Attendees should be encouraged to sanitise their hands before entering and upon leaving the facility; vi. Ensure that participants do not shout while engaging in physical activities. This is because shouting increases the risk of transmission via droplets. Coaches/instructors may raise their volume when communicating instructions or in the event of a potential danger. SPORT EVENTS FROM 8 MAY TO 13 JUNE 2021 10. As part of ongoing efforts to reduce the community spread, Sport Singapore will maintain the tightening on sport events during the stipulated period: a. Mass participation sport events will not be permitted to take place. Organisers are to work with Sport Singapore to cancel or postpone the events to a later date. b. All other sport events, including live spectator sport events, sport competitions and tournaments, will be subject to approval before they can proceed. There will be no spectators allowed at sport events and competitions. National Sports Associations 7 Individuals with temperatures 38 degrees celsius and above are considered as having a fever. 8 Notable visible symptoms to look out for include: (a) coughing; (b) sneezing; (c) breathlessness; and (d) a runny nose. 5 Issued: 14 May 2021 Updated: 18 May 2021 that are organising competitions and tournaments related to qualifications for international competitions for national athletes, should approach Sport Singapore early to discuss their plans. The above applies to all sport events, including those that have previously been endorsed by Sport Singapore. ENFORCEMENT 11. Government agencies will be conducting inspections. Enforcement action(s) under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act and the Infectious Diseases Act will be taken against businesses or individuals who fail to comply with safe management measures. EVERYONE HAS A PART TO PLAY AGAINST COVID-19 12. Singaporeans are urged to remain vigilant and observe safe distancing measures in place to minimise community transmissions. We all have a part to play in keeping COVID-19 at bay, and protect ourselves and our loved ones. 13.

All participants, including instructors and staff, must be properly masked at all times, including when performing the physical activity; b. Staggered class start times to allow for a minimum of 15 minutes between classes and/or put in place separate routes if a premise is able to host multiple classes at a time. This is to prevent intermingling and mixing between participants before and after class. Operators will have to ventilate the room after each class ends. Participants must leave the premises immediately once they have completed their classes, or if they have exceeded a two-hour period; c. Organised programmes and classes are limited to no more than 30 persons or lower subject to the venue size and safe distancing requirements, and in groups of no more than 2 persons; d. Physical distancing of 2 metres between individuals must be maintained in general while exercising, and 3 metres between different groups must be maintained at all times. There shall be no intermingling between groups before, during and after classes; e. There must be no provision of common equipment to minimise fomite transmission. Sharing of any equipment should be avoided (e.g. weights, exercise mats). The premises must be wiped down / sanitised frequently to minimise the risk of COVID-19 transmission; f. Food and drink must not be supplied or consumed within the activity area, except if the consumption of a drink is necessary to preserve life or prevent injury in an emergency; g. Ensure that participants, including the instructor, do not talk loudly, sing, or shout while engaging in physical activities to minimise risk of transmission via droplets.

       " {'text': '1 UPDATED AS OF 15 MAY 2021 FAQS FOR MANAGEMENT CORPORATIONS (MCSTs) AND MANAGING AGENTS (MAs) Convening of Annual General Meeting (AGM) Q1. When should a MCST hold the next annual general meeting? A1. Under section 27(1) of the Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act (BMSMA), a MCST shall hold the second or subsequent annual general meeting (AGM) in each calendar year and not more than 15 months from the last preceding AGM. * Under Section 26(1) of BMSMA, the owner developer shall hold the first AGM of MCST latest by the 13th month from the date of constitution of MCST. Q2. Can MCSTs conduct AGMs via electronic means? A2. MCSTs may do so. Please refer to the circular and guidance notes, dated 7 April 2021, issued by BCA at Q3. What must a subsidiary proprietor (SP) do if he/she wishes to stand for election of council member in a general meeting conducted via electronic means? A3. If an SP wishes to be nominated to stand for the election of council member, we encourage him/her to send his/her name by writing or email to the Secretary of MCST at least 48 hours before the start of the meeting. Alternatively, he/she may attend the general meeting via electronic means and inform the Chairperson of the meeting of the intention to be nominated for election of council member. Q4. How does an MCST go about arranging for an AGM conducted by electronic means? Will BCA recommend any vendor for this purpose? A4. The MCST should refer to the circular and guidance notes, dated 7 April 2021, issued by BCA ( The MCST should also engage or appoint a vendor who can provide the services of conducting the AGM via electronic means, which can meet the requirements set in the guidance note. BCA does not recommend or restrict the type or group of vendors whom MCSTs can engage or appoint for this purpose.2 Q5. Can an MCST hold a physical AGM? A5. An MCST can hold a physical AGM with no more than 50 persons attending the meeting in person together, or such number of persons who can be accommodated at the venue where there is at least one metre safe distancing between any two individuals, whichever is lower. MCSTs conducting physical AGMs must comply with the relevant Safe Management Measures (SMMs) as laid out in the circular and guidance notes, dated 7 April 2021, issued by BCA ( Depending on the venue size, the attendance cap could be lower than 50 persons in order to comply with the SMMs. For AGMs expecting to have an attendance that exceeds 50 persons or the number of persons that can be accommodated at the venue in compliance with the SMMs, MCSTs are advised to conduct the meetings by electronic means. Attendees must maintain at least 1 metre safe distancing between other attendees at all times during the AGM. Attendees must wear masks at all times during the AGM. Attendees must minimise socialising among one another at all times during the AGM. Socialising before or after the AGM should also be discouraged. Q6. If MCST expects an attendance of more than 50 persons, can MCST conduct the AGM via both electronic means and physical meeting? A6. For AGMs expecting to have an attendance that exceeds 50 persons or the number of persons that can be accommodated at the venue in compliance with the safe management measures, MCSTs are advised to conduct the meetings by electronic means. Please refer to A4. MCST should take note of the real risk that more than 50 attendees will turn up at the physical location. When such situation arises, the MCST will be faced with the quandary of allowing more than 50 attendees in the meeting and breaching the 50 pax cap in the Control Order. The MCST may also find it difficult to handle a crowd larger than it had anticipated, and may have difficulties adhering to the safe management measures (such as at least 1 metre distancing between 2 individuals, due to the area of the meeting location). Further, if the MCST has to turn away attendees, the MCST may breach the rights of the attendees, who are subsidiary proprietors (“SPs”), to participate in the meeting. This will expose the MCST to possible challenges by the SPs that the proceedings of the general meeting are not proper or that the SPs are denied the right to vote at the meeting. Q7. Besides AGM, can an MCST or management Council hold any other types of meetings in person?3 A7. The MCST can hold physical extraordinary general meetings, with no more than 50 persons attending the meeting in person, or such number of persons who can be accommodated at the venue where there is at least one metre safe distancing between any two individuals, whichever is lower. This arrangement can also apply to physical council meetings held by management councils. MCSTs and management councils conducting physical meetings must comply with the relevant Safe Management Measures (SMMs), including SMMs in the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations. For more information, you may wish to refer to the circular and guidance notes, dated 7 April 2021, issued by BCA ( For meetings expecting to have an attendance that exceeds 50 persons or the number of persons that can be accommodated at the venue in compliance with the SMMs, MCSTs are advised to conduct the meetings by electronic means. Safe Management Measures [For the Period of 16 May to 13 June 2021 – both dates inclusive] Q8. Can MCST continue to allow indoor sports facilities to be opened? A8. All indoor gymnasiums and indoor fitness studios are to be closed till 13 June 2021, unless low intensity physical activities, sports and exercises are conducted , where all participants and instructors are wearing masks at all times, and where there is no sharing of any common equipment. These are activities that can be done with mask on at all times such as Yoga, Pilates, stretching exercises, Tai Chi, etc. There may have to be some modification to how it is done, e.g. without the use of equipment, during this period of time. Participants, instructors and staff also have to adhere to a more stringent set of safe management measures (SMMs). No facilities will be allowed to offer weight, strength or resistance training of any form, and/or provide equipment for such training, as these are associated with strenuous activities. Other indoor facilities similar to gym and studio settings that remain in operation are to modify their activities to be in line with the more stringent SMM. For indoor sports facilities such as sports hall, swimming pool and squash court are to be closed till 13 June 2021, unless low intensity physical activities, sports and exercises are conducted , where all participants and instructors are wearing masks at all times, and where there is no sharing of any common equipment. For other indoor sports such as basketball, badminton, table tennis and volleyball playing indoors, these activities have to be changed to low intensity with masks on in a group of no more than 2 persons (i.e. 1v1). While practice drills may still be possible, competitive sports will typically be high intensity and if allowed to proceed would put participants at risk of flouting the law. Therefore, we advise MCSTs to ensure that competitive sports do not take place and masks are worn at all times. MCSTs need to ensure that the residents using these facilities observe and comply with the safe management measures (SMMs) as laid out in the circular and guidance notes, dated 4 14 May 2021, issued by Sports SG. MCSTs can refer to the latest SMM advisory issued by Sports SG at Q9. How should the MCST compute the maximum number of persons who can use a sports facility at any one time? A9 Sports facilities (e.g. hard courts, swimming pools) should have capacity limits to avoid crowdedness and minimise the risk of large clusters forming. Refer to table below. Q10. The development has 3 separate swimming pools. Can the MCST aggregate or add up the areas of the 3 swimming pools to compute the maximum number of persons who can use the swimming pools? A10. No. The maximum number of persons who can use each swimming pool shall be computed from the usable area of each individual swimming pool. Q11. How is the usable area defined for a) swimming pool, b) other water-based facilities, c) other associated features (e.g. sauna), and d) hard courts? A11. For a) swimming pool and b) other water-based facilities, the usable area of the facility refers to its Plan Area and cut-off at the edge of the drain/edge of the wall of the facility, whichever is smaller. For c) other associated features, the usable area refers to the Plan Area of the facility, excluding shower/washing facilities like changing/shower room. For d) hard courts, the usable area of the facility refers to its Plan Area and cuts off at the fence/wall of the facility. Q12. The swimming pool is not of regular shape. How does the MCST determine the area? Usable Area of the Facility Maximum Capacity More than 50 square metres Should be limited to 1 person per 16 square metres of usable area or 50 persons, whichever is lower. Each group should be 3 metres apart and each person in the group should be 2 metres apart Smaller than 50 square metres Should be limited to 2 persons.5 A12. The MCST can refer to the building plan of the development for the Plan Area of the swimming pool. Alternatively, the MCST can draw the best possible approximation of a regular shape within the outline of the pool to facilitate calculation. In the example below, the dotted rectangle can be used to calculate the area of the pool (indicated in blue outline). Example Q13. The common swimming pool is linked or connected to the private pool of each housing unit (e.g. for units on the ground floor). When the MCST computes the maximum number of persons who can use the common swimming pool, should the area of the private pools be included? A13. No. The MCST should not include the area of the private pools as part of the area of the common pool to compute the maximum number of persons who can use the common swimming pool. Q14. Can individuals from different households use a facility together? A14. Individuals from different households can use a facility together. In general, the individuals should maintain a safe distance of at least 1 metre when using any facility. If a 1 metre safe distancing between individuals is not feasible or practical, it can be applied between groups of up to 2 persons, but there should be no mixing or interaction between groups which are using the same facility. Please see the illustration below. If the activities involve exercising or playing of sports, then a longer safe distance of 2~3 metres should be maintained. Q15. What are the common facilities that should be closed? >1m >1m6 A15. All outdoor barbeque pits must be closed till 13 June 2021. Q16. If the development has a large function room or event facility, can the MCST allow more than 2 persons to use the room/facility? A16. Any gathering conducted in the function rooms or event facilities, except for the holding of solemnisations, receptions, wakes/funerals, and post-funeral religious rites, shall be kept to a maximum of 2 persons, regardless of the size of the room. Q17. What are the requirements for holding solemnisations, receptions, and wakes/funerals in the common property within condominiums? A17. For marriage solemnisations, Marriage solemnisations may continue for up to 100 participants with pre-event testing (PET) and 50 participants without PET* under “Marriage Solemnisations and Receptions” at and FAQs at for further information. No wedding reception is allowed till 13 June 2021. For wakes and funerals, up to 20 persons (excluding funeral workers and vendors) will be allowed at any one time on all days. MCSTs can refer to the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations 2020 and the NEA’s guidelines ( for the full list of SMMs applicable. The number of attendees for the events is subject to the individual venue’s capacity limit based on safe management principles. MCSTs may also set additional conditions for the use of their facilities, such as a lower limit for attendance based on their capacity or ability to ensure that SMMs are implemented. Q18. What are the requirements for holding post-funeral religious rites in the common property within condominiums? A18. The number of attendees at the event should generally be kept to 20 persons or fewer at any time. This excludes any religious workers, which should be kept to a minimum. MCSTs can refer to the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations 2020 for the full list of SMMs applicable. Q19. Can MCSTs choose not to allow the holding of solemnisations, receptions, wakes/funerals or post-funeral religious rites in the common property within condominiums?7 A19. MCSTs have a duty to control, manage and administer the common property for the benefit of all subsidiary proprietors in the development, in accordance with the applicable by-laws (including prescribed by-law 18(2) in the Second Schedule to the Building Maintenance (Strata Management) Regulations). Therefore, MCSTs should assess and determine their capacity and ability to put in place the necessary SMMs for the respective event/activity, and may set additional conditions for the use of their premises. Otherwise, MCSTs can choose to disallow these events/activities within the development. As a good practice, MCSTs are encouraged to inform residents, for instance, through a circular or notice, should MCSTs decide to disallow these events/activities. Q20. Do MCST and security guards have the power to enforce if residents report non-compliances to safe distancing measures or safe management measures? A20. MCST and security guards should step up patrol of the common areas and ensure that residents observe the safe distancing measures implemented by the Government to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission. Residents can alert the security guards or MCST of any evidence of non-compliances to social distancing measures. Where necessary, the MCST can escalate the report to BCA at with detailed information (e.g. location, date and time, and photographic evidence). Q21. Some residents are not following guidelines to maintain safe distancing or are having large gathering at common areas or at their homes, what can we do? A21. Social gatherings of 2 persons in each group outside their homes are allowed under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations 2020 to combat the coronavirus outbreak. Further, each household may only receive up to 2 unique visitors per day. Failure to comply with all relevant requirements is an offence, and BCA will not hesitate to take enforcement action against errant parties. Any non-compliance to the safe management measures should be reported to your MCST or Managing Agents (MAs) immediately. MCSTs are expected to diligently monitor the situation within their estates, and promptly deal with any contraventions of the requirements. For recalcitrant cases, MCSTs/MAs may provide feedback to BCA ( with detailed information pertaining to any contravention of the requirements', 'id': '3868fa00-42ed-4091-ae0b-722c8a64acdf', 'score': None, 'probability': None, 'question': None, 'meta': {'category': 'advisories'}, 'embedding': None},\n",
       " {'text': 'Additional measures for community activities in light of heightened alert to manage COVID transmission, and support for the sector This document provides a summary of measures that will impact community activities under MCCY sectors during Phase Two (Heightened Alert) from 16 May through 13 June 2021. 15 May 2021 The Multi-Ministry Task Force (MTF) have announced a further tightening of measures following the recent clusters of infections and an emerging pattern of local unlinked community cases. Effective from 16 May 2021 to 13 June 2021, this tightening will impact several sectors under the purview of MCCY, as well as groups and individuals working in these sectors. However, these tighter measures are necessary for Singapore to quickly contain the situation to prevent an escalation, and to protect the safety of our community. MCCY has put together support for these sectors to assist them to make the adjustments during this period. Summary of measures for MCCY sectors The key measures that will impact MCCY sectors are as follows: Live Performances All indoor and outdoor live performances should be deferred. Live performances which have been publicised before 5 May 2021 and which are scheduled to take place from 8 May through 13 Jun 2021 may only proceed with approval from MTI. From 16 May 2021, audiences will be capped at 100 persons with pre-event testing (PET), and up to 50 persons without PET. All performers must be properly masked at all times on stage. Singing or playing of instruments that require intentional expulsion of air (e.g. wind and brass instruments) will not be permitted at all times. Digital productions and associated rehearsals Recording of digital productions and their associated rehearsals are limited to 15 performers and crew on stage and backstage at any given time. This includes a maximum of 10 unmasked performers (of which no more than two persons can sing or play wind/brass instruments). Arts and cultural organisations must notify NAC of their plans before proceeding with their digital productions and associated rehearsals. Arts and culture classes, lectures, talks and workshops All speakers, participants and instructors in arts and culture classes, lectures, talks and workshops must be properly masked at all times. Activities that cannot be conducted with masks on must be suspended. There are to be no classes in singing or wind and brass instruments, even if masked. Face shields are not permitted substitutes for proper masks. The National Arts Council has released more details on the above: Museums Arts and heritage venues such as museums can continue operations, but at a reduced capacity of 25%. Tours within museum premises may be conducted for a maximum group size of 20 persons (excluding guide), with maximum of two persons allowed in any one sub-group, with all other prevailing safe management measures in place such as social distancing. The National Heritage Board has released more details on the above: Sporting activities Capacity limits for indoor and outdoor facilities have been amended to one person per 16sqm, or 50 persons, whichever is lower. This is to ensure there is even more space between people who are exercising, to minimise risk of transmission. a) Indoor facilities In line with the measure to cease all indoor “mask-off” activities, only non-strenuous activities can continue in all indoor sports venues, and participants must be masked at all times. Activities which will result in participants lowering their masks to catch a breath will not be permitted. As previously announced, no sharing of common equipment will be permitted indoors to reduce fomite transmission. b) Outdoor facilities and activities Outdoors, individuals engaging in strenuous exercises may do so in groups of up to two persons (including any instructor), keeping 2m distance between individuals. They can be unmasked when exerting but should put on their masks thereafter. c) Indoor and Outdoor large group classes Indoor and outdoor group classes are capped at 30 persons (including the instructor) or the venue capacity cap, whichever is lower. All individuals must remain masked at all times. All instructors and participants must be masked at all times. Class participants must be in groups of no more than two, with 2m between individuals, and 3m between groups. Outdoor classes for strenuous activities which require participants to be unmasked, will be capped at two persons including the instructor. Sport Singapore (SportSG) has released more details on the above: Congregational and other worship services Congregational and other worship services will be limited to 100 persons with PET, or up to 50 persons at a time without PET. This is subject to safe management measures and the venue capacity limits of the premises. Religious workers support these services should be kept to a minimum. Worshippers can participate in worship services in groups of no more than two persons. Masks must be worn at all times by all persons including when speaking during congregational and other worship services. Face shields are not permitted substitutes for proper face masks. To reduce the risk of transmission, singing and the playing of wind/brass instruments will not be allowed. There should also be no sharing of prayer or common items. Other religious activities Religious Organisations (ROs) may continue to use places of worship to conduct religious rites, in groups of no more than two persons. All other religious activities (e.g. religious classes for adults and children) will be suspended. Digital productions and associated rehearsals Recording of digital productions at the place of worship are limited to 15 performers and crew on stage and backstage at any given time. This includes a maximum of 10 unmasked performers (of which no more than two persons can sing or play wind/brass instruments). ROs must notify MCCY of their plans before proceeding with their digital productions. Wedding solemnisations and Funeral rites Wedding solemnisations may continue, with up to 100 persons with PET, or up to 50 persons without PET, subject to venue capacity limits. The cap of 100 and 50 persons respectively, exclude the solemnizer and religious and supporting workers, whose numbers should be kept to a minimum. In line with curbs on dine-in F&B establishments, wedding receptions will not be allowed. Funerals, wakes, burial/cremations, installation of niches and post-funeral rites at places of worship can involve not more than 20 attendees at any time, subject to venue capacity limits. Attendees should be organised in groups of no more than two persons. The cap of 20 excludes religious and supporting workers, whose numbers should be kept to a minimum. Attendees are to maintain safe distancing and be masked at all times to reduce the risk of transmission. More details have been released separately: Support for MCCY sectors MCCY and our agencies have been focused on providing support to groups, businesses, and individuals within our sectors to manage the disruptions resulting from COVID-19, and to help them emerge stronger. Both the Arts and Culture Resilience Package and the Sports Resilience Package have been dedicated to tide our sectors throughout the pandemic. Arts & Culture The Arts and Culture Resilience Package has been topped up over the past year to the current $75M. This funds operating grants, venue hire subsidies, assistance to SEPs and assistance to support the transformation of businesses. In addition, MCCY will provide further support for arts and culture self-employed persons (SEPs) affected by the latest tightened measures. We will also subsidise the costs of PET for arts and culture companies presenting permitted live performances from 16 May – 13 June 2021. This will enable larger audiences to attend live performances in this period safely, cushioning the financial impact to arts companies caused by these tightened measures. NAC will release more information on how SEPs and groups presenting live performances can apply for the additional support. Sports SportSG recently announced relief measures for businesses and SEPs affected by the measures announced on 8 May for the period up to 30 May 2021. This includes project grants, operating grants, training assistance grants, and direct cash assistance. This will continue to be available, to help affected businesses defray the costs of overheads. We will extend the support to cover the heightened alert period up to 13 June 2021. SportSG is looking into the provision of more outdoor spaces within its ActiveSG facilities for coaches and instructors to conduct their classes. The mechanism to apply for these spaces will be announced to the community when ready. Details will be communicated by the respective agencies when ready. Keeping our community safe It is critical that our people, businesses, and government work together to bring down the number of COVID-19 cases, to keep our community safe. MCCY understands that the tightened measures are disruptive to our sectors and have developed support packages to help our stakeholders make the necessary adjustments. MCCY very much appreciates our religious organisations, as well as our arts, culture, and sports businesses and communities for rallying together to implement the safe management measures. Together, we will emerge safe, and stronger.

These measures are in response to the community measures introduced on 14 May for Phase 2 (Heightened Alert). It is important that dormitory operators continue to ensure good Safe Living Measures (SLM) are practised in the dormitories. Suspension of Safe Rest Day Visits to Recreation Centres Visits to the Recreation Centres for Safe Rest Days will be suspended temporarily until further notice. We are currently exploring arrangements to allow visits to Recreation Centres in a safe and controlled manner during this Phase of heightened alert and will update in due course. This measure is to mitigate the risk of them being exposed to possible infection and subsequently infecting others in their dormitories. MWs will still be allowed to carry out essential errands, including reporting sick if they are unwell. MWs who are found to have acted irresponsibly may face further actions such as having their work passes revoked. Use of Communal Dormitory Facilities In line with the national measures during this period, all the gyms, beer gardens and communal dining facilities within the dormitories will need to be closed, and canteens can only offer takeaway services (i.e. no dining in).

Approval must be sought from ESG. 8 These play areas refer to the facilities provided free-of-charge in the shops or at the malls’ common areas. 9 More information on SafeEntry and a full list of places where SafeEntry must be deployed can be found at 10 However, all retail establishments and lifestyle-related services must require their employees to do SafeEntry check-in. They must transit to TraceTogether-only SafeEntry when this is implemented from 17 May 2021.Page 4 of 16 8.3.2. From 17 May 2021, TraceTogether-only SafeEntry will be implemented at the above establishments. Refer to Annex A for details on the SafeEntry implementation. 8.3.3. From 15 June 2021, retail establishments required to deploy SafeEntry for customers and visitors will need to provide the SafeEntry Gateway11 (SEGW) as an option for SafeEntry check-in. SEGW is available as a feature within the SafeEntry (Business) App (updated to version 1.1.0 and above) and as a physical standalone device (SEGW Box). These establishments may apply for a free SEGW Box12 . 8.4. Health checks 8.4.1. All malls, large standalone stores, supermarkets and stores providing personal care and beauty services must conduct temperature screening13 , employees must check for visible symptoms14 for customers at entrances, and turn away those with fever and/or who appear unwell15 . 8.5.

Retail establishments should put up clear signages to remind customers to comply with safe management requirements where applicable, and train and deploy service personnel to provide clear communication to customers on SMMs. 10. Refer to Annex B for other recommended guidelines, and Annex C on guidance for specific trades. 11 The SEGW enables contactless detection of both the TraceTogether App and Token, and serves as an additional means of SafeEntry check-in that is quicker and more seamless. It also allows users to check if their Token has run out of battery or is not working. 12 Refer to go.gov.sg/gateway-overview for how to implement the SEGW and apply for a free SEGW Box. 13 Individuals with temperatures above 38 degrees Celsius are considered as having a fever. Supermarkets and stores providing beauty services in malls need not conduct temperature screening and checks on visible symptoms for customers if the mall is already doing so. They should, however, do so if they operate outside the mall hours. 14 Notable visible symptoms to look out for include: (a) coughing; (b) sneezing; (c) breathlessness; and (d) a runny nose. 15 Except where the individual is entering the permitted premises to seek medical treatment for a specific symptom.Page 5 of 16 Safe Management Measures – Workplace premises16 11. To ensure COVID-safe workplaces, retail establishments should take care of their workers, workplaces and those who may become unwell at their workplaces, as outlined in MOM’s Requirements for Safe Management Measures at the Workplace. Enforcement of measures 12. Government agencies will be conducting inspections to check on the proper implementation of the SMMs. Under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act passed in Parliament on 7 April 2020, first-time offenders will face a fine of up to S$10,000, imprisonment of up to six months, or both. For subsequent offences, they may face a fine of up to S$20,000, imprisonment of up to twelve months, or both. 13. Businesses that do not implement or comply with the government’s SMMs may be ineligible for government grants, loans, tax rebates and other assistance, and may also be subject to temporary closures. Annex A – Details of SafeEntry check-in and TraceTogether-only SafeEntry implementation Annex B – Other recommended guidelines for customer-facing operations Annex C – Trade-specific Safe Management Measures for Retail Establishments and Lifestyle-Related Services Issued by: Enterprise Singapore Housing & Development Board Singapore Tourism Board Urban Redevelopment Authority Updated as of 18 May 2021 _________________________________________________________________________ 16 Refers to the retail establishments’ back-of-house operations involving employees, including at offices, warehouses and manufacturing facilities.Page 6 of 16 ANNEX A Details of SafeEntry check-in and TraceTogether-only SafeEntry implementation - Before 17 May 2021, SafeEntry check-in can be done by: i) Scanning of the SafeEntry QR code using a QR code scanner on a smartphone; ii) Using the SingPass App; iii) Using the TraceTogether App; iv) Presenting the TraceTogether Token QR code or ID card to the camera/2D scanner linked to SafeEntry (Business) App for scanning; or v) Bringing the TraceTogether Token or App close to a SEGW. - From 17 May 2021, when TraceTogether-only SafeEntry is implemented at the retail establishments (as listed in paragraph 8.3.1)17, SafeEntry check-in can only be done by: i) Scanning the SafeEntry QR code using the TraceTogether App; ii) Presenting the TraceTogether Token QR code to the camera/2D scanner linked to SafeEntry (Business) App for scanning; or iii) Bringing the TraceTogether Token or App close to a SEGW. - To help ease the transition, scanning of barcodes on ID cards will be retained until 31 May 2021. Following which, ID cards can only be used under extenuating circumstances. For more information, please refer to the FAQs on www.safeentry.gov.sg. - In addition, from 15 June 2021, retail establishments required to deploy SafeEntry for customers and visitors will need to provide the SEGW as an option for SafeEntry check-in. SEGW is available as a feature within the SafeEntry (Business) App (updated to version 1.1.0 and above) and as a physical standalone device (SEGW Box). These establishments may apply for a free SEGW Box18 . - To prepare for the implementation of TraceTogether-only SafeEntry, the above retail establishments should already accept TraceTogether Tokens as a mode of SafeEntry check-in19. Businesses that accept ID cards for check-in will be able to accept Token for check-in if they are already using: i) A smartphone loaded with the SafeEntry (Business) App setup; ii) a laptop and scanner setup if the scanner can scan barcode and QR code; or iii) a SEGW App or SEGW Box. - For avoidance of doubt, TraceTogether Token check-in and SEGW both refer to the mode of check-in, while TraceTogether-only SafeEntry refers to the overall programme which will permit only TraceTogether modes of check-in (i.e. TraceTogether App or Token). - After TraceTogether-only SafeEntry is implemented from 17 May 2021: i) Large retail stores > 930 sqm (or 10,000 sqft) and supermarkets located within a TraceTogether-only SafeEntry building (e.g. malls) that have the same operating hours as the building will no longer be required to deploy SafeEntry check-in for customers, vendors and visitors. Those located within a TraceTogether-only SafeEntry building but with longer operating hours must implement TraceTogether-only SafeEntry outside the building’s operating hours. 17 All retail establishments must require their employees to do SafeEntry check-in using TraceTogether-only SafeEntry when this is implemented from 17 May 2021. 18 Refer to go.gov.sg/gateway-overview for how to implement the SEGW and apply for a free SEGW Box. 19 TraceTogether Token check-in is done by premises scanning the QR codes on the TraceTogether Tokens of customers, vendors and visitors. Refer to to find out how to implement Token check-in mode.Page 7 of 16 ii) Small retail stores (< 930 sqm or 10,000 sqft) that were not required to deploy SafeEntry for customers but have voluntarily done so, should remove their SafeEntry check-ins.Page 8 of 16 ANNEX B Other recommended guidelines for customer-facing operations A. Queue management - Queues should not cause congestion for neighbouring establishments or at other parts of the mall. B. Crowd management - Limit groups of customers entering the store to no more than 2 persons. - Do not hold activities that would attract large crowds inside and outside of the retail establishment (e.g. celebrity appearances, aggressive shopping deals, closed-door members sales). - A standard operating procedure (SOP) should be put in place to manage long queues and large crowds that could form inside or outside stores (e.g. where popular products are displayed) and/or the mall. - Encourage the use of self-checkout, and cashless or contactless payment to reduce contact between employees and customers. - Encourage customers to book appointments, for the viewing and testing of products, as well as for services (e.g. consultation, repairs). - Consider placing frequently purchased goods and necessities near the entrance or checkout to facilitate movement and reduce in-store dwell time. - Operators should take additional steps to manage the capacity within common play areas for children/toddlers/infants (e.g. deploying an employee to man the area), where practicable. C. Health checks - All retail stores not mandated to conduct temperature screening and not located within malls are encouraged to do so and check for visible symptoms where practicable. D. Cleanliness and hygiene - Limit display and testing of products, e.g. stationery, laptops, mobile phones, etc. Employees to conduct product demonstrations if required. Such products should also be sanitised regularly. - Where possible, place hand sanitisers in close proximity of store entrances, high-touch surfaces like door handles, as well as common play areas. Encourage customers to sanitise their hands before entering stores and/or handling products on display. - Supermarkets and other retail establishments which provide trolleys and baskets to their customers are encouraged to provide disinfectant wipes for customers to clean the handles of such trolleys and baskets. - Products that customers touch frequently such as clothes, footwear, jewellery, accessories and optical products, should be cleaned, sanitised or sterilised frequently, where possible. E. Encourage online retail, and “click & collect” for goods and delivery - Encourage online retail and click-and-collect from store, to reduce dwell time - Where practicable, collection and delivery from the store must be spaced out and contactless. - Take reasonable steps to ensure that delivery personnel observe at least one-metre spacing at all times and do not cluster together. Page 9 of 16 - Refer to the Advisory for Delivery Businesses for guidelines on delivery requirements. F. Use of retail establishments as a third-party venue for work-related events - If a retail outlet is used as a third-party event space, as a best practice, only one event should be held in the outlet at a time. If not feasible, each third-party event should be clearly demarcated from the others, as well as from the main consumer shopping area. Each area should be kept completely separate by either a solid partition (at least 1.8- metre high, from wall to wall), or a minimum 3-metre spacing demarcated by continuous physical barriers (e.g. plexiglass screens, barricade tape, queue poles). There should be no mixing or intermingling of guests from separate events. Page 10 of 16 ANNEX C Trade-Specific Safe Management Measures for Retail Establishments The table below contains the trade-specific Safe Management Measures recommended for the customer-facing operations of retail establishments. • Retail establishments are reminded to ensure that their employees and customers wear their masks properly at all times, except when eating or drinking. • The other measures indicated as “MUST” below are also requirements to be implemented, in addition to the measures listed in the main body of the advisory. • The remaining measures should be implemented, where practicable.

Malls must ensure that these individuals consume their meals alone, keep a distance of at least one metre from any other individual and refrain from interacting with anyone. They must also ensure that these individuals wear their masks immediately after eating or drinking. SafeEntry check-in must be deployed at these designated areas. 20 While implementing the necessary SMMs, malls should ensure that the entrance and exit points remain accessible to those with disabilities.Page 11 of 16 Supermarkets, Convenience stores, Mini-marts • Consider providing dedicated shopping hours for vulnerable groups, such as the elderly, persons with disabilities and pregnant women. • Limit groups of customers entering the store to no more than 2 persons.

       " {'text': 'CEA Ref: N13-21 Date: 15 May 2021 By Email To: Key Executive Officers and Real Estate Salespersons Dear Sir / Madam, [NOTICE 13-21] UPDATED ADVISORY ON PROPERTY TRANSACTION ACTIVITIES BY ESTATE AGENTS AND REAL ESTATE SALESPERSONS UNDER PHASE 2 (HEIGHTENED ALERT) IN THE FIGHT AGAINST COVID-19 1. This notice is to update Key Executive Officers (KEOs) and Real Estate Salespersons (RESs) on the new measures to observe from 16 May 2021 through 13 June 2021 (inclusive) to minimise the risk of transmission of COVID-19. Updated advisory 2. On 14 May 2021, the Multi-Ministry Taskforce (MTF) announced that: a. The permissible group size will be further reduced from five to two persons. b. The maximum number of distinct visitors allowed per household per day will similarly be reduced from five to two persons. 3. Both restrictions take effect from 16 May 2021 and will continue until 13 June 2021 (inclusive). Individuals are also strongly encouraged to continue to limit their overall number of social gatherings to not more than two per day, whether to another household, or meeting with friends and family members in a public place. 4. The real estate agency industry must continue to play its part to reduce the spread of COVID-19. The number of locally transmitted COVID-19 cases and unlinked community cases have continued to increase, and the situation could quickly escalate if these cases are not contained swiftly and decisively. Given that the nature of estate agency work may require you to be in various enclosed spaces and in close proximity with different persons and clients, you must be extra vigilant and take all necessary precautions against the spread of COVID-19 in Singapore. 5. With the new announcement, this means that you need to ensure that no more than two distinct persons a day may visit a property inhabited by a household when you conduct estate agency work. The two distinct persons include you and any other person who is visiting the property. You will need to check that your client and the property occupant(s), if the client does not live at the property being visited, are aware of the updated rules, and the number of visitors that may visit the property per day. 6. In addition, in line with the need to act decisively to contain the risk of any spread from undetected cases in the community, you are to defer all door-to-door marketing activities, including flyer distribution to households and business premises, until further notice. 7. Estate Agents (EAs) and RESs are advised to observe this notice and attached updated Guide, which supersedes the previous Notice 10-21 dated 5 May 2021, from 16 May 2021 onwards.8. We seek your continued support and cooperation to protect the health and safety of your employees, RESs, clients and the community. Yours sincerely, KELLY NG DEPUTY DIRECTOR (POLICY & PLANNING) COUNCIL FOR ESTATE AGENCIES Annex – CEA Guide on Property Transaction Activities by EAs and RESs under Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) in the fight against COVID-19 (15 May 2021).As at 15 May 2021 Annex to CEA Notice 13-21 CEA GUIDE ON PROPERTY TRANSACTION ACTIVITIES BY ESTATE AGENTS AND REAL ESTATE SALESPERSONS UNDER PHASE 2 (HEIGHTENED ALERT) IN THE FIGHT AGAINST COVID-19 1. This Guide sets out how estate agents (EAs) and Real Estate Salespersons (RESs) can conduct your operations at your office and your property transaction activities in a safe manner to minimise the risk of transmission of COVID-19. This Guide has been updated following the new heightened measures announced by the Multi-Ministry Taskforce (MTF) on 14 May 2021. 2. In addition to this Guide, you must follow all mandatory requirements and guidance issued by other government ministries and agencies (see Appendix). GENERAL PRINCIPLES 3. The real estate agency industry has an important role to play in reducing the spread of COVID-19 in Singapore. We must remain vigilant in our fight against COVID-19. The following general principles will continue to apply to EAs and RESs: a. Fighting COVID-19 is our collective responsibility: The real estate agency industry shares the responsibility of protecting yourselves and the community you serve to minimise the risk of community transmission. All of us must continue to exercise social responsibility to prevent new cases and clusters from emerging in our industry and community. b. Safe management measures should be an integral part of property transaction activities: As you conduct your operations and property transaction activities, you should continue to adopt a cautious approach and accord priority to protect public health and safety. CORPORATE FUNCTIONS General requirements 4. You are to comply with the Ministry of Manpower’s (MOM) requirements for safe management measures at your office (click here). Work-from-home will be the default at workplaces, and you must ensure that employees who are able to work from home do so. Group or mass activities 5. You are encouraged to use information technology (IT) tools such as video or virtual conferencing platforms, in place of group or mass activities. 6. If a group or mass activity cannot be done virtually, EAs must adopt a cautious approach and reduce the number of people interacting with one another and the duration of the activity. EAs must comply with relevant safe management measures and guidelines for events and activities1 , such as limits on capacity and group sizes. 1 This includes consumer-facing events, such as property launches, roadshows and other marketing events.PROPERTY TRANSACTION ACTIVITIES Standard requirements for on-site property transaction activities 7. You should continue to use IT tools and solutions for your work as much as possible, and only meet your clients in person if it is absolutely necessary for the conduct of the property transaction. If the activity cannot be done virtually, you must take the necessary safe management precautions and record the details of all persons whom you meet. This means that: a. EAs and RESs must adopt the following precautions and ensure that all persons at the activity do the same (hereinafter referred to as “safety precautions”): i. Wear masks2 . ii. Maintain a physical distance of at least one metre between persons. iii. If a person who turns up for the activity is unwell (e.g. exhibits respiratory symptoms and/or has a fever), ask him not to participate in the activity, and to see a doctor. b. If the activity is conducted in premises where safe management measures are not in place (e.g. at a client’s place of residence) or at the transaction property (whether occupied or unoccupied), you must record the entry of your client(s) or any person accompanying you into the premises 2 Face shields should not be used as a substitute for mask wear, except for certain exceptions as permitted by MOH.(hereinafter referred to as “contact tracing requirements”). You may choose to keep the records manually or using other methods3 . c. If you are conducting viewing, handover or takeover activities, you are encouraged to take appropriate measures to reduce contact with surfaces (hereinafter referred to as \"contactless requirements”): i. Encourage all attendees to sanitise their hands. ii. Open doors and windows, and switch on lights in the property so as to minimise your clients touching these during the on-site activity. If the property is occupied, you may wish to request the occupants to do so prior to the activity. iii. Request your clients not to touch surfaces within the premises. You may wear gloves to prepare and facilitate the viewing, handover or takeover with minimum contact of the property by your clients. iv. Do not hand out materials at the meeting (e.g. marketing materials or documents relating to the handover or takeover such as end-of\\x02tenancy checklist, inventory list or property condition report). You should use electronic means to deliver such materials to your clients. 3 EAs and RESs are encouraged to adopt the use of TraceTogether via the TraceTogether token or mobile application for all your estate agency work with your clients and whenever you engage and meet other people in the course of your activities. Listing and marketing properties 8. You are encouraged to market properties using non-physical means (e.g. digital or telephone marketing). The following activities should be deferred until further notice: a. Door-to-door marketing activities (e.g. canvassing from door to door to request owners of unlisted properties if they would like to sell their property). This includes distributing flyers to households and business premises. b. Marketing of properties (including new developments) in public spaces. This includes marketing and distributing flyers at publicly accessible common spaces such as public transport nodes and HDB common areas. 9. If you lease enclosed premises in buildings zoned for retail use such as malls to conduct property transaction activities, you are to comply with the safe management measures for retail establishments that have been set out by Enterprise Singapore, Housing & Development Board (HDB), Singapore Tourism Board and Urban Redevelopment Authority. The measures that apply to all customer-facing operations of retail establishments include safe distancing, crowd management, contact tracing, health checks, cleanliness and hygiene measures. 10. EAs and RESs may enter properties to photograph or film the properties in order to conduct online viewings thereafter, subject to the consent of the seller or landlord. In addition, you must: a. Comply with the safety precautions and contact tracing requirements as stated in paragraph 7(a) and paragraph 7(b) respectively. b. If the property is inhabited by a household, check with your client and the property occupant(s), if the client does not live at the property being visited,to ensure that your visit would not exceed the cap of two distinct visitors (which includes yourself) per household per day, and that your client and the property occupant(s) are aware of this requirement for all visitors. For vacant properties, ensure that no more than two persons visit the property at any one time. Such persons include you and any professional whom you engaged to assist you with preparing the property for listing or virtual viewing (e.g. video production crew). c. Minimise the amount of time spent in the property. d. Minimise interactions with the occupants if the property is occupied. Meeting your client 11. You are encouraged to continue using IT tools in place of face-to-face interaction, such as video or virtual conferencing platforms to meet with your client. 12. If the meeting cannot be done virtually (e.g. to sign property transaction documents that require “wet-ink” signatures), you should do so in premises where safe management measures are in place, such as the EA’s office. You should reduce the number of persons attending the meeting to the minimum extent possible. 13. If you meet your client at his place of residence or at the transaction property, you must: a. Comply with the safety precautions and contact tracing requirements as stated in paragraph 7(a) and paragraph 7(b) respectively. b. If the property is inhabited by a household, check with your client and the property occupant(s), if the client does not live at the property being visited, to ensure that your visit would not exceed the cap of two distinct visitors (which includes yourself) per household per day, and that your client and the property occupant(s) are aware of this requirement for all visitors. For vacant properties, ensure that no more than two persons visit the property at any one time. Such persons include you and any other person who is visiting the property. c. Minimise the time spent with the client. Conducting viewings 14. You are encouraged to arrange for virtual viewings first before doing viewings in person to reduce the number of viewings that your client will need to decide on the property. 15. Open houses are still not allowed as these may attract large groups of people congregating at the property. 16. When conducting physical viewings, you are to: a. Comply with the safety precautions and contact tracing requirements, and are encouraged to adopt contactless measures as stated in paragraph 7(a), paragraph 7(b) and paragraph 7(c) respectively. b. Arrange for all viewings to be done on an appointment basis only, with the start and end times clearly stated and known to the attendees of the viewing. Keep viewings short and end by the scheduled end time. You must not schedule back-to-back viewings for vacant properties. There should be a time gap between appointments to prevent gatherings or physical interactions with other persons from taking place in or near the property.c. If the property is inhabited by a household, check with your client and the property occupant(s), if the client does not live at the property being visited, to ensure that your visit would not exceed the cap of two distinct visitors (which includes yourself) per household per day, and that your client and the property occupant(s) are aware of this requirement for all visitors. For vacant properties, ensure that no more than two distinct persons visit the property at any one time. Such persons include you and any other person who is visiting the property. 17. Where advisories have been issued by relevant authorities (e.g. by the Urban Redevelopment Authority) in relation to clients’ business activities, EAs and RESs should adhere to these advisories and advise their clients accordingly. Signing and delivering estate agency agreement and property transaction documents 18. You should continue to use IT tools and solutions as much as possible, and only meet your client in person if it is absolutely necessary for the conduct of the property transaction. This means that you should: a. Use electronic means to deliver and receive the documents from your client. b. Arrange for a phone, video or virtual meeting to go through and explain the clauses in the documents to your client. You must give your client sufficient time to read and understand the meaning and consequences of the provisions in the documents. c. Use electronic signatures in place of “wet-ink” signatures for signing of the estate agency agreement. d. If you meet the client at a property that is inhabited by a household, ensure that your visit would not exceed the cap of two distinct visitors (which includes yourself) per household per day. 19. Different organisations such as banks and the transacting parties may have their own policies or preferences on the use of electronic signatures. Contracting parties may consider the use of secure electronic signatures for property transactions for greater assurance, such as “Sign with SingPass”, which allows SingPass users to use the SingPass mobile application to digitally sign an electronic document. You should seek advice from appropriate professionals such as lawyers if you or your client have any doubt in relation to the use of electronic signatures for these documents. 20. Please note that HDB currently does not allow the exercise of option to be done remotely or electronically. Forms prescribed by HDB, such as its Option to Purchase form, require “wet-ink” signatures. Handing or taking over rental properties 21. You may assist to facilitate the handover or takeover of rental properties. However, you should first arrange for virtual meetings to discuss handover or takeover matters. 22. When meeting, you should keep interactions short and adhere strictly to the group size cap and/or daily visitor cap. In addition, you must comply with the safety precautions and contact tracing requirements, and are encouraged to adopt contactless measures as stated in paragraph 7(a), paragraph 7(b) and paragraph 7(c) respectively.CONCLUSION 23. Where mandatory requirements and guidance by other government ministries and agencies have been issued, you should adhere to them and advise your client accordingly. These authorities include Ministry of Health, Ministry of Manpower, Ministry of Trade and Industry, Building and Construction Authority, Enterprise Singapore, Housing & Development Board, Singapore Tourism Board, Urban Redevelopment Authority, and Singapore Land Authority. You may refer to the resource reference at the Appendix. 24. The heightened measures that are imposed from 16 May 2021 to 13 June 2021 under Phase 2 (Heightened Alert), are necessary to curb the COVID-19 infections in Singapore. We seek your continued support and cooperation to remain vigilant and adhere to the safe management measures to protect the health and safety of your employees, RESs, clients and the community.Appendix of Annex to CEA Notice 13-21 LIST OF KEY GOVERNMENT MINISTRIES AND AGENCIES WITH GUIDANCE AND ADVISORIES RELEVANT TO THE REAL ESTATE AGENCY INDUSTRY [CEA] COVID-19 [MOH] [MTI] GoBusiness sg/ [MOM] Safe management measures at the workplace d-19/requirements-for-safe\\x02management-measures [ESG, HDB, STB and URA] Safe Management Measures: Retail Establishments and lifestyle\\x02related services esg.gov.sg/covid\\x0219/safe-distance [BCA] Built Environment Sector COVID-19 Information D-19 [HDB] web/homepage [URA] orate [SLA]', 'id': 'b706e1b2-ea56-4191-bacf-c11233ecd40c', 'score': None, 'probability': None, 'question': None, 'meta': {'category': 'advisories'}, 'embedding': None},\n",
       " {'text': 'UPDATES ON LOCAL SITUATION AND HEIGHTENED ALERT TO MINIMISE TRANSMISSION 14TH MAY 2021 The Multi-Ministry Taskforce (MTF) has been closely monitoring the local and global COVID-19 situation. The number of locally transmitted COVID-19 cases and unlinked community cases has continued to increase. This is concerning as the situation could quickly escalate if these cases are not contained swiftly and decisively. Update on Local Situation 2. We have detected several clusters of infections emerging in the past 2 weeks around (i) an ICA officer and his extended family, (ii) Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH), (iii) Tuas South Community Care Facility, and (iv) Pasir Panjang Terminal. Most recently, we have an emerging cluster at Changi Airport Terminal 3 with a total of 46 cases to date. 3. To reduce the risk of any spread from undetected cases in the community, we have cast a wide net and taken swift action to detect, isolate, and ringfence any possible emerging transmissions to the community. We have carried out mass surveillance testing of persons with possible exposure to cases surrounding these clusters, such as TTSH patients and visitors who were at TTSH during the infectious period. Special testing operations have also been conducted to test port workers who had been deployed at Pasir Panjang Terminal, as well as workers at Changi Airport Terminals 1 and 3 and Jewel Changi Airport. Since 1 May 2021, we have also implemented additional pre-emptive measures to minimise interactions at both social settings and workplaces so as to break the chains of transmission to the community. These measures were further enhanced with effect from 8 May 2021, with reductions in the prevailing group size of social gatherings and the size of larger scale events or activities, to minimise the likelihood of large clusters forming. 4. However, a pattern of local unlinked community cases has emerged and is persisting. This is worrying as it suggests that there may be unknown cases in the community with possible ongoing community transmission and that our earlier and ongoing measures to break the chains of transmissions may be insufficient. We need to act decisively to contain these risks as any one leak could result in an uncontrolled resurgence of cases. Hence we will move to impose targeted restrictions on higher risk settings such as those where there is a high density of people who are unmasked for prolonged periods. Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) in the Fight Against COVID-19 5. Following the measures introduced on 8 May 2021, we need to tighten more measures to decisively arrest the increasing number of cases in the community. The following measures will take effect from Sunday 16 May 2021 through Sunday 13 June 2021. A) Further reductions in permissible group size 6. We will further reduce the current permissible group size of up to 5 persons to up to 2 persons, and the cap of 5 distinct visitors per household per day to 2 distinct visitors per household per day. Individuals should continue to limit their overall number of social gatherings to not more than 2 per day, whether to another household, or meeting with friends and family members in a public place. 7. In order to allow families’ current childcare arrangements to continue, grandchildren being cared for by their grandparents on a daily basis would not be counted towards the cap of 2 distinct visitors per household, or to the number of social gatherings per day. However grandparents are strongly encouraged to be vaccinated against COVID-19, to protect both themselves and their grandchildren from COVID-19 infection. To reduce the risk of transmission, grandparents should also minimise intermingling between grandchildren from different households. B) Minimising Workplace Interactions 8. Work-from-home will be the default at workplaces. Employers must ensure that employees who are able to work from home do so. There should continue to be no cross-deployment of workers to multiple worksites. Employers should continue to stagger start times of employees who need to return to the workplace and implement flexible working hours. Social gatherings at the workplace will not be allowed. Employees may have meal breaks at the workplace, but refrain from intermingling with their colleagues when their masks are taken off. These measures will lower transmission risks by reducing overall footfall and interactions at common spaces at or near the workplace, and in public places, including public transport. C) Cessation of Indoor “Mask-Off” Activities 9. The recent clusters have demonstrated higher attack rates and secondary transmission occur in mask-off settings, households, and at eateries. To reduce risks of community transmission, indoor “mask-off” activities such as dine-in F&B establishments will cease during this period. Other activities which will also not be allowed during this period include strenuous indoor exercise class or strenuous individual and group indoor sports and exercise activities. In addition, personalised services which require masks to be removed (e.g. facials and saunas), singing, and the playing of instruments that require intentional expulsion of air (e.g. wind or brass instruments) will also not be allowed. These restrictions will not apply to medical and dental consultations that require patients to have their masks off. Please see details in following paragraphs and in Annex A. 10. Cessation of Dine-in Food and Beverage (F&B). Dine-in F&B establishments are a higher-risk setting as customers often dine for prolonged periods in close proximity with one another with their masks-off. To reduce the risk of community transmission, dine-in F&B establishments (including hawker centres and foodcourts), both indoor and outdoor, will only be able to offer takeaway and delivery options. 11. Reduction of Activity and Event Sizes and Pre-Event Testing Requirements. To minimise the likelihood of large cluster formations, we will further scale down event sizes and lower the event size caps. Pre-event testing (PET) remains an essential measure to help ensure that events can proceed safely for attendees. More details on PET can be found on the MOH website. a. Congregational and other worship services. Congregational and other worship services may continue with a reduced capacity of 50 attendees at any one time without PET, or up to 100 attendees at any one time with PET implemented. To further mitigate the risk of spread through aerosol transmissions, religious workers and all other participants must wear their masks at all times. Live singing and playing of wind instruments will also be suspended during this period. b. Shopping malls and showrooms. The occupancy limits for shopping malls and showrooms will be further reduced from the current limit of 10sqm per person of Gross Floor Area (GFA), to 16sqm per person. Odd and even date entry restrictions on Sundays for popular malls will continue. c. Attractions and shows. The operating capacity of attractions that have received MTI’s prior approval will be reduced to 25% from the current permissible capacity of 50%. Indoor and outdoor shows may proceed with up to 100 persons with PET, and up to 50 persons without PET. d. Museums and public libraries. Museums and public libraries will be allowed to operate at a reduced capacity of 25%. e. Cinemas. Up to 100 persons may be allowed into cinema halls with PET implemented. Without PET, only up to 50 persons may be allowed. The prevailing group size of 2 persons applies, and food and beverages may not be sold or consumed in the cinema. f. MICE and live performances. Up to 100 persons may be allowed with PET, and up to 50 persons may be allowed without PET. Unmasking is not allowed for speakers and performers, and there should be no singing or playing of instruments that require intentional expulsion of air (e.g. wind and brass instruments). g. Wedding receptions and solemnisations. - In line with measures on dine-in F&B establishments, wedding receptions will not be allowed. - Marriage solemnisations may continue for up to 100 participants with PET and 50 participants without PET. h. Funerals. The cap for attendees applicable to all days of the funeral, including the burial/ cremation, is 20 persons or less, down from 30 persons currently. Attendees are reminded to maintain safe distancing and keep masks on at all times to reduce the risk of transmission. Targeted Support Measures A) Enhanced Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) Support for F&B Firms 12. In view of the cessation of dining-in at F&B establishments, the Government will increase the JSS support rate to 50% of the first $4,600 of gross monthly wages paid to local employees during the period for which dining-in is prohibited. This is an increase from the 10% support for wages paid up to June 2021. B) One-Month Rental Relief for Hawker Centres and Coffeeshops on Government-owned Premises 13. To support hawkers and coffeeshop stallholders, who are self-employed and do not benefit from the JSS, the Government will provide one month of rental waiver for hawker stall and coffeeshop tenants of Government agencies. Commercial landlords are urged to support their F&B tenants through this period. Use of Face Shields 14. Research has demonstrated that face shields cannot substitute masks in protecting the wearer from droplet infection. More importantly, face shields do not adequately prevent droplet spread if the wearer is infected. Face shields should therefore not be used as a substitute for mask wear, except for medical exceptions; or where the child is 12 years or younger; or for the marriage couple during the solemnisation of their marriage. Expansion of Testing Strategy 15. The above measures will continue to be complemented by our testing, contact tracing, and vaccination capabilities, that we have built up over the past year to manage community spread. Testing, in particular, is one of our key defensive tools to quickly identify individuals who have been exposed to the virus and reduce chances of further spread. Active surveillance and routine testing of targeted groups, such as those with higher risk of exposure to COVID-19, and testing for those diagnosed with Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI) with a COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test has enabled quick detection of unlinked cases in the community. For swifter detection of possible cases, we will be also begin Antigen Rapid Testing (ART) for all who present themselves with ARI symptoms at our Swab and Send Home (SASH) Public Health Preparedness Clinics (PHPCs), Polyclinics, Emergency Departments and Regional Swab Centres (RSCs). This ART will be done together with the PCR test that all such patients are already subjected to. Both the ART and PCR tests will be funded by the Government for all individuals with ARI symptoms. While the ART is less accurate than the PCR test, and there will be more false positives and false negatives, the ART’s quicker turnaround time compared to a PCR test1 will allow us to take any public health actions more quickly for persons who test positive by ART. 16. This enhanced testing regime will be rolled out progressively, starting with around 200 SASH PHPCs that are already licensed as ART providers from 15 May 2021, and will be expanded to include all SASH PHPCs through May alongside Polyclinics, Emergency Departments in hospitals, and RSCs. Along with our use of digital tools, such as the TraceTogether and SafeEntry programme, these measures will enable us to quickly identify and draw wide rings around cases and their close contacts. Keeping our Vulnerable and Community Safe 17. Vaccination remains critical in our fight against the pandemic. We have continued to make steady progress with our vaccination programme, having started with our most vulnerable, such as healthcare workers, elderly, and workers with high risks of exposure to COVID-19. As of 13 May 2021, we have administered more than 3.2 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine. About 1.9 million individuals have received at least one dose of the vaccine, of whom about 1.3 million individuals have received their second dose and completed the full vaccination regimen. 18. The recent cases illustrate that vaccination may not eliminate the risks of infection completely. However it provides significant protection against infections and helps to reduce the severity of the disease and onward transmission. Vaccination thus remains a key enabler and its ability to help us re-open safely can only be felt when we achieve a high level of population coverage for vaccination. Hence, we urge everyone to be vaccinated when it is offered to you. Observe all safe management measures, see a doctor, and get tested if you feel unwell. It is only together, that we can emerge stronger and safer.

       " {'text': 'Updated guidelines for volunteer management during COVID-19 pandemic Note: This supersedes the earlier Guidelines for Volunteer Management during COVID-19 Pandemic, dated 7 May 2021. 17 May 2021 On 14 May 2021, the Multi-Ministry Taskforce (MTF) announced the need to tighten the measures introduced on 8 May 2021 to decisively arrest the increasing number of cases in the community. These measures will take effect from 16 May to 13 June 20211. This document provides guidance to individuals and organisations on their volunteering activities in Phase Two (Heightened Alert). Approach for Phase Two (Heightened Alert) Volunteers continue to play a key role in the fight against COVID-19. Their activities include promoting social responsibility, supporting essential services and caring for the vulnerable segments. In Phase Two (Heightened Alert), Volunteer Host Organisations (VHOs)2 can continue to enlist volunteers to support essential aid distribution (i.e. supplies necessary for daily sustenance e.g. cooked food and food rations, and urgent financial aid). With the tightening measures, volunteering associated with non-essential services will be suspended. For new activities involving essential aid distribution, VHOs should plan the modality to adhere with the prevailing safe management measures and submit to National Council of Social Service (NCSS) the following information of the activities via www.go.gov.sg/distributioncontact at least 3 working days before VHOs commence activities3. a) Name of VHO b) Person-in-charge and contact details c) List of staff and volunteers d) Number of beneficiaries served e) Type of essential aid (e.g. cooked meals, personal care products, vouchers) f) Modality and frequency of essential aid distribution g) Number of staff/ volunteers needed to distribute essential aid Apart from essential aid distribution, VHOs can also respond to other community needs so long as these activities adhere to safe management measures and guidelines for the specific sector4. Plans on essential aid distribution should also be submitted to NCSS. VHOs can conduct volunteer activities in groups of two persons with no inter-mingling between groups, and in accordance with safe management measures and sector guidelines. VHOs should also collaborate and coordinate with partners to minimise duplicative efforts, and reduce the movement of staff and volunteers and physical interactions. Avoid general outreach and door-to-door visitation, except for cases in need of urgent aid5. Notwithstanding the above, VHOs are strongly encouraged to carry out their volunteering activities remotely or in virtual format wherever possible, e.g. via telephone and video-conference. This is still the best way to keep our volunteers and beneficiaries safe. See Table 1 for a summary of the approach for volunteering activities. Table 1: Summary of the approach for volunteering activities Volunteering Activities Approach a. Volunteering activities supporting essential aid distribution Inform NCSS via this link www.go.gov.sg/distributioncontact, and adhere to safe management measures b. Volunteering activities to support other essential community needs Conduct volunteer activities, involving groups of up to any two persons, with no inter-mingling across groups, and adhere to safe management measures Assess risk and apply safe management measures VHOs must conduct volunteer activity risk assessment to assess the format for the activity and deployment of volunteers (See Annex A for an illustration). Should face-to-face interactions be necessary for volunteering activities, VHOs must ensure compliance with safe management measures. These measures include: a. As a default, measures should be put in place to ensure that individuals maintain safe distancing of at least one metre at all times; b. Where not feasible or practical to apply one metre safe distancing between individuals, this one metre requirement should be enforced between groups, with each group made up of no more than two persons, and with no mixing between groups. c. Ensure no cross deployment or social mixing among different groups of volunteers and schedule their volunteer activities, if possible, in fixed teams, to minimise interactions between volunteers and staff. d. Ensure staff and volunteers wear a mask at all times. Staff and volunteers should not participate if unwell. e. Encourage staff and volunteers to observe good personal hygiene, e.g. wash their hands regularly and refrain from touching their face. f. Avoid involving children, persons with chronic or underlying conditions, and pregnant women as volunteers. However, these individuals can take on virtual volunteer roles that allow them to operate from home. g. Limit the number and physical movement of staff and volunteers involved to minimise the risk of transmission. Implement staggered working and break hours and timings of volunteering sessions to reduce possible congregation at common spaces. Keep a register and track movement using a movement log, in order to facilitate contact tracing, if necessary. h. Reduce frequency and duration of physical interactions with beneficiaries, e.g. consolidate essential aid to be delivered to reduce the number of physical trips and avoid physical interactions by leaving supplies at the door. If there is a need to check on the beneficiaries, volunteers to maintain at least 1m safe distance. For beneficiaries who are seniors, deliver essential aid to their doorstep as far as possible, so that they do not have to venture out to do collection. i. Where it is not feasible to arrange for delivery, designated collection points can also be set up in the vicinity for beneficiaries to collect the essential aid with the necessary precautionary measures to ensure safe management. Buffet set-ups are strictly prohibited. Volunteers must not congregate and should minimise physical interaction with beneficiaries. j. Enable contact tracing to be carried out quickly and effectively by using the SafeEntry or TraceTogether-only SafeEntry system to log the check-in and check-out of staff and volunteers from premises. VHOs should ensure that they are ready to implement TraceTogether-only SafeEntry from 17 May 2021. This is a free-for-use service. Visit to sign up for SafeEntry NRIC or SafeEntry QR or for TraceTogether-only SafeEntry, and to refer to the user guidelines and FAQs. Upon registration, an onboarding guide with links to all the key resources, digital posters, step-by-step user guides and demo videos will be provided. k. Require staff and volunteers to download and activate the TraceTogether app. This will help MOH to more quickly identify potential close contacts of COVID-19 patients and reduce disease transmission. Data recorded by TraceTogether is stored on the user’s phone, and is only uploaded when required by MOH, e.g. when the user is suspected to have COVID-19. More information on TraceTogether can be found at Ensure safety and well-being of volunteers VHOs must continue to ensure the safety and well-being of their volunteers. The volunteers should be informed about the risks, and the measures taken by the VHO to protect them. This can include a briefing on the volunteer activity and precautionary measures, and shall be conducted remotely online, where possible. VHOs are to provide a contact number for volunteers to call in case of emergency or if they feel distressed. VHOs shall also actively seek feedback from volunteers and help to address their concerns, if any. Even with safe management measures and gradual resumption of activities, there is a risk that COVID-19 transmission may happen. VHOs must be prepared to help volunteers who have contracted COVID-19 in the line of duty. This can include helping them to apply for relief under The Courage Fund6, and to extend support for their families during this period of time. VHOs should also provide emotional support to any volunteer who needs it, and can tap on the National Care hotline. VHOs should also find ways to show their appreciation for their volunteers’ efforts, which can include sharing positive stories through the SG Cares App, providing words of encouragement, and tokens of appreciation. Sustain engagement of supporters and volunteers VHOs are strongly encouraged to continue to communicate and engage their supporters and volunteers during this period even if they are not deployed. This will allow VHOs to activate volunteer resources quickly when the situation improves. Activities by VHOs can include doing the following remotely: a. Keep supporters informed of the current happenings and initiatives; b. Share stories to motivate volunteers to step up; c. Encourage creative and safe ways to volunteer, both remotely and on-site; d. Build online communities and social networks; and e. Leverage online volunteer opportunities portals, communication tools and learning resources (See Annex B for a list of resources). These measures will be revised in tandem with future adjustments in MOH’s guidelines. Depending on the risk assessment and our safe management practices, MCCY will issue further advisories to guide VHOs on the management and deployment of volunteers. We need to remain cautious and stay safe as long as the risk of COVID-19 transmission remains. Working together to emerge stronger The community and volunteers shape a caring and united Singapore. With everyone playing their part and supporting each other, we can overcome this pandemic and emerge stronger. For enquiries For clarifications or enquiries, VHOs can write in to SGCares@mccy.gov.sg.

       " {'text': 'J OINT ADVISORY Page 1 of 4 MR No.: 034/21 Updated Safe Management Measures For Food & Beverage and Online Retail Delivery 1. The Multi-Ministry Taskforce (MTF) announced on 14 May 2021 that safe management measures will be further tightened to reduce the risk of community spread, with effect from 16 May through 13 June 2021. During this period, all Food & Beverage (F&B) establishments can only operate for takeaway and/or delivery. Dining-in is not permitted. In addition, online retail is encouraged for retail establishments to minimise in-store dwell time. These measures are to reduce physical interactions and risk of transmission within the community. 2. In line with this, Enterprise Singapore (ESG) and the Land Transport Authority (LTA) are providing operational guidance on safe management measures for businesses providing delivery services for F&B and retail establishments. This includes in-house delivery operations, third-party delivery businesses, as well as taxis and private-hire cars (PHCs)1 , which can continue to make grocery and food deliveries. All such delivery personnel must comply with these measures. The information in this document supersedes that in previous advisories or statements. Food Delivery 3. Companies providing food delivery services must comply with the following: 3.1. For delivery personnel 3.1.1. Wear masks at all times during their work. 3.1.2. Minimise contact and interactions with others at all times and not cluster together when waiting to collect food items or during breaks (not more than 2 persons in a group). This includes interactions with employees from F&B establishments, customers and other delivery personnel. 3.1.3. Comply with the one-metre distancing measure with other individuals, including other delivery personnel. If an F&B outlet is overcrowded, they should wait outside the establishment, maintain a safe distance from other delivery personnel or customers, and only enter the outlet when food is ready for collection. 3.2. For F&B establishments 3.2.1. Opt for contactless pick-up, where food orders are placed by the F&B establishment at designated locations for pick-up by delivery personnel. 1 In March 2020, LTA announced a temporary liberalisation of regulations to allow the use of taxis and PHCs for grocery and food deliveries. This arrangement will continue to be in place until end September 2021.Page 2 of 4 3.3. For customers 3.3.1. Opt for contactless receiving of food, where food orders are left by delivery personnel at designated locations (e.g. at the doorstep) for pick\\x02up by customers. Online Retail Delivery 4. Businesses providing online retail delivery services must comply with the following: 4.1. For delivery personnel 4.1.1. Wear masks at all times during their work. 4.1.2. Minimise contact and interactions with others at all times and not cluster together when waiting to collect items or during breaks (not more than 2 persons in a group). This includes interactions with employees from retail establishments, customers and other delivery personnel. 4.1.3. Comply with the one-metre distancing measure. They should only enter the retail establishment when the retail item is ready for collection. 4.1.4. Leave the premises as soon as bulk items have been put in place. 4.2. For retail establishments 4.2.1. Opt for contactless pick-up, where items are placed at designated locations for pick-up by delivery personnel. 4.2.2. For on-site installation, employees responsible for delivery and installation must comply with stringent hygiene and safe management measures, and leave the premises once installation is completed. The number of employees involved in the installation should be kept to no more than 2 workers. 4.3. For consumers 4.3.1. Opt for contactless receiving of items, where items are left by delivery personnel at designated locations (e.g. at the doorstep) for pick-up by customers. Contact Tracing 5. Delivery personnel are encouraged to download the TraceTogether mobile app or use a TraceTogether Token2 to facilitate contact tracing; this will help protect themselves and the community. 6. When entering establishments for collection of items, they must do their SafeEntry check-in (via TraceTogether-only SafeEntry) and temperature screening where required. 6.1. The following retail establishments are required to deploy SafeEntry: • Malls and large standalone stores; • Large retail stores > 930 sqm or 10,000 sqft; • Supermarkets; • Personal care services e.g. hairdressers, barbers, spas, beauty and wellness; and • Facilities providing basic pet services (that do not function on a drop-off, pick\\x02up basis). 2 For those using the TraceTogether Token, they are reminded to check the battery level. A green blinking light indicates that the Token is functioning properly whereas a red blinking light indicates that the battery is low. Page 3 of 4 6.2. Note that i) large retail stores > 930 sqm (or 10,000 sqft) and ii) supermarkets located within a TraceTogether-only SafeEntry building (e.g. malls) that have the same operating hours as the building are not required to deploy SafeEntry check\\x02in for customers, vendors and visitors (including delivery personnel). However, those located within a TraceTogether-only SafeEntry building but with longer operating hours must implement TraceTogether-only SafeEntry outside the building’s operating hours. 6.3. As per current practice, it is not necessary for delivery personnel to do SafeEntry check-in at F&B establishments. Cleanliness and hygiene measures 7. All delivery businesses must comply with the following: 7.1. Carry out daily temperature screening and health declaration among employees, including delivery personnel before they start work. Those who are unwell cannot work and must go to the doctor. 7.2. Ensure adoption of cleanliness and hygiene practices and compliance with MOH health advisories. 7.3. Delivery personnel who are eating or drinking in the course of their work must wear their masks immediately after doing so. They should dine alone, keep a distance of at least one metre from any other individual and refrain from interacting with other individuals. 7.4. Equip delivery personnel with hand sanitisers. Personnel must be reminded to wash their hands with soap and water regularly. In the event that they are unable to do so in between deliveries, they should keep their hands clean by using the hand sanitisers. 7.5. Delivery personnel must frequently clean carriers such as food carriers, food bags and food warmers for food delivery, and other forms of carriers and boxes for retail delivery. The frequency of cleaning and disinfection should be commensurate with increased usage. 7.6. Delivery personnel should not place their personal items (e.g. water bottles) in the same box, carrier, or insulated container, which are used to hold food ordered by customers. 7.7. Businesses can refer to NEA’s guidelines of Interim List of Household Products and Active Ingredients for Disinfection of the COVID-19 Virus for information3 . Businesses will need to ensure appropriate use of disinfectants and ensure they do not come into contact with food. 8. Employers, employees and delivery personnel must exercise social responsibility by observing good personal hygiene and monitoring their health conditions. Employees and delivery personnel must reduce physical interactions and not have meals in groups. Those who are unwell, even with mild flu-like symptoms, must see a doctor and stay at home to prevent spreading illness to others. Communications 9. All companies providing delivery services must provide clear communications and reminders to delivery personnel to ensure compliance with the above safe management and baseline sanitation and hygiene measures. 3 4 of 4 Enforcement of measures 10. Government agencies will be stepping up enforcement of these safe management measures. Under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act passed in Parliament on 7 April 2020, first-time offenders will face a fine of up to S$10,000, imprisonment of up to six months, or both. Subsequent offences may face a fine of up to S$20,000, imprisonment of up to twelve months, or both. 11. Businesses that do not implement or comply with the government’s safe management advisories may also be ineligible for government grants, loans, tax rebates and other assistance.

Visits to residential care homes [Updated 18 Jun 2021]Physical visits to residential care homes serving elderly (“Homes”) will resume from 21 June 2021. Visitors will need to take a FET – via ARTs – at the Home and test negative prior to entry. Some Homes may require more time to put in place the necessary procedures for ART, and will only be able to resume visits at a later date, while others may start with a smaller number of visitors. Visitors should continue to schedule visits ahead of time, and take into consideration the added time required to complete the ART. Targeted support measures [Updated 18 Jun 2021]In view of the continued tightened safe management measures until mid-July 2021, the Government will extend the current enhancements to the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) for affected sectors by 3 weeks, before tapering it down to 10% for another 2 weeks.Please refer to this table for details: Sectors with JSS enhancement JSS Support for Stage 1 of Phase 3 (Heightened Alert) 14 June – 20 June Proposed new JSS Support Next 3 weeks (starting 21 June) 2 weeks after (starting 12 July) Closed sectors or sectors with enhanced safe management measures Food and Beverage (F&B) Gyms and fitness studios Performing Arts & Arts Education 50% 50% 10% Significantly affected sectors Retail Cinemas Museums, art galleries, historical sites Family entertainment 30% 30% *As announced earlier, affected personal care services will receive 30% enhanced JSS until 20 Jun and 10% from 21 Jun to 30 Jun For hawkers who are self-employed, the Government will extend subsidies for fees for table-cleaning and centralised dishwashing services, and provide rental waivers, till mid-July 2021, for stallholders in centres managed by NEA or NEA-appointed operators.The Government will also extend the COVID-19 Recovery Grant (Temporary) [CRG-T] until 31 July 2021. Existing CRG-T recipients who continue to require assistance can also apply for a second tranche of CRG-T support in July. For taxi and private hire car drivers, the Government will extend the COVID-19 Driver Relief Fund for 3 more months at $300 per month per vehicle for two months, and $150 per month per vehicle for the next one month. Deployment of SafeEntry Gateway Check-Out Boxes [Updated 18 Jun 2021]To facilitate SafeEntry (SE) check-outs, SafeEntry Gateway (SEGW) Check-Out Boxes will be rolled out progressively at venues with high footfall (e.g. malls, hospitals and polyclinics), and places where individuals are likely to be in close proximity for prolonged periods with masks off (e.g. dine-in F&B outlets and gyms).Members of the public are encouraged to perform SE check-outs when leaving the premises as far as possible. This will help to facilitate more precise contact tracing efforts. Sale of Antigen Rapid Test (ART) self-test kit at retail pharmaciesThe Health Sciences Authority (HSA) has granted interim authorisation for 4 ART self-test kits for sale to the general public at pharmacists from 16 June 2021:•Abbott PanBioTM COVID-19 Antigen Self-test•QuickVue At-Home OTC COVID-19 Test•SD Biosensor SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Self-Test Nasal•SD Biosensor Standard Q COVID-19 Ag Home TestIndividuals who have a positive result for their ART self-test should immediately approach a Swab and Send Home Public Health Preparedness Clinic (SASH PHPC) for a confirmatory Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test. They are then required to self-isolate until they receive a negative PCR test result. Those who test negative on their self-test ART should continue to stay vigilant, and adhere to prevailing safe management measures. Individuals who have acute respiratory infection (ARI) symptoms should continue to visit a doctor for a full diagnosis and PCR test, instead of relying on an ART self-test kit.For more information, click here for MOH's press release.\", 'id': '35f405cd-5811-4a10-8405-f8920adb429d', 'score': None, 'probability': None, 'question': None, 'meta': {'category': 'articles'}, 'embedding': None},\n",
       " {'text': 'where tech and finance meet Chatbot Coach, UX/UI Designer Robotics Process Designer, Cloud Specialist, Machine Learning Architect. These may sound like Information Technology (IT)jobs, but they are actually roles that exist in the financial services sector. In the past few years, financial institutions have digital upskilling a key priority. Just ask the Talent Acquisition Head at DBS Bank, Ms Susan Cheong.“With COVID-19 accelerating digital disruption and changing the way we live, we are ramping up our upskilling efforts to stay ahead of these massive changes,” she says. From this year, DBS has identified over 7,200 employees to be upskilled or reskilled, in emerging areas such as design thinking, artificial intelligence and machine learning.Head of Group Human Resources at UOB, Mr Dean Tong, says that technology is core to the Bank’s innovation and transformation drive. “By deepening digital knowledge and skills, we ensure that our workforce is ever ready to harness the future of technology,” he says. This push towards digitalisation has opened up opportunities in financial services for many Singaporeans, such as 33-year-old Muhammad Helmy Bin Razali. Having previously been in the security sector for 10 years, he made the switch to the Financial Services sector, and is currently a Cyber Threat Monitoring Specialist at Deutsche Bank. “Speaking to computers”To pursue his goal of having a career in tech, Helmy decided to move into cybersecurity through the Technology in Finance Immersion Programme (TFIP) in October 2019. Covering cybersecurity as well as banking and finance during the four-month course proved to be a challenging experience – in more ways than one. “There were frequent tests during the course. Having to take in all that knowledge and present my understanding on the topics was quite a hurdle,” Helmy recalls. Fortunately, he wasn’t alone. “Fellow trainees in TFIP were an awesome bunch, and we pulled through the course together.” Upon completing the course, Helmy began his on-the-job training at Deutsche Bank. Helmy was first tasked with developing his “cyber instincts.” Having excelled during his training, Helmy was subsequently hired on a full-time basis as a Cyber Threat Monitoring Specialist in November 2020.When asked what the biggest change has been since moving to Deutsche Bank, Helmy remarks that the way he communicates at work now is completely different. In his previous job, Helmy had face-to-face interactions with staff, security officers and visitors within the airport and hospital. Launched in 2019, the TFIP aims to help mid-career individuals start a tech career in the Financial Services sector. Jointly developed by The Institute of Banking & Finance (IBF) and Workforce Singapore (WSG), in consultation with Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) and Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), successful applicants will undergo structured training and attachment with participating financial institutions. Specialist tracks are doubled this year, including UX Design, Digital Marketing, Software Engineering, Business Analysis, Technology Product Management and Agile IT Project Management. Applications for the TFIP 2021 intake will be opened soon and interested applicants can find out more here. From NS hobby to full time career Another individual who made full use of his traineeship opportunity is Ivan Goh, a Technology Analyst at the UOB. The 24 year-old is currently in the midst of his 12-month SGUnited traineeship and will be converted to a full time position in July this year. Ivan’s interest in tech took off during his time undergoing National Service (NS). “During NS, I became quite interested in coding. During free time in-between training, I would read more on different coding languages,” he recalls. Putting his coding skills to the test, the graduate from NTU’s Business Administration progressed to creating a website for Singapore’s first “ground up” hackathon - Innovation Fest in 2018, organised by Leng Kee Community Club. Participants at the hackathon developed business plans and prototypes to address social issues faced by the elderly, persons with disabilities and families in crisis. Buoyed by his technical experience at Innovation Fest, Ivan began considering how he could turn his hobby in coding into a career. Following graduation, he began looking for roles that could combine his twin interests in finance and programming, which led him to take up a SGUnited Traineeship as a Technology Analyst in UOB’s Group Technology and Operations team. In the 11 months since he began his traineeship with UOB in July 2020, Ivan’s experiences have broadened his horizons on how technologies are implemented in a bank. \"Being able to work for a bank with a regional focus, I was eager to learn what goes behind the scenes of adopting and implementing technology to transform the banking experience for customers. Through on-the-job training at UOB, I gained first-hand experience and knowledge in analysing payments systems and ways in which we can tap technology to enhance these systems at scale without compromising on risks,\" he says. A teacher and learner Another UOB employee who has witnessed the industry’s digital transformation is 51-year-old Sharon Tan, Senior Vice President, Group Finance and Corporate Services. In her 20-year career at the Bank, Sharon has taken on a variety of roles in both tech and finance. “In my career, I have seen first-hand how the financial industry has transformed, with data playing an increasingly important role in how we understand our customers’ needs to serve them better”, she says. Sharon (facing the camera) mentoring a colleagueHaving completed the UOB Finance Academy, which is approved under Workforce Singapore’s Professional Conversion Programme (PCP), Sharon has developed specialised skills in advanced data analytics, in addition to deepening her knowledge in finance and risk management. Launched in August 2020, the UOB Finance Academy is a structured three-month learning programme designed to equip all 230 employees in the Bank’s Finance function in Singapore with the soft and technical skills to help them advance in their careers. Equipped with these new skills, she is able to take on new tasks such as enhancing regulatory reporting processes using data insights and designing processes to optimise the quality of data that she manages in her daily work. With the desire to mentor the next generation of professionals at UOB, Sharon is also in the process of attaining an Associate Certified Coach certification from the International Coaching Federation. “Many young graduates are very eager, and want to become data scientists. I look forward to helping them build their confidence in interpreting and visualising business data and fuelling their creativity in harnessing the value of data in their line of work,” she explains. The key thing for young staff – and indeed workers of all career stages – to work on is developing the right mindset, Sharon explains. “We need to develop a growth mindset regardless of our age or experience. Staying hungry for knowledge and pushing our boundaries will open doors to new possibilities and opportunities.” This is a message that Ms Cheong from DBS would certainly stand behind. “I would actually give similar advice to both young graduates and more experienced workers who are interested in the Financial Services sector,” she smiles. “We take a holistic, multi-faceted view of talent that goes beyond paper qualifications. What’s key is a positive attitude, including a curiosity for learning and growth. Starting in a brand new space can be a refreshing and enriching experience.” “Keep an open mind and have the curiosity to learn.

Life has not been the same since. There were many days where I have felt discouraged. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the transport industry tremendously. During Circuit Breaker, our ridership went down quite a bit. We also had to intensify various safety precautions for our passengers, such as disinfecting high-touch points and sanitising our buses twice a day. That’s why I was happy to hear about the COVID-19 vaccines. I believe that the vaccine will protect myself, my loved ones and my passengers. I was one of the first Bus Captains to sign up for the vaccination. I chose to go for the first available slot to instill confidence and encourage my fellow colleagues and union members to do the same. As a frontliner, it is also my duty to protect myself so I can protect the passengers I meet daily. All of us have a role to play in the fight against COVID-19.

       " {'text': 'what you should know about the covid 19 vaccine Singapore received its first batch of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on 21 December. Following that, the recommendations of the Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination on its vaccination strategy for Singapore were accepted by the Government. Among its recommendations: The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine has been reviewed and endorsed for use in Singapore for individuals aged 16 and above. [Updated 3 Feb 2021] The Moderna COVID-19 vaccine has been authorised for use in Singapore. Details here. Vaccination will take place progressively, with priority given to: (i) Persons at high risk of being infected by COVID-19, including healthcare and frontline workers(ii) Persons most vulnerable to severe disease and complications if they fall ill with COVID-19. This includes the elderly and persons with medical comorbidities (those with 2 or more illnesses/diseases at the same time)Vaccinations for healthcare workers started on 30 Dec 2020, while vaccinations for the elderly (starting with those aged 70 and above) will begin from Feb 2021. Comprehensive vaccination coverage will not only protect our population, but also those who cannot be vaccinated due to medical reasons. While vaccination is encouraged, it is voluntary. To help you make a more informed decision on whether you want to be vaccinated, here are some key questions, answered.A. Why is vaccination important?Vaccination is one of the key strategies to protect us and our loved ones against COVID-19, along with safe management measures, contact tracing and testing. The Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination proposed to vaccinate the population as widely as possible to not only reduce the number of people susceptible to the disease but also the chances of transmission. As more of us are vaccinated, the harder it will be for the virus to spread, and the safer we will all be as a society.A comprehensive vaccination coverage will then enable us to re-open further, allow more social activities to resume, and facilitate the recovery of our economy. However, until a significant proportion of the population is vaccinated, Singaporeans must continue to observe safe management measures. B. How do the COVID-19 vaccines work?Vaccines work with your body’s natural defenses to protect you from diseases. When you get a vaccine, your immune system is trained to recognise the virus and produces antibodies. These antibodies attack the viruses and stay in our bodies. Of the three vaccines that Singapore had signed Advance Purchase Agreements with – Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Sinovac – the first two are messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines, while the last uses an inactivated vaccine technology. mRNA vaccines contain material from the COVID-19 virus that gives our cells instructions on how to make a harmless protein that is unique to the virus. After our cells make copies of the protein, they destroy the genetic material from the vaccine. Our bodies then recognise that the protein should not be there and build antibodies to fight the virus. Inactivated vaccine technology uses weakened or inactive viral particles to stimulate our body to produce an immune response to the COVID-19 virus.Some vaccines require multiple doses, given weeks or months apart. This allows us to produce long-lived antibodies and develop memory cells – so that our bodies can rapidly fight the virus should we be exposed to it again. Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, World Health OrganisationMore info on vaccines here and here. C. Are COVID-19 vaccines safe, especially for the elderly and those who are vulnerable? The safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines for all Singaporeans is of utmost importance. Only vaccines that comply with the World Health Organisation’s guidelines and meet strict standards of safety, quality and efficacy will be used for our population. Multiple safety checks are in place before the vaccines are rolled-out in Singapore. For example, all vaccines to be deployed in Singapore must be authorised by the Health Sciences Authority. An expert panel, comprising 18 scientists and clinicians, was also formed to advise the Government on therapeutics and vaccines. In identifying suitable vaccines, the panel relies on data that comes from the different vaccine companies at their respective stages of clinical trials. Read more about the processes put in place here.D. How was the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine evaluated?In assessing the suitability of vaccine candidates, the Expert Committee took into consideration vaccine safety and efficacy, vaccine tolerability, as well as data adequacy of clinical trials.The Health Sciences Authority authorised the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, based on the following assessment: It has a high vaccine efficacy of 95% in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 disease in vaccinated persons aged 16 years and older. Its safety profile is consistent with other established and registered vaccines. No significant safety concerns have been detected. Common side effects were expected as part of the body’s natural response to a vaccination, such as injection site pain, fever, fatigue and headache. The benefits outweigh the known risks. But continued monitoring for longer-term efficacy of the vaccine, as well as monitoring for rare and serious adverse events will be needed. Until more information is available, pregnant women and those under 16 years old should not receive the vaccine. It is also not recommended at this stage for immunocompromised individuals.E. Are there side-effects?Some people may experience side-effects such as fever, redness and swelling at the injection site. These are common side-effects and expected as part of the body’s natural response towards build immunity against COVID-19. Hear what Prof Benjamin Seet has to say about the thorough review process for safety and tolerability. F. Who should take the vaccine?COVID-19 vaccination may be voluntary, but the Government strongly encourages all who are medically eligible to be vaccinated when it is offered to you. When more of us are vaccinated, the harder it will be for the virus to spread, and the safer we will be as a society. Priority will be given to those at greater risk of infection, such as healthcare and COVID-19 frontline workers, as well as vulnerable groups, including seniors. Pregnant women, people with compromised immune systems and those under 16 years old should not receive the vaccine yet, until more data is available. G. How much does it cost to be vaccinated? All Singaporeans and long-term residents in Singapore will be able to be vaccinated for free. Migrant workers will also be offered the vaccine, with more details to be announced.', 'id': 'd07a6082-bedb-4046-956a-00aec94a6cec', 'score': None, 'probability': None, 'question': None, 'meta': {'category': 'articles'}, 'embedding': None},\n",
       " {'text': 'update on covid 19 vaccination programme and guidance on the use of masks Singapore continues to make steady progress with our vaccination programme. As of 17 May, more than 3.4 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine were administered, with close to 2 million individuals who have received at least the first dose of the vaccine. To date, about 71% of eligible seniors aged 60 and above, and close to 66% of eligible persons aged 45 to 59 years old have received the COVID-19 vaccination or booked their vaccination appointments. Start of vaccination for those aged 40 to 44 years oldThe next band of those aged 40 to 44 years old will be invited to register for their COVID-19 vaccinations from Wednesday, 19 May 2021. Singapore’s supply of vaccines has been steadily coming in but remains limited given the high global demand. Singapore will continue to roll out the vaccination programme, but now in five-year age bands – starting with those aged 40 to 44 years old and progressively moving to younger age groups.Individuals can only register online via vaccine.gov.sg Upon their registration, they will receive an acknowledgement SMS A separate SMS with a personalised booking link to book a vaccination appointment will then be progressively sent to invite eligible individuals on a first-come-first-served basis, based on their time of registration Individuals should expect to receive this booking SMS within 1 to 2 weeks from registration, with appointment slots available up to mid-June Those who have registered their interest previously will not need to re-register More appointment slots for vaccination will be made available as more supplies arrive. Singapore remains on track with our COVID-19 vaccination programme. Extension of the vaccine dosing interval to between 6 to 8 weeksTo provide vaccines for more people, the Multi-Ministry Taskforce on COVID-19 will be prioritising first doses of the vaccines and extending the interval between the first and second doses from 3 or 4 weeks, to 6 to 8 weeks. This will apply to vaccination registrations that occur from Wednesday, 19 May 2021. Those who already have appointments for their second doses will not be affected. This approach is adopted in consultation with the Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination which had studied scientific evidence globally in clinical trials and real-world roll-out of these vaccines. The maximum interval between mRNA COVID-19 vaccines could be extended to up to eight weeks to maximise vaccine coverage, without materially impacting the eventual overall immune response, as long as the second dose is eventually administered. This conclusion is based on the data from the original mRNA trials, which has been bolstered recently by emerging information from real-world observations, laboratory studies and simulations. The approach of prioritising first dose vaccinations has also been adopted by countries such as the United Kingdom and Germany. HSA approval of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for those aged 12 to 15 years oldAs for individuals aged 12 to 15 years old, the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) has authorised the use of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine under Pandemic Special Access Route (PSAR). The Expert Committee has also endorsed this extension of the interim authorisation of the vaccine by HSA to this age group. The Committee considered the safety, efficacy and tolerability of the vaccine, and the study design of clinical trials for this age group. The data showed that the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine demonstrated high efficacy consistent with that observed in the adult population. Its safety profile is also consistent with the known safety profile in the adult population and the standards set for other registered vaccines used in the immunisation against other diseases.The Ministry of Health (MOH) will work with the Ministry of Education (MOE) on vaccination for this school-going age group and provide further updates in due course. Improvingaccess to COVID-19 vaccination for homebound personsTofacilitate the vaccination of homebound persons who are unable to travel to avaccination site, MOH has worked with the Health Promotion Board and theAgency for Integrated Care to deploy home vaccination teams, comprising adoctor and a nurse, to vaccinate these persons at their homes. Eligiblehomebound persons receiving home medical, nursing or personal care serviceswill be approached by their current home care service provider to ascertaintheir interest in getting vaccinated through this service. If they have notbeen contacted, they can register their interest directly with their currenthome care service provider. Homeboundpersons currently not receiving these home care services can appeal for thisservice by calling the MOH hotline 1800-333-9999. This service is strictlymeant for persons who are homebound. Persons who are not homebound are stronglyencouraged to make an appointment to get vaccinated at any of the vaccinationsites, when vaccination is offered to them. Updated guidancefor use of masksThe use ofmasks continue to be one of the key public health strategies in preventingdisease by reducing the expulsion and transmission of droplets. The recentclusters suggest a higher level of transmission, likely attributed to new virusvariants. Use mask with good filtration capability Includes reusable masks that are made of at least 2 layers of fabric, and surgical masks Check product specifications of single-use masks for their filtration efficiency Use reusable masks such as masks issued by the People’s Association and Temasek Foundation which have good filtration efficiencyMOH and HSA will put up guidelines to aid the public in choosing good masks.

In particular, there are allegations that a doctor had suffered a stroke and an 81-year-old man had passed away from heart attack as a consequence and result of receiving the COVID-19 vaccination. These allegations are false.We also note that there are third parties who have exploited the sharing of personal experiences by individuals, by reposting these personal accounts and making unsubstantiated claims about vaccine-related adverse reactions. They often continue to do so despite the original posts being removed or made private.FactsAs of 14 April 2021, there is no credible evidence for an increased risk of heart attack or stroke with the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines which are currently approved and offered in Singapore.The medical team caring for the doctor has assessed that the doctor’s current condition is highly unlikely to be related to the COVID-19 vaccination, and Mount Elizabeth Hospital had issued a clarification on 4 April 2021.The cause of death of the 81-year-old man was ischaemic heart disease (lack of blood circulation to the heart muscles). The Health Sciences Authority (HSA) Forensic Medicine Division has reported that based on post-mortem, there was no evidence of acute anaphylaxis or an allergic reaction at the injection site of the COVID-19 vaccine. There was extensive narrowing of the 3 main blood vessels supplying blood to the muscles of the heart due to atherosclerosis (build up of plaques over time in the blood vessels that obstruct blood flow).COVID-19 vaccines that are used in Singapore have been assessed to be safe and efficacious by both the HSA and the Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination. Medical teams are well-equipped and measures are in place at all vaccination sites to ensure the safety of vaccine recipients pre-, during, and post-vaccination. All vaccine-related incidents are taken seriously and healthcare professionals are required to report these incidents expediently to the Ministry of Health and HSA.Additional ClarificationsThe Vaccine Injury Financial Assistance Programme for COVID-19 Vaccination (VIFAP) provides one-time goodwill financial assistance to persons who experience serious side effects that are assessed to be related to COVID-19 vaccine administered in Singapore. To apply for VIFAP, individuals will need to submit an application accompanied by medical information on the serious side effect from their treating doctor. As the severity of serious side effects can be broad-ranging and the clinical assessment by doctors may vary, all VIFAP applications will be assessed and adjudicated by a MOH-appointed independent clinical panel comprising experts in relevant fields such as neurology, immunology, and infectious diseases. The VIFAP is not meant to reimburse medical costs. It provides an additional layer on financial support, on top of the existing government healthcare financing schemes for medical costs incurred, which include government subsidies, MediShield Life, MediSave, and MediFund.

       " {'text': 'enhanced measures for testing and contact tracing Frequent and widespread testing will allow for more economic and social activities to continue in a safe manner. Currently, the deployment of the Antigen Rapid Test (ART) is being piloted for regular surveillance testing for workers in dorms, construction sites, airport and selected marine shipyards. This will soon be progressively rolled out in other setting such as in student hostels in autonomous universities and at selected malls.With the increase in household transmission of the COVID-19 virus being observed, all household members of persons who have been identified as a close contact of confirmed COVID-19 cases are to self-isolate at home with immediate effect. Increase Surveillance Testing Using Antigen Rapid Tests (ARTs)The Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test has been effective in detecting positive COVID-19 cases. However, results for the PCR test can take more than a day. Newer tests, such as ARTs, complement existing testing regimes as they are cheaper, faster, and more convenient to administer, thus making them very effective surveillance tests. This allows the scale of testing to be expanded to the wider population, allowing for early identification of potential infections so that public health actions can be triggered sooner to stem further spread. As a start, ARTs have been piloted for regular surveillance testing for workers in dorms, construction sites, airport and selected marine shipyards. This is in addition to the PCR-based Rostered Routine Testing. This pilot will be extended to student hostels in autonomous universities, and selected CapitaLand malls for tenants and people who work there. ARTs can also be deployed at workplaces and made available for over-the-counter sales. All workplaces and employers are encouraged to adopt regular testing using such alternative testing methods to keep their staff and customers safe. Household Contacts of Persons Under Quarantine to Self-IsolateCurrently, close contacts of a confirmed COVID-19 case are issued quarantine orders and are isolated at Government Quarantine Facilities or at home for 14 days from the last day of exposure to an infected individual. As an added precaution, household contacts of persons under quarantine are to self-isolate at home and minimise their social interactions. They are to do so until the person under quarantine receives a negative COVID-19 test result or the person is no longer under quarantine. This will help to limit the spread of the virus, after increased transmission between those in the same household are observed. Enhancing testing and contract tracing regimes, coupled with more of the population being vaccinated, will allow for more work and activities to resume in a safe manner, even as the COVID-19 situation continues to evolve.

       " {'text': 'roadmap to phase 3 To move towards Phase Three, testing and tracing efforts must be scaled up while everyone continues to adhere to the safe management measures. In this way, more activities can progressively resume while community transmissions are kept low.Phase Three does not mean a return to pre-COVID times. Until the virus is under control with widely available vaccines, we must be prepared to stay in Phase Three for a prolonged period, potentially over a year. However, if we put in more enablers, more activities can gradually resume under Phase Three. Key Enablers for Phase Three1. Continued Adherence to Safe Management MeasuresThere has been a resurgence of COVID-19 in other countries as they open up to more activities or due to lack of adherence to safe management measures. To ensure that the situation in Singapore remains under control, we will have to keep up the habits and practices of the past few months. Small group sizes Limits on group sizes will continue, both in public spaces and visitors to the home. Safe distancing Requirements on safe distancing will continue to disallow or minimise interactions between groups. Social responsibility Mask-wearing and personal hygiene protect us and others from COVID-19. Those with symptoms of acute respiratory infection should seek medical attention at the earliest opportunity and follow up with a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) swab test if instructed by the doctor. 2. Pre-event TestingTo allow more activities to resume safely, the Multi-Ministry Taskforce (MMTF) is piloting the use of pre-event testing for larger-scale and higher-risk activities.Due to the need for a shorter turnaround, the use of antigen rapid tests is being explored for pre-event testing. With its lower sensitivity compared to the PCR test, safe management measures including mask-wearing and safe distancing will still be in place.From mid-October to December 2020, pre-event testing will take place at wedding receptions, live performances and sports events, among others. Feedback from the events will be used to finetune processes, and the Ministry of Health (MOH) will assess which can be implemented more widely. 3. Expansion of Digital Contact Tracing ToolsWhile the use of SafeEntry has strengthened the ability to detect COVID-19 clusters quickly, greater participation in the TraceTogether Programme is required to help identify close contacts of COVID-19 positive cases.Consequently, a higher take-up rate for TraceTogether is needed before Phase Three can begin. This will enable MOH to quickly contact trace and ringfence any infections.TraceTogether-only Safe Entry, where visitors are required to either scan the QR code using the TraceTogether App or present the TraceTogether Token, must also be expanded.This will ensure that persons visiting places where people are likely to be in contact for prolonged periods, or where human traffic is high, have either the TraceTogether App or Token. TraceTogether-only Safe Entry will be gradually introduced at workplaces, schools and public venues such as cinemas.TraceTogether tokens are available for collection at 38 Community Centres/ Clubs (CCs), and are expected to be available at all 108 CCs by end-November 2020. Head down to the TokenGoWhere website to locate a convenient site for collection. Moving to Phase ThreeWith these enablers in place and everyone’s cooperation, we will be able to move to Phase Three. However, the exact timing of these changes will depend on our collective ability to cooperate with the requirements.1. Increasing Group SizeIn Phase Three, the group size for gatherings outside the home and number of visitors allowed to homes could be increased from the present 5 persons to 8 persons.2.Increasing Capacity LimitsPublic venues such as museums are currently open but subject to a capacity limit, while events like wedding receptions can be held in two zones of 50 persons. In Phase Three, these capacity limits could be increased, with events having multiple zones of 50 persons.These adjustments will have to be done in a controlled way and additional measures would apply for specific settings. For example, wedding receptions are higher-risk activities, where many people are gathered for a meal. Any expansion in the number of attendees would require additional safety measures, including a pre-event test. 3.Considerations for Activities in Higher-Risk SettingsHigher-risk settings like bars, pubs, karaoke lounges and nightclubs are closed as their activities pose a higher risk of transmission. Though these activities are unlikely to resume at the start of Phase Three, the MMTF is considering a few limited pilots with a more stringent set of measures to explore how the industry could resume safely. Where there is non-resumption, the Government will put in place an assistance package to help business operators transit to new areas.4.Facilitating travel and re-opening of bordersAs a key international and travel hub, Singapore cannot keep our borders closed and needs to gradually allow more travel to resume safely.Presently, travelers from low-risk countries/ regions are allowed to enter Singapore with a COVID-19 test instead of a Stay-Home Notice (SHN), while those from higher-risk countries/ regions are required to serve a SHN at home or at dedicated facilities. The MMTF is exploring ways to deploy more frequent testing to allow more travelers to safely enter Singapore without serving a SHN.In line with the progressive move to reopen our borders, all Singaporeans, Permanent Residents and Long-Term Pass Holders will now be allowed to access government subsidies and insurance coverage for their medical bills.Road to Phase Three and BeyondEven as these adjustments are made, the MMTF will also continue to explore vaccines, treatment, testing and other technologies which could enable us to further ease restrictions and resume travel safely.Read more:', 'id': '85e8a612-1823-4c35-bc2f-9ae0c922cb2c', 'score': None, 'probability': None, 'question': None, 'meta': {'category': 'articles'}, 'embedding': None},\n",

No need to fret – at least not according to Mr Teo Khee Huat and Mdm Chue Khuan Hou, both Singaporeans who received their COVID-19 vaccinations, despite suffering from underlying health conditions.For Mr Teo and Mdm Chue, getting vaccinated means that they can stay healthy and active for themselves and their loved ones. As Mr Teo shared: “Early prevention is better than cure!”“I started experiencing health issues in 2008 when I found occasional blood clots in the stools. I went to the polyclinic, thinking it was piles. But they ended up finding a 2.5cm tumour in my colon, that I soon learnt was cancerous.A biopsy also found that I had a rare skin cancer. It was very early stage cancer, so thankfully, I didn’t have to go through chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Through surgery, the doctors managed to remove the tumour in my colon.When I was offered the COVID-19 vaccine, I said, ‘Sure, why not!’. The cancer was in remission so there were no issues taking the vaccine.I’ve also been taking blood thinning medications for Chronic Venous Insufficiency, enlarged prostate glands and an irregular heartbeat. To make sure I could take the vaccines, I checked with the doctor at the vaccination centre, who gave me the go-ahead to do so.The morning after my first jab, I felt well enough to go for my 3km brisk walk. I didn’t experience any issues with my second jab too.My friends ask me if I’ve done my jab. Some say they prefer to wait and see. I assured one of them, ‘You are only 80 years old! My jogging kakis are 86 and 90 and they went through the jab with no issues! We are living examples.’We always say that early diagnosis is the best treatment for cancer. The chance of recovery is higher. Likewise, for COVID-19 - if there is a way to prevent it, why not?\"–Teo Khee Huat, 78, colorectal and skin cancer survivor, Chairperson of the Singapore Cancer Society SemiColon Support Group “I’ve had high cholesterol for about 10 years. I also went for an angioplasty (ballooning) before – for blocked arteries. Because of my heart condition, before I went for the vaccination, I checked with the doctor at the polyclinic to ask if it was suitable for me. He assured me that it is suitable, and encouraged me to go for it. With that, I asked my daughter to help me to register for the vaccination.I did my injections at the Community Club. The wait took about 5 to 10 minutes, and then after taking the jab, I waited half an hour to make sure everything was ok. I didn’t have noticeable side effects after the jabs.Vaccination is important because I want to continue to be active. Every morning, I do a little exercise, then I go to the market to get food and groceries. I also want to be healthy enough to look after my 11-month-old grandson.Because of my medical conditions, I think it’s even more important that I take the COVID-19 vaccination.

Hear more from Larry Ong, a cancer survivor with multiple drug allergies, and Mohd Isa, a diabetic patient undergoing weekly dialysis. Both Larry and Isa had the go-ahead from their doctors to be vaccinated, after a brief consultation on their medical history. If you are unsure of your COVID-19 vaccination eligibility, remember to consult your doctors or check with the medical staff at your vaccination site!“I was initially rejected for the COVID-19 vaccine. Not because of my medical conditions, but because I’m allergic to 3 drugs – 2 are painkillers (Synflex and Ibuprofen), and the other is a high blood pressure medication (Lisinopril). When I take these drugs, I get a face rash.However, I was still keen to get vaccinated to be protected from COVID-19.I was hoping to be eligible despite taking medication for high blood pressure and high cholesterol for the past 10 years. I also had 2nd stage Thymoma cancer but it is now in remission.With that in mind, I thought that I should go to the vaccination centre to check with the nurse. After I went, they asked me if I had breathlessness when the allergy was triggered. I said no I didn’t, so they said ok, I can go for it.After the jabs, I had some mild side effects – an arm ache for a couple of days. But everything has settled and I feel fine now.No matter if you’re young or old, it’s still better to get vaccinated. We don’t know when this virus will hit us, maybe even from the person closest to you.Let’s protect ourselves, our families and our friends.”– Larry Ong, 68, retiree and cancer-survivor“I’ve had kidney problems since 2017. There was nothing much else the doctor could do. I remember he said, ‘Your kidneys – gone already’. Now I go for dialysis three times a week at the National Kidney Foundation (NKF) centre.I’m also diabetic and I take my insulin medication twice a day - once in the morning, once at night.Despite my medical conditions, I took the second dose of my COVID-19 vaccination about 3 weeks ago. It was ok, just a small pinch when the nurse injected me.Before going, I asked my kidney doctor at the NKF whether I should go. She knows my medical reports and history, and she said, ‘If you feel ok, you should go’.When I was at the vaccination centre, the doctors checked again. They asked me ‘Everything ok, no allergy?’ I went through screening and they said I could take it.Some people talk about getting fever from the vaccine. I tell my friends, ‘Don’t be scared, you can take a Panadol to feel better.’ It’s been good so far, I don’t have much problems.Whenever my friends and I catch up at the kopitiam, we’d say, “since the Government give you free (vaccination), better go!

       " {'text': \"sm tharman the global jobs crisis and why we should think longer term We are on uncharted terrain. COVID-19 is a historic challenge, but we are really faced with three testing realities at the same time. We have the immediate challenge of a public health and economic crisis, both of global scale. But tackling this is complicated by the second reality - that of a new future that is already unfolding before us, for which we have to re-gear ourselves. The shape of demand, supply chains and the way work is organized are all changing, and with them the job market. COVID-19 and the fear of future pandemics have brought on a new normal that we must adapt to. Third, we inherit long-standing legacies, now made more challenging by the COVID-19 crisis: the stagnation of middle incomes in the advanced world, widening inequalities, the growing prospect of pension gaps in many countries, and an ever more serious climate crisis. It is these three realities interacting together that make this an immensely complex, dynamic and daunting time — for public policy, for society, and for politics everywhere. Focusing on today’s problems in themselves, without both addressing the problems we inherit and equipping ourselves for a structurally different future, will make the years to come even more testing, and fraught with danger. Too early for creative destructionPolicy-makers have passed the first phase of tackling the economic crisis, where most nations were focused on avoiding the extreme downsides arising from COVID-19 and lockdowns. We wanted to avoid mass unemployment and a large wave of bankruptcies, which would have led to a self-reinforcing spiral of declining incomes and public spirit. We are now at a transition point. We cannot protect existing jobs, firms and industry capacity to the extent seen in the first phase. Most countries do not have the fiscal capacity to do so. Strategically too, we have to let some of today’s firms and jobs go, to enable new growth and more promising jobs to be created. We have to allow for ‘creative destruction’, to secure vibrant economies over the longer-term.However, we cannot pivot policies too quickly into this next phase. Our economies are still in significant slack, the virus is far from tamed, and there is risk of repeated lockdowns especially during the northern winter. Even on optimistic assumptions, it will take much more than a year to get back to full economic life. Furthermore, withdrawing support too quickly will not lead to efficient market restructuring — the rechanneling of labor, capital and other resources that takes us to a better place — in the way we would expect in a typical downturn. We are operating with little visibility of the future, hampering the ability of either policymakers or markets to discriminate between firms that are loss-making today but remain viable for the future and the zombies that limp along on life support. Creative destruction without this visibility will lead to too many good firms and jobs being destroyed. The Central Problem: JobsThe central economic problem of the times lies in labour markets. First, there is a real prospect of prolonged high unemployment in many economies. It is not at all assured that we will get back to tight labor markets, even with traditional macroeconomic policies working the way they should. Second, we have to counter the long-term stagnation of median incomes seen in a whole range of advanced economies, with a few like Sweden and Singapore being the exceptions. It cannot be achieved without reviving productivity growth.Third, we have to address the trend towards a polarized job market — with more jobs being created at the high and low skilled ends of the labor market and fewer in the middle, and the growth of an insecure gig workforce. Each of these is a difficult challenge, and overcoming all three even more so. While employment recovered well in some major economies in the decade after the Global Financial Crisis, productivity growth weakened (and indeed was part of the reason why employment recovered) and job polarization became more severe. There have been some periods in history where we were able to achieve all three objectives. One of the drivers of economic development, which Nobel Laureate Arthur Lewis and other economists highlighted, consisted of surplus labor being freed up from low-productivity sectors (originally agriculture) and taken up by sectors which had higher productivity such as manufacturing. That reallocation of labor is how low-income countries became middle income, and some middle-income countries became advanced. But the experience of recent years in many advanced economies has been the reverse — with labor being shed from industries that are dynamic and at the higher end of the productivity ladder, and channeled into lower-productivity, lower-wage occupations. In fact, the main engine of job growth in the United States and several other countries has been in lower-paid services — in F&B, cleaning, security, and a range of other domestic services.COVID-19 has introduced a major disruption to this already polarized, barbell-shaped market. The bottom end of the barbell is now itself shrinking. A whole range of service tasks is being eliminated by e-commerce, remote work, virtual presence, and the safe distancing and other new protocols that we will probably have to live with for some years. What this means is that the market receptacle for labor displaced from higher productivity industries has shrunk. It was a receptacle of lower-pay and less secure jobs, but what is even more unattractive now is the prospect of fewer such jobs. We also face, in particular, the unravelling of some of the gains in women’s participation in the labor force and sense of self-determination that were achieved over decades. Women have been disproportionately represented in the human-facing jobs that are being hurt. The closure of childcare and schools, each time it happens, has also unfortunately translated into more women than men staying at home to look after their kids. We have to apply ourselves now and over the next few years to this central problem of jobs: making sure we have enough jobs, and that people do not get trapped over time in low skill, low pay work. Widening the distribution of good jobsWhat are some of the initiatives that we have to focus on? We have to focus not only on macro-economic stimulus, but increasingly on the microeconomic incentives we create, and on new forms of collaboration between government, business and communities. First, we have to gradually phase out subsidies for existing jobs and instead provide strong incentive for job creation. In other words, we should shift from subsidizing the stock of jobs towards incentivizing the flow of new jobs. Singapore is doing so with our Jobs Growth Initiative, as we step down the significant subsidies for today’s jobs that our Jobs Support Scheme provided in the first phase of the crisis. Second, we have to put great energy into the coordination needed to help people who are displaced to get back into jobs, and to avoid as much as possible ill-fitting job matches that could lead to a permanent reduction in their wages. We must do all we can to avoid people being detached from work for an extended period, to prevent the depreciation of skills and morale that comes with that, and increased barriers to their employment. Economists call it ‘hysteresis’. It is a real risk in the coming months and years.However, the aim of job matching cannot simply be about speed. It is not about getting someone any job as soon as possible, because that can mean losing the value of the skills they have accumulated. As much as possible, we have to find jobs that build on a person's skills and experiences. A key coordination task, therefore, is to find those jobs with adjacent or complementary requirements, and to move swiftly to top up the skills that the job-seeker brings. We cannot take too long to help someone secure a new job, but we have to strive for a good match with the human capital they have accumulated, so that they do not lose it, and society does not lose it. Getting to this outcome is not easy, because labor markets suffer from imperfect information. It requires joining up career coaching, job matching and skills development programs. This is a very human enterprise, but greatly aided now by new ICT and AI tools. The most effective systems have involved official agencies playing an active coordinating role, working with employers, job-seekers, unions or other social partners, and training providers. In the context of the current uncertainties, significant state subsidies are also required to encourage employers to recruit and train people. If we leave it to the market, we will see longer spells of joblessness.We have to recognize too, in the wake of the pandemic, that it will take time before hiring for permanent jobs comes back on the scale we need. We have to incentivize firms to take in people on attachments of various forms, even if they cannot take on permanent hires. This means not just youth apprenticeships, but traineeships for mature workers in their 40s and 50s. We have to work with industry partners to curate traineeships, get people back into the workplace, and help them to add to their skills. We must find every way to avoid a long-term detachment from work, and the permanent scarring that comes with that. Third, we have to go beyond the mantra of life-long learning, to make it a practical reality for blue-collar and ordinary white-collar workers. All experience, even in northern Europe where the tradition is most established, shows that it has been much harder to get this going for ordinary workers than for high-skilled professionals, which only accentuates existing inequalities. That has to be a core focus of public-private collaboration – developing quality training options that workers find appealing and relevant to their careers, and using technologies and community outreach programs that make learning convenient when they are not on the job. It also requires increased agility in the system, to enable firms and workers to develop new skills quickly as the economy restructures. Fourth, we have to encourage those forms of automation that create new tasks or stimulate new demands that play to human strengths. Technological advances have historically both displaced workers and increased the demand for labor in new areas — either within the same industry or indirectly in the rest of the economy. It has enabled society to stay fully employed while productivity moved up. But that is an empirical regularity, not a law. Serious economists, as well as business and technology leaders themselves, have differing views on whether we can be equally sanguine about an emerging generation of increasingly potent technologies, or whether we are heading for a permanent state of higher joblessness. We will not know in advance. But we know that some new technologies, like collaborative robots, augmented reality and certain AI tools, generate more demand for human skills, including mid-level skills, than other advances. Tax codes today incentivize automation in almost every form and everywhere, even in countries where labor markets face significant long-term slack. It is not too early to consider how public policy can encourage automation and skills development of the kinds that can complement one another, so we increase the chances of a new era of widely-distributed good jobs. Fifth, we need collectively-determined solutions to ensure that growth of worker compensation does not trend below productivity growth, as has happened over the last few decades in many economies. Institutional interventions, involving the state, are especially needed where the problem of low or lagging wages reflects either the weakened bargaining power of workers or increased monopsony power of employers. Ideally too, these interventions should be accompanied by efforts to develop new social and employer mindsets, so that new norms can persist in the labor market without requiring perpetual state intervention. Norms do appear to vary across countries, especially with regard to pay for women and less-skilled workers. Sixth, we need strategies to ensure that the SME sector survives and adapts to the new, post-pandemic normal, to avoid much larger job losses in time as well as greater wage inequalities. SMEs are disproportionately represented in the service sectors, where jobs have been most vulnerable to the impact of COVID-19 and national lockdowns. They also face greater funding risk than large firms in an environment of uncertainty. While a churn of businesses is inevitable and needed, there is a real risk of a diminished SME sector as a whole, compounding the increases in industry concentration seen over the last few decades in many economies. That trend if it continues will have implications for future economic vibrance. It will likely also have an intangible impact on social capital. Governments and central banks have been quick to ensure near-term credit support for SMEs. But we have to look beyond this. Quite apart from updated competition policies, what form of cluster strategies can we get to work well, and to enable better diffusion of innovation from the frontier firms to the rest? How do we incentivize test-bedding of innovations in small firms themselves? How do we aggregate and organise skills training for their workers, to address the growing gaps in skill levels between large and small firms? How do we promote digital platforms — and especially inter-operable cross-border platforms — that small firms can plug into, so they can benefit from the scale economies of the digital economy?Monetary and FiscalPolicies: Taking the Long View Monetary policy has succeeded in buffering economies and financial systems against a severe shock to confidence amidst COVID-19. However, relying chiefly on monetary policy to get economies back to full health will be less effective over time and holding interest rates near zero over a prolonged period may have counter-productive effects.Fiscal policy therefore has to play a more important role, in concert with labor market and industrial policy reforms. But it also requires a repurposing of the state - to defy secular stagnation, to catalyse the green economy, to rekindle social mobility and build equal opportunities, and to go about these objectives with a spirit of activism.Expansive fiscal policies will make sense for a while, probably a few years in most economies. But the real debate has to move from questions around immediate stimulus effects, to how we achieve our longer-term goals. We need a different kind of Keynesianism: an active state aimed at long-term recovery and regeneration, nationally and globally.We have to refocus on public goods, which used to be a fundamental purpose of government budgets. They are now greatly underinvested in, not only in the emerging world but in most advanced economies. The pandemic was a harsh reminder of this, with public health systems overwhelmed in many countries. But this is now a huge opportunity around the world: investments to achieve broad-based quality in public education systems, including regularly refreshed technical and applied training; in more accessible and affordable healthcare; in universal broadband access; in upgraded water and transport networks; in R&D for clean energies, sustainable agriculture and the circular economy.We will not be able to fund these investments on public balance sheets alone. The redesign of fiscal strategy must also involve catalyzing private investment in public goods. There are many examples of how this can be done, including ways to achieve a fair sharing of the risks on such investments.Remember that this pandemic is not the last we will face, and the next pandemic may very possibly be more challenging than what we are going through today. So we do need, once we have emerged from this crisis, to rebuild fiscal space to deal with future shocks – and at least avoid a continuing build-up of debt-to-GDP ratios. Most governments will have to strengthen tax revenues. They will have to do so while giving a fair deal to those with lower and middle incomes, and ensuring that fiscal systems meet the challenge of politically durability.The repurposing of the state requires boldness of imagination, and the marshalling of public support around nations’ long-term goals. It will help rebuild broad-based prosperity and cohesive societies, and can put us on course to an ecologically viable future. It may be our only chance.Tharman Shanmugaratnam is Senior Minister and Coordinating Minister for Social Policies.

       " {'text': 'driving the sustainability spirit in our local community 1.6 million kilograms of food redistributed and prevented from going to waste– that’s what a team of 10 persons from the Food Bank Singapore achieved last year. That is equivalent to the weight of about 104 single-deck SBS Transit buses. The Food Bank Singapore was founded by siblings Nichol Ng, 43, and Nicholas Ng, 42 who run a food distribution business. Through their work, they observed that Singapore had been generating a tremendous amount of food waste. “Most of us who were born post-independence never had to struggle with putting food on the table as Singapore is a food haven – make that an affordable food haven. Where else can you get a $3.00 hot meal in a first world country? Because of this, some of us do not think twice about dumping food,” Nichol says.Nichol and Nicholas Ng (middle), co-founders of Food Bank Singapore and their teamThe Ngs realised that together with their peers in the F&B industry, they were well-positioned to play a much bigger role in fighting food waste and food insecurity in Singapore.Using innovation to overcome constraintsBut tackling food waste and food insecurity was not at all easy. In fact, things became even tougher with the COVID-19 pandemic.For one, there was a severe drop in volunteers. “We rely mostly on volunteers to get the work done. With COVID-19, we had to make do with fewer volunteers in a confined space to sort out the food,” Nichol explains. In addition, it was extremely challenging to distribute food to households during the Circuit Breaker period, with the limited manpower and COVID-19 regulations in place.Even though the organisation was given the greenlight to operate during that period (“We had the opportunity to go door-to-door”), the Food Bank team had to devise ways to streamline manpower, working closely with the Ministry of Social and Family Development to cross-check the names of beneficiaries so that the assistance rendered would not be duplicated. Another innovation that’s in the works is the Virtual Food Banking App, “It is something that will change the way food aid is being distributed once we get it fully off the ground. The idea is to go digital as much as possible with our ops,” Nichol says. Despite facing many challenges during the period, the team has continuously worked on fresh projects to break new grounds to improve the efficacy of food distribution. Fixing the buy and throwaway culture Previously a mechanical engineer, Danny Lim, 53, joined Repair Kopitiam as a Community Innovator after hearing about the corporate social responsibility project by Sustainable Living Lab, a local movement looking at sustainability issues. “People come here to attend coaching sessions, to learn how to fix their beloved barang at the community repair meetup sessions, and give their barang a new lease of life,” says Danny. Besides consumerism, another factor that deters people from learning how to fix their own appliances is the fear of getting an electric shock. Many of us may relate to our parents’ reminders, like “Don’t touch the sockets with your wet hands, otherwise you will get an electric shock,” says Danny, who adds that repairing appliances is safe, as long as you take the necessary precautions. Appreciating the value in objectsDespite having a mechanical engineering background, Danny explains that it was not at all easy to apply his knowledge at the community repair meetup sessions. He often encounters different repair problems and unique challenges with people coming forward to repair their items. “Interpersonal skills are more important than repair knowledge here”, Danny chuckles.Danny Lim (2ndrow, third from the right) with his team of volunteers at Repair KopitiamAs sharedby Danny, the objective of running these community repair sessions is to helpchange people’s mindsets that things can be repaired and inspire them to learnhow to repair. People from all walks of life come to the sessions to get thingsrepaired for various reasons, including saving money, or to save items ofsentimental value. Some of thesevisitors, who initially turned up to get help to fix their items, later becamerepair coaches themselves, after seeing the value of the sessions. Repairingitems can also help seniors with mild cognitive impairment. Seniors with this impairment often find it difficult tooperate new appliances, as their memory to operate such items remain in thepast. “Mild cognitive impairment is reversible if the person can find a hobbythat requires troubleshooting and logical diagnosis,” Danny explains. Repairingthese items can help them to struggle less in operating their older appliances.Witnessingthese positive outcomes, Danny encourages more people to join the communityrepair meetup sessions. “Come toRepair Kopitiam and get a slot with us, don’t just throw it (broken appliances)away. Start sustainability small – it can be from zero to hero.”SingaporeGreen Plan 2030The Singapore Green Plan 2030 was launched recently as awhole-of-nation movement to advance Singapore’s agenda on sustainabledevelopment. Nichol says that she sees the plan as a means for NGOs and organisations to push ahead boldly with sustainability ideas. “It is an extension of what we are already doing as a country for years. The plan has given our country something even more concrete to work towards beyond just growing the GDP numbers.” Danny shares similar sentiments, “To me, it’s about actionable, achievable targets which can help movements like Repair Kopitiam collaborate with other like-minded individuals and organisations to do more by sharing resources.” Share your ideas for the SG Green Plan 2030 at: greenplan.gov.sg/take-action/share-your-ideas/ What you can do Volunteer and participate – get involved with the community here Become a NEA volunteer: nea.gov.sg/programmes-grants/volunteering Become a Food Bank Singapore volunteer: foodbank.sg/volunteer-new/ Become a Repair Kopitiam volunteer: repairkopitiam.sg/volunteer/ Practice the 3Rs – reduce, reuse and recycle: Reducing, Reusing, Recycling: 5 fun facts Adopt an energy-efficient lifestyle and use energy-efficient appliances Some tips to prevent food waste Don’t shop on an empty stomach because you tend to buy more when you’re hungry Housekeep your office inventory and home pantry/refrigerator regularly Make a shopping list before you head out to get your groceries When dining out, bring a container and takeaway what you cannot finish Support local whenever you can.

       " {'text': 'food security its not just about the eggs As supermarket shelves emptied out at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and as supply chains bringing in food from other parts of the world were disrupted, we wondered: What if our food runs out?After all, more than 90 percent of Singapore’s food comes from other countries.The fact is, that is very unlikely.Behind the scenes, public servants and other agencies work hard to ensure that Singapore is able to get safe, quality food from many different countries. Not just eggs, but also meat, vegetables, rice, and food types we are used to.This did not just take place during COVID-19, but is the result of years of effort which is paying off now.In fact, Singapore was ranked number 1 in the world in the Global Food Security Index – which measures if people have access to affordable, quality food - for the second year running in 2019.Who makes sure Singapore has food?Many different agencies are involved, in taking care of different aspects of Singapore’s food supply.Some of these include the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) which oversees food safety and security, the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI), Enterprise Singapore (ESG), and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) to facilitate agri-trade and tie up importers with potential new suppliers overseas.During COVID-19, many other agencies were involved in safeguarding Singapore’s food supply, including even Singapore Airlines to fly in food.What do they do?They collectively work to make sure that Singapore gets its food from as many countries as possible. Food supply can be affected by not just pandemics. Climate change, global population growth and geopolitical changes could affect supplies from some countries in future.Today, Singapore buys food from over 170 places around the world.“By diversifying our import sources, we avoid being overly-reliant on any single source country and spread the risk of food supply disruption across as many sources as possible,” said Mr Goh Wee Hou, Director of SFA’s Food Supply Resilience Division. “This way, if supply from any source country is disrupted, the impact would be minimised.”How is this done?SFA works with importers to organise overseas sourcing trips and business matching sessions to explore new sources and business opportunities.Their officers also go overseas, to scout for new companies and farms which Singapore can buy food items such as meat and eggs from.Said Mr Goh, “We also work with overseas authorities to accredit as many farms and countries to export to Singapore as possible, as long as they can meet our food safety requirements.”For instance, people in Singapore consume 1.97 billion chicken eggs every year. Since 2016, SFA has worked to increase the number of approved countries for eggs from seven, to 14 today.Was Singapore’s food supply really at risk at the start of COVID-19?No. Because of these efforts, even though there was some panic buying when COVID-19 first struck Singapore, supply of food remained stable.There were some concerns over flow of food imports when Malaysia first announced its Movement Control Order, which restricts the movement of people and goods across its borders.When some importers became worried about their food supplies, SFA officers remained on standby to take their calls and assured them that essential items like food would be allowed to enter Singapore.SFA also worked together with MTI and ESG to monitor the food supply situation, MFA to keep in close touch with regional and international partners, as well as the Customs and the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority to ensure that food supplies move smoothly across the borders to Singapore.At the start of the pandemic, because some air routes were closed, there was also an increase in freight costs to fly in food from some countries, like chilled pork from Australia.Said Mr Ong Xuan Feng, Assistant Director of SFA’s Industry Development & Partnership Division, “This was quickly managed as importers were able to switch to alternate sources where necessary. Later on, the Australia authorities committed to keeping supply lines open through weekly flights.”Can Singapore produce more of the food we consume?That’s the plan. Even though local farmers produce less than 10 percent of the nation’s nutritional needs at the moment, SFA is aiming to increase this to 30 percent by 2030.On this “30 by 30” goal, Mr Goh said, “Although import source diversification has served us well, COVID-19 underscores the importance of having a buffer in case of global supply disruptions.”In fact, because of COVID-19, SFA is accelerating “30 by 30” by putting aside $30 million to give grants to people or businesses in Singapore which can quickly ramp up the production of eggs, leafy vegetables and fish in the next six to 24 months.', 'id': 'adc4c49f-6ee8-4ddf-90fe-63ac96edcf51', 'score': None, 'probability': None, 'question': None, 'meta': {'category': 'articles'}, 'embedding': None},\n",

While the COVID-19 situation in Singapore has come under control, the resulting economic impact on the global and Singaporean economy is severe, and will last for a while.In a Ministerial Statement on 17 August 2020, Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat announced additional measures to help Singaporeans through this crisis. Here’s a summary on the measures to protect workers and jobs:1) Extension of Jobs Support SchemeThe Jobs Support Scheme (JSS), which was launched at the start of the pandemic, helps companies to retain jobs by covering the salary of workers - currently up to August 2020. The JSS will now be extended by up to seven months, covering wages paid up to March 2021.The support given will vary based on the sectors, with hardest-hit sectors like aerospace, aviation and tourism receiving more. Sectors Extension of support under the JSS Aerospace, aviation, tourism sectors 50% of wages paid for seven more months Built environment sector 50% of wages paid for two more months, before lowering to 30% for wages paid up to March 2021 Arts and entertainment, food services, land transport, marine and offshore, and retail sectors 30% of wages paid for seven more months For the large majority of the remaining sectors 10% of wages paid for seven more months For the few sectors that are managing well, such as biomedical sciences, financial services, and ICT sectors 10% of wages paid for four more months, for wages paid up to December 2020 2) Jobs Growth IncentiveTo help sectors that are doing well - such as the biomedical sciences, financial services, and ICT sectors - create new jobs for workers, the Jobs Growth Incentive (JGI) will support firms in hiring of local workers. The Government will co-pay up to 25% of salaries of all new local hires for one year, subject to a cap. For those aged 40 and above, the co-payment to firms will be up to 50%. 3) Extension of the COVID-19 Support Grant to Dec 2020The COVID-19 Support Grant was introduced earlier in May to help Singaporeans who are unemployed or suffered significant income loss. The grant will now be extended to December 2020. From October 2020, both existing recipients and new applicants can apply for the grant. Unemployed applicants must demonstrate job search or training efforts to qualifyThe Ministry of Social and Family Development will share more details in early September.4) Extension of Workfare Special PaymentFor the earlier announced $3,000 Workfare Special Payment, the eligibility criteria will be widened. Those who were not on Workfare last year but have received or will be receiving Workfare for work done this year will be eligible as well.

       " {'text': \"siblings sew and donate over 300 masks to the needy It all started when 16-year-old Beatrice Wong picked up a newspaper article some time in early 2020, which reported a shortage of disposable masks.She had also been having discussions with her family about the long lines outside pharmacies, with people looking to purchase masks. *This was prior to the Government's three mask distribution exercises. Read more here.The Secondary 4 student from Greendale Secondary immediately thought about those who would have difficulty affording the face coverings, such as low-income families.Reusable masks would come in handy for them, she thought.And she quickly got to work. Fortunately, Beatrice had picked up sewing skills from her grandmother since she was 12 – in fact, she had previously started a little home-based outfit called “My Ah Ma’s Attic”, which sold items like pouches and pencil cases that she had lovingly stitched together.She chuckles, “I’m very skinny in person, so all my uniforms and skirts were always very loose. I would ask my grandma to mend it and make them tighter so they would fit me.“My grandma was the one who passed her sewing skills to me so that I would be able to do it all myself, and I can pass this skill on to future generations.”But sewing reusable masks was quite something altogether. Sewing masks from scratchAs any other young personwould, she first turned to YouTube to figure out the steps to making a fabric mask.“I learnt that you first needed to trace the template on the fabric, then cut it out. You assemble it together and then use clips to make sure they don’t fly away. The final step is to sew the sides and add the strings so that the users can wear it comfortably,” she explains.The fabric she uses comes from a variety of places. Some came from bedsheets or clothes they decided to upcycle, while others were from a “stash of fabrics we like to buy and hoard at home”, laughs Beatrice’s mum, Brenda Lin, a homemaker. Beatrice admits that she’s got a perfectionist side – “If the lines are not straight, I would want to pick them out and sew them again. If it’s perfect for the first time, I can get a mask done in 20 minutes, otherwise it can be half an hour to 1 hour!”Together with her brother, Adriel, 12, and their mum Brenda, the Wong family has made over 300 reusable masks since January this year. More time during the Circuit BreakerIt’s no mean feat – especially since the Wong siblings both have major national examinations this year.Beatrice is doing her ‘O’-levels, and Adriel is doing his PSLE. But the period of Home-Based learning during the Circuit Breaker gave them the extra time – and push – they needed.“We couldn’t do the outdoor activities that we used to, so the next best thing was to do something unrelated to studying, something not from their textbooks. It’s a different type of classroom learning for them,” says Brenda.For one, Beatrice learnt the value of patience.“By nature, I’m quite impatient, so I like to get things done quick and fast. But I realised thtat doing it fast would cause me to make mistakes. The lines won’t be straight, or I would forget to change the colour of the thread, causing me to have to redo it,” she says.But making masks during their downtime was something that both Beatrice and Adriel embraced.Notes Beatrice, “We have a schedule at home to follow, so during breaktime, instead of wasting time, sitting down there using my phone, why not use that time to do something even more meaningful, which is making those masks for those in need.” It’s not Beatrice’s first foray into helping others in the community.She also does volunteer work with charity organisation Helping Joy, assisting beneficiaries to de-clutter and clean up their homes, enabling them to live comfortably.“Before COVID-19, the volunteers would sometimes bring the beneficiaries out, befriend them and make them happy. Now we can’t really do these things as some of them are quite old and are more vulnerable if they contract the virus,” she says, adding that making masks for them is one way she can continue supporting them.Charity begins at homeFor the Wongs, giving back to the community is part and parcel of life, with the family frequently volunteering with ground-up initiatives since Beatrice was 12. Brenda shares her thoughts, “As parents, we are our children's first teachers. Knowledge can be gained from books, but values can only be learnt from home. “My husband and I firmly believe that some experiences and lessons cannot be taught in books.”She adds that she often reminds her children that all national exams are just a checkpoint. “Their lives and futures are not determined by a few numbers. It is the values and the attitude that will set their future path.”Taking the first stepWhile Beatrice admits that there aren’t many of her friends who are as keen on volunteering as she is, she feels it is a matter of just taking the first step.“I think they are keen, but they don’t really dare. They are scared, they don’t know what the consequences are,” she explains. For instance, some of them might have had experiences where they tried to help an elderly person, but the elderly person may have snapped back that he or she doesn’t really need the help, Beatrice adds. “That could be what’s holding them back.”She urges other youth like her to just give it a shot.“It doesn’t hurt to make the first move to help those in need. What you receive is beyond gratification. Step out of your comfort zones. You’ll be surprised that your hard work has paid off.She smiles, “After all these experiences, I can say that I’m proud of who I’ve become.”This article is part of a series of stories of Singaporean youth who have come forward to help the community, during this fight against COVID-19.Many have stepped up during this time to help Singapore overcome COVID-19.For more stories of youths who embody the #SGUnited spirit: The Beng who feeds the hungry Self-taught engineer puts in 200 hours repairing laptops for those in need Avid volunteer delivered meals to 500 families Find out how you can do your part for the community: sgunited.gov.sg\", 'id': 'a68eeec0-c428-426f-bb77-a4c502586034', 'score': None, 'probability': None, 'question': None, 'meta': {'category': 'articles'}, 'embedding': None},\n",
       " {'text': \"20 year old self taught engineer puts in 200 hours repairing laptops for those in need When home-based learning was introduced during the circuit breaker period, there was an urgent need to ensure that students from low-income households could access working laptops.While the Ministry of Education loaned out more than 12,000 laptops and tablets (as of April 15 2020) to students who did not have sufficient devices at home, other groups in the community stepped up as well.One of these was Engineering Good – a non-profit committed to engineering solutions for the local community.It started with an innocuous Facebook post appealing for donations of laptops for a beneficiary. Soon enough, replies started streaming in – tens, then hundreds – and the phone was ringing off the hook with requests and donations. The Engineering Good team buckled down to cope with the demand.20-year-old volunteer Darin Lobo, a diploma graduate in biomedical science and a self-taught engineer, was in the thick of it.“It went crazy at the start,” Darin says, recounting the first two weeks of laptop repairs. “I would work 14 hours continuously for about three to four days, then take a break and come back to it.” Engineering for the good of the communityDarin’s journey with engineering started when he was just 11 years old, after joining the maker community in Singapore. Through the community, he connected with like-minded individuals who were interested in building things, from websites to apps, with prototype tools like 3D printers, all in a Do-It-Yourself setting.He slowly picked up electronics and engineering skills, learning from other members as he went along.A friend then introduced him to Engineering Good, which started as a passion project to engineer solutions for the less fortunate. Some projects the organisation has worked on include low cost assistive switches for people with conditions such as cerebral palsy and muscular dystrophy.Then, the COVID-19 situation hit.In order to stem the spread of the virus, home-based learning was introduced in all schools in Singapore.The Engineering Good team stepped up to fill the need for laptops in the homes of students – particularly those from low-income housholds.Thus the initiative Computers Against COVID was born.Heart for hardwareDarin and team quickly set about repairing the donated computers: updating software, fixing hardware issues, installing the programmes required for home-based learning, and ensuring quality control.The computers are then sent to the various beneficiaries through social workers, who assign them to those who need them the most.The initial days were the most challenging for Darin. It was demoralising when multiple computers could not be fixed, and the mental exhaustion of doing repetitive tasks wore Darin out.However, he soon learnt to pace himself and work sustainably. Futhermore, a helping hand was always near. When faced with a seemingly unsolvable problem, a WhatsApp message to the Engineering Good group would generate many ideas and solutions.These past two months, Engineering Good has repaired and delivered over 2,000 computers.100 volunteers, from different walks of life, undertake all manner of tasks from repairs to delivery and liaison with social workers.Darin estimates that he has spent about 200 hours repairing laptops, a number he humbly dismisses as “not much of a big deal”. Knowing that these repaired laptops would benefit someone makes all the difficulties worth it. “It's an extremely tiny sacrifice taken by me. If I spend just an hour fixing a computer, that computer may help improve the life of an individual or family for potentially years,” he adds.“Initially, you're just repairing laptops, looking at pieces of hardware and you don't really think about the impact,” he says.“But after that, a lot of people send us 'thank you' notes and pictures of themselves with their laptops. That's when you start seeing that there is actually a significant impact there.”Inspired by maker communityThrough his time in the maker community attending events, as well as volunteering with Engineering Good, Darin says that the community around him inspires and motivates him.In the maker community, Darin has met “hundreds of people who are doing little things [to give back to the community] here and there”.Asked about who he’s looked up to while serving the community, he quips that he has “too many role models” and has simply met “too many interesting people” to speak about in the span of an interview.Of his experience working on Computers Against COVID, he says, “It is quite inspiring that so many people are taking time from their busy lives to work on this effort. It is also great that this effort fosters so much teamwork.” Not stopping just yetEngineering Good isn’t stopping there. They are now looking to turn Computers Against COVID from a spontaneous effort to something more continuous and sustainable.In addition, they intend to educate people on how to repair computers, and to supply computers not just for home-based learning, but for all who need them.Darin is not stopping either, despite confessing that he has “too many hobbies” and “multiple projects going on at the same time”. On top of his work with Engineering Good, he is also on standby as a COVID-19 swabber under MOH, while waiting to enlist in National Service.Still, volunteering ranks high on his priorities. “It's quite hard to not be motivated when you can make such a difference with a relatively small amount of effort,” he says. To other youths looking to give back to society, he urges, “Learn to both enjoy the task you are doing as well as the meaning behind it. It will serve to motivate you.”This article is part of a series of stories of Singaporean youth who have come forward to help the community, during this fight against COVID-19.

       " {'text': 'consultancy a dynamic industry on the rise If you think that it’s too late in your career to change industries, a chat with 36-year-old Zen Lye, a senior associate at PwC Singapore, might just change your mind.Previously an assistant manager in the construction industry, Zen made the switch toconsultancy, so that he could pursue his passion for new technologies.Following a dreamMoving into the world of consultancy work was something that Zen had never expected. But it must have been kismet, that his work in construction got him involved in the development of PwC’s Experience Centre – a centralised location that combines experimental, technical and creative resources to create an immersive experience for consulting. “What I learnt about Experience Centre intrigued me and I wanted to learn more,” says Zen, who then applied for a consulting role at PwC.Zen Lye at the South East Asian Experience Centre in Singapore Transferable skills in managing projectsWhat he lacked in consultancy experience, Zen made up for in transferrable skills in project and stakeholder management. “When I was in construction, I had to manage several projects and many different stakeholders at the same time,” Zen explains. The project management and communication skills he gained in construction proved to be useful in his current role, which requires him to juggle multiple projects. PwC Singapore also valued Zen’s earnest attitude towards learning, and his passion for technology.From implementing to creating solutions It was a shift that Zen desired – instead of implementing existing solutions like lighting and CCTVs, he could now move to what’s known as “iterative solutioning”, where he was involved in the creation of a brand-new product, testing it, and revising it for the next versions. To bridge the gap in skills required for his new role in consulting, PwC Singapore placed him in a year-long Professional Conversion Programme for Consultants. The programme enabled him to acquire new skills not just in consultancy, but also 3D Modelling, 3D printing as well as Python Programming. These skills would come in useful in building prototypes for new products in his area of work.Potential for consultancy growth in technology and cybersecurityDespite the current COVID-19 climate, major consulting firms have seen growing demand for technology and cybersecurity expertise. Opportunities in the professional services sector Consultancy is part of the growing professional services sector. Since April 2020, 9,000 opportunities for jobseekers have been curated in professsional services. For job opportunities in professional services, click here. For instance, PwC’s Experience Centre team began developing a contact tracer in light of the pandemic. Inspired by the centre’s Bluetooth enabled access-controlled system, the tracer enables social distance monitoring using a low energy beacon, and it’s currently deployed in Singapore, Australia and Luxembourg. Zen says he is especially glad about how the contact tracer has contributed to the fight against the pandemic. “The tracer was piloted in a foreign worker dormitory to help the organisation understand the possibilities of infections in confined locations, and also at a healthcare institution to ensure compliance to safe management measures,” he says.Stepping out of one’s comfort zone and being global-readyWith the COVID-19 pandemic affecting large sectors of the economy, both businesses and workers need to be agile and adapt to the current environment.All the more reason that one should “continue to push oneself, and be ready to try new things by stepping outside your comfort zone,” advises Zen. One way that employees can do this, to seize the chance to gain market knowledge through internships and overseas work opportunities. Mao Zheng, a Senior Associate in Capital Projects and Infrastructure at PwC, was on secondment to Yangon, Myanmar, from September 2019 to March 2020.Mao Zheng, during his secondment to Myanmar Besides relishing his visits to Mandalay, the ancient capital city of Myanmar, Mao had first-hand updates on project developments there, as well as face-to-face meetings with local clients and partners. “Being physically on the ground provided me with a good understanding of business norms in Myanmar” he explains. Sharing similar sentiments is Yi-chung Tay, Asia co-CEO of marketing and communications company VMLY&R, who feels that employees stand to benefit from having overseas work experience. Having worked in China for 15 years at companies like PepsiCo and VMLY&R, Tay shares that “it’s great to be in such a large market, as the stakes are very high.”While working overseas “gives you a certain perspective on dealing with uncertainty and change,” Tay admits that it took a while for him to acclimatise to a different cultural context. But he got used to it – albeit a bit too well in some areas. He chuckles, “My friends say I now drive much more aggressively.” Nurturing Local Talents for Global Aspirations The Global Ready Talent Programme (GRT) aims to develop global-ready local talent for Singaporean enterprises to expand both locally and globally. Through internships and overseas work opportunities, Singaporeans will be equipped with market knowledge to navigate the different challenges in overseas markets. To find out more, click here. Strength in difference Singaporeans are well equipped to work overseas – “we are bilingual, and work in a cosmopolitan environment,” says Tay. Many local companies have a strong regional presence, offering Singaporeans opportunities to be seconded overseas. For Mao, working overseas is a “great opportunity to learn and grow, both in and out of work.” Now back in Singapore, he is confident that he can apply the knowledge and leverage relationships he made in Myanmar for projects in South East Asia. Mr Tay agrees, “You gain a heightened awareness, and an ability to handle different perspectives.”', 'id': 'c7adcd7e-4a35-4e0a-ba2d-096a8773890c', 'score': None, 'probability': None, 'question': None, 'meta': {'category': 'articles'}, 'embedding': None},\n",

It is false that there were 1,146 new cases. There was no instruction given by the Minister for Health or the Government to halve or under-report the number of cases. For the purpose of updating the number of new cases of COVID-19 per 24-hour period, MOH has always used 12pm as the cut-off time since the onset of COVID-19. There is no cover-up by the Government or MOH. MOH’s daily press releases publish information on all confirmed cases, including the number of imported cases, and the linked and unlinked cases at that point in time, even as contact tracing and epidemiological investigations are ongoing.

       " {'text': \"how is singapore limiting the spread of covid 19 The Ministry of Health has been monitoring the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) situation in Singapore closely.Several measures have been put in place to limit the spread of the virus in Singapore: Cessation of flights from Wuhan Since 23 Jan 2020, all inbound flights from Wuhan, China have ceased. In addition, Singaporeans are advised to defer all travel to Hubei province and non-essential travel to Mainland China. Screening at checkpoints Temperature screening is being done at all land, air and sea checkpoints. Travellers on all flights into Singapore will have to undergo temperature screening. For passengers from China, healthcare teams will be stationed nearby as passengers alight from the planes. Signboards at aerobridges direct travellers who feel unwell, or who have recently been to Hubei to these healthcare teams, to receive medical attention if necessary. Compulsory Leave of Absence (LOA) Returning Singapore Citizens, PRs and long-term visa holders will be placed under a 14-day Leave of Absence. The LOA will start from the day after their arrival in Singapore. Persons put on LOA should stay at home and avoid social contact. They should monitor their health closely, and seek medical attention immediately if they develop any fever or symptomsof acute respiratory illness, such as cough or shortness of breath. Mandatory quarantine for travellers to Hubei All recent travellers to Hubei will be quarantined. These include: Recent travellers to Hubei already in Singapore; Returning residents of Singapore, or long-term pass holders with travel history to Hubei or with China passports issued in Hubei; There are severe penalties for not complying with quarantine orders. Travel restrictions to Mainland China All visitors (regardless of nationality) who travelled to Mainland China in the last 14 days will not be allowed entry into, or transit through Singapore. A visa suspension for PRC passport holders, effective immediately. Previously issued visas will be suspended. Returning Singapore citizens, PRs and long-term pass holders will be placed under a 14-day Leave of Absence. Watch Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong's announcement on 1 Feb 2020 on the extension of travel restrictions to minimize risk of community spread.For more information on the precautionary measures that the Government is taking, go to Update: In light of the human-to-human transmission cases, Singapore has implemented enhanced measures in addition to the above.\", 'id': 'ac0d85fc-0798-4bcd-8744-c35f326976f1', 'score': None, 'probability': None, 'question': None, 'meta': {'category': 'articles'}, 'embedding': None},\n",
       " {'text': \"keeping a safe distance can lower the spread of covid 19 Many confirmed COVID-19 cases in Singapore so far were transmitted during social activities and gatherings, with individuals continuing with daily activities even though they were unwell.What can we do to protect ourselves? Answer: Take safe d i s t a n c i n g seriously.The idea is simple – to maintain a distance between yourself and others and minimise physical interactions. By doing so and reducing gathering in close proximitywith crowds, we can slow down the transmission chain and flatten the epidemic curve. This is the best way to contain and prevent community spread as it can serve as a circuit breaker.The WHO has advised to maintain at least one metre distance between yourself and anyone who is sneezing and coughing. That’s because when someone coughs or sneezes, they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain the virus.In your day to day No more handshakes – try an elbow bump, an air five or any other preferred way of greeting, as long as it is contactless. Now is the time to enjoy your personal space. Keep a 1m separation from others, in places like restaurants, theatres or queues.At work Do you really need that face-to-face meeting with 15 other colleagues? Teleconference and telecommute whenever you can. Grab the chance to enjoy emptier trains and buses – commute at off-peak hours if you can.For retail and F&B businesses Queues may be good for businesses, but physical crowding isn’t when it comes to safe distancing. Here's what you can do to avoid that: Reduce the number of people in queues by using queue management systems. If need be, space customers out in the queue. Use mobile payment or pre-ordering methods to avoid queues at the cashier. Encourage use of self-checkouts, cashless and contactless payment.

       " {'text': 'minister chan chun sing making a living in a covid 19 world COVID-19 has impacted our lives, livelihoods and lifelines, and aggravated already difficult global challenges. Singapore is not immune. Many Singaporeans have lost their jobs, and more job losses are expected in the coming months. Some businesses have closed, and many others are struggling. We cannot save every job and every business, but we will take care of every Singaporean. We will not let widespread unemployment erode the confidence and dignity of our people. This Government has committed almost a hundred billion dollars to care for every Singaporean, help businesses and save jobs. Our immediate focus is jobs. We will create a hundred thousand jobs and training opportunities in the next year, to help those coming out from schools, as well as those retrenched. We will invest to develop our intangible strengths – what distinguishes us; our infrastructure – for they are key enablers; and above all, our people and businesses. We will work hard to make sure everyone who wants a job, can get a job. For businesses affected by Covid, we will help you to get ready to rebound when the economy picks up. The Government’s commitment to our workers and businesses remains unchanged. We will ensure that every member of Team Singapore shares the benefits of growth. We can be confident in our future. Our promise is this: We will create opportunities for all Singaporeans, no matter how old you are, to improve your lives at every stage of your careers.

We will build a better Singapore together, where our future generations have the pride, the means, and the gumption to be called, Singaporeans.Full transcript:Fellow Singaporeans, COVID-19 has impacted our lives, livelihoods and lifelines, and it has aggravated already difficult global challenges. Trade and investments have come down. People and businesses in many countries have lost confidence in globalisation and technology. They have been disrupted, and their Governments have been unable to help them adjust. Bigger countries have been fighting over the tax revenues of global companies, and that has affected international competition for investments and jobs.Countries are all doing their best to keep people safe and healthy, secure essential items, such as food and medicine, save jobs and businesses in the face of severe decline in demand and investments.Singapore is not immune. Many Singaporeans have already lost their jobs. More job losses are expected in the coming months. Others have seen their incomes fall. It will be a tough job market in the coming years. Some businesses have closed. Many more are struggling. Most wonder how to survive, never mind thrive. This Government has committed almost a hundred billion dollars to care for every Singaporean, help save businesses and jobs. But it is not just about spending money. What is even more important is our ability to plan, adapt and execute.This is how we will do it.Immediate PrioritiesOur immediate focus is jobs. We will create one hundred thousand jobs and training opportunities in the coming year. The range of jobs will include healthcare, early childhood education, transport, ICT and financial services. 100,000 jobs – that is three times our usual annual number. This is how many we will need, to help those coming out from schools, as well as those retrenched. We may well need to create more jobs, if the situation worsens.We will also increase the capacity of our training institutions to equip more workers, especially mid-career ones, with new skills required for the new economy. This help will come to where you are. We will set up job centres in every town to match displaced workers to new jobs. We will work hard to make sure everyone who wants a job can get a job.Many say the best way to save jobs is to resume our economic activities more quickly. I understand. But opening up hastily and closing businesses again if infections spike once more, will be more disruptive to businesses and workers. Hence, let us resume safely, progressively and sustainably.Even after reopening, we should not expect ‘business-as-usual’. Some businesses will need to change their business models. We will help you to redesign your operations and serve new markets. Many F&B businesses like SaladStop and Beauty in the Pot have launched delivery-friendly menus to serve new customers. Others still have viable business models. We will help you to rebound when demand picks up. We will support you to hire and train graduates and mid-career workers in advance. Logistics and professional services are examples of sectors where we are starting to do this.Longer Term GoalsAs we tackle the immediate challenges, we must also prepare for the future. The Future Economy Council, chaired by DPM Heng, has been driving this for the last few years.We will invest to develop our intangible strengths – what distinguishes us; our infrastructure – for they are key enablers; and above all, our people and businesses.Intangible StrengthsFirst, our intangible strengths. Over the years, many investors have chosen to site and expand their businesses here, in Singapore. They did not make this decision for the short-term, nor did they choose Singapore because we have abundant natural resources, or because we are cheaper. They chose us because of our strengths, which are not easy to replicate elsewhere. We are open, and connected with the world, we are trusted, we are united and stable as a society, and we have a skilled workforce.For many countries, COVID-19 has accelerated the retreat from globalisation, and the erection of more protectionist barriers. Even in a more protectionist, less connected world, we can still make a living and more. We can build capabilities to play critical roles in global supply chains to produce high quality products and services that others value. For example, we make four out of the world’s top ten drugs, we are the world’s seventh largest exporter of chemicals.Our resilience comes from building networks, and diversifying our supply sources and markets. We will never be able to have everything we would possibly need, for the next crisis. Indeed, when lockdowns started across the world three months ago, many of our supply chains were disrupted, if not broken. Credit goes to the ingenuity and tenacity of our people for keeping us going. Our public and private sectors swung into action, reached out to their networks, opened new supply lines to bring back essentials like masks, PPE and test reagents from across the world.Individuals from PSA, SIA, SATS, ST Logistics, NTUC, Sheng Siong and many more. Without all these unsung heroes, we would not have been able to live our lives as normally as we did in the last few months. Thank you all!Another intangible strength is trust. Singapore is trusted globally. Throughout this crisis, we have also continued to show the world they can trust Singapore. We did not impose export restrictions or nationalise foreign investments. We kept our production lines open for global supply chains, including critical materials for surgical masks. We worked with companies to increase their production, so that we could meet Singapore’s and the world’s needs, and we facilitated the continued flow of essential goods and people through our ports and airports.In uncertain times, our trusted brand counts for even more. Businesses have noticed. When they make their next investments to diversify their global production bases, we will be in the running. Just as how we did not restrict exports during the 1970s oil crises – that enhanced our credibility later to establish Jurong Island as a global petrochemical hub.Our investors have stood by us through this difficult period. We know the challenges investors face, with manpower flows and family reunions. We will work closely with you to overcome the challenges together. We will keep faith with you, as you have with us.We will work to stay connected with the world, even as the world threatens to fragment and regress towards protectionism. Despite our size, we can show the way, if we have good ideas. When promoting free trade, our initial partnerships with Brunei, Chile, and New Zealand eventually grew to become today’s CPTPP.Together with New Zealand, we issued a Joint Ministerial Statement to resist export restrictions and uphold global supply chains. From a party of two, we now have eleven subscriber countries, and counting.We are building a network of Digital Economy partnerships. The partnerships will define the rules for competing and cooperating in the new economy. They will create opportunities for our companies to grow their overseas markets. We have concluded such agreements with Australia, Chile and New Zealand. More are on the way.Barring unforeseen circumstances, we look forward to signing the RCEP agreement this year. This will cover all 10 ASEAN member states, plus Australia, China, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea. It will lower the cost of imports for our consumers, and exports for our producers.These agreements and other FTAs open up new opportunities for our businesses, and will make us a more attractive base for investments to serve the region. This will signal to the world our confidence and determination to press on with regional economic integration.Together with our trade association partners, we will translate these trade agreements into tangible advantages for our companies, through platforms like GlobalConnect@SBF.InfrastructureSecond, as we develop our intangible strengths, we will invest in the next generation of infrastructure for Singapore. We will press on to build our connectivity infrastructure to reinforce our position as a choice hub for business, finance, trade and data flows. This is why I am here today at our port, which is the heart of our trade connections to the world.Our long-term plans remain sound. They include projects like Changi T5, Tuas Mega Port, and submarine cable hubs. Likewise, regional developments like Punggol Digital District, Jurong Lake District, Sungei Kadut Eco-District, Greater Southern Waterfront. We will pace the timelines for these projects according to demand. But do not doubt this: We will get them all done. Together, they will create a vibrant and innovative Singapore for our children – full of opportunities, full of life.We will also intensify the efforts to attract the best ideas and talent to compete on our side, and complement our strengths. Initiatives like the Global Innovation Alliance connect us with talent hubs across the world. We will make ourselves a more attractive safe harbour for talent, ideas and intellectual property, to grow more businesses and create better jobs. Competition is intense. Talented people, including our own, can go anywhere.I know many Singaporeans are concerned with foreign competition, but closing ourselves up is not the answer. We cannot escape competing with the world, and proving our mettle. We will give our workers the training and support to excel, and we will ensure that the competition is fair. This is the best way to improve the wellbeing of our people.Our Businesses and PeopleFinally, beyond investments in intangibles and infrastructure, this Government will ensure that every member of Team Singapore shares the benefits of growth.Let me highlight two efforts: digitalisation, and internationalisation.COVID-19 has pushed many businesses and consumers to embrace the digital world. The digital trajectory will only accelerate, and not reverse. We must enable every Singaporean, young and old; every business, big and small, to go digital and thrive. Companies will embrace digital tools to create new business models and transcend our local market constraints. For example, STB is helping our hospitality companies and event organisers to overcome the collapse in travel demand by using digital tools. One event organiser – WiT or Web In Travel – is engaging global audiences though a virtual travel summit later this month, across different countries.In the 1980s, we uplifted a generation through computerisation and automation. In the 2020s, we will transform another generation through digitalisation and data, and not just the young in high-tech companies. We are building a thousand-strong Digital Ambassador Corps to help small and micro enterprises apply digitalisation, and help senior citizens to learn to use the technology.But helping businesses access new markets must go beyond the digital online to establish real partnerships in the real world. Many Singapore businesses have established regional and global presence in the past years, often in partnerships. The more established and larger companies help newcomers and smaller businesses. For example, CapitaLand brings along Singapore companies in its overseas development projects, thus helping them to penetrate new markets. The retail and hospitality sector may be going through a challenging time, but CapitaLand will press on and do more to support our local SMEs.We will step up such efforts to nurture a new generation of regional and global businesses. We will facilitate more industry partnerships, including in the digital space, like how Singapore E-Biz and Alliance 21 are helping local food manufacturers drive international business. Likewise, we will better organise our overseas Singapore business chapters and missions to guide newcomers venturing overseas.Our business leaders and workers will be key to these efforts. We must have the aptitude and attitude to serve global markets. Our people must have the entrepreneurial spirit to venture abroad to compete, and seize the opportunities of a fast-growing Asia. We cannot be content with doing well just within Singapore. We introduced Scale-Up SG to groom promising local companies into global champions. So long as our companies have the ambition, we will find the resources to support them.We will intensify the overseas exposure of our people, through initiatives like the Global Ready Talent Programme, so that they gain fresh perspectives and networks. That is what we did for many students, including Carousell co-founder Siu Rui, Marcus, and Lucas. They spent a year in Silicon Valley, as part of the NUS Overseas Colleges programme. This laid the foundation and gave them the confidence to later launch Carousell, which their team has grown beyond Singapore to eight markets across Southeast Asia today. We will scale up such opportunities for our people.Earlier this year, MOE announced our ‘70-70’ target to enable more students from institutes of higher learning to gain overseas exposure. 70 per cent of IHL students to have an overseas exposure, 70 per cent to focus on China, India and ASEAN. We will press on with this once the COVID-19 situation allows.We will never be done upskilling our people. This is especially so for workers who have left school many years ago and did not benefit from the more recent improvements in our education and training system. Confidence for the FutureWe can be confident that our investments in our strengths, our infrastructure, and our people are all coming together. This is why in the first four months of this year, EDB has already captured 13 billion dollars of investment commitments, from companies like ExxonMobil, Micron, and ST Microelectronics, and some companies continue to hire and grow their businesses, like Innosparks, Secretlab, and Shopee.Even though the outlook for the next few years is uncertain, investors maintain their confidence in Singapore to base their new and exciting projects here. For example, Hyundai will be setting up their Mobility Global Innovation Centre in Jurong. It will be a next-generation innovation and manufacturing platform incorporating Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things, and robotics to produce electric vehicles of the future. When ready in 2022, it will create many new and exciting opportunities for our workers.Our local companies are confident too. In my regular visits to our local companies, I have seen many big and small companies in different sectors actively transforming their businesses, such as Prima, Hai Sia Seafood, and Markono Print Media. What cheered me most is that they have upskilled their workforce in the process. They didn’t leave the workers behind. ConclusionOur Pioneer and Merdeka Generations built our economy from scratch. They laid our strong foundations, brick by brick – Changi Airport, HDB flats, MRT lines, SIA, DBS, PSA and many more. In fact, they moved us from Third World to First in one generation, and saved enough to set aside reserves for future generations.They showed us what it means to be Singaporean. That while we are not of common ancestry, race, language or religion, we are defined by our determination to chart our own destiny, guided by the values of openness, inclusiveness, self-determination, meritocracy and incorruptibility for us to defy the odds of history, and not only survive but thrive with the world as our hinterland and our markets.55 years on, we are better positioned to keep Singapore going, growing and glowing. We will build a better Singapore together, where our future generations have the pride, the means, and the gumption to be called Singaporeans.….From 7 to 20 June 2020, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat, Senior Ministers Teo Chee Hean and Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Minister Chan Chun Sing and Minister Lawrence Wong will deliver a series of national broadcasts, explaining what a post-COVID-19 future looks like for Singapore.Clickherefor the other speeches.', 'id': 'c3664d17-03e2-45ed-95ca-6940975fc81a', 'score': None, 'probability': None, 'question': None, 'meta': {'category': 'articles'}, 'embedding': None},\n",

Therefore, we have embarked on a phased approach to re-open safely. We are not going back to life before Circuit Breaker; the majority of our population have not been exposed to COVID-19 and are still vulnerable. We must be cautious in our re-opening. We will continue to monitor the situation in Phase 1, and we will be able to move to Phase 2 before end-June if conditions remain stable. But we must be mentally prepared to see more cases as we open up. The key is whether we can keep community rates stable. During Circuit Breaker, we increased our capacity and speed of contact tracing and expanding testing capacity. This will help allow business and life to resume progressively. Singapore is part of the massive global effort to develop a vaccine – an important part of the longer-term solution. But it will take a long time, and the virus is not likely to go away. We must adapt to COVID-19, learn to live with it over the long-term. We have to change the way we live and work – urban planning will need to cater to flexible work arrangements, companies will have to find safer ways to deliver products and services. COVID-19 has brought out the best in Singaporeans. Individuals and businesses have been going the extra mile, looking out for the vulnerable and those in need. This is the Singapore spirit that gives us confidence to press ahead, and which will see us through this crisis of our generation.Full transcript:My fellow Singaporeans,Good evening.COVID-19 is the most serious health crisis the world has faced in a century.We have all seen the devastating effects of the virus worldwide. When the outbreak gets out of control, the spike in cases can quickly overwhelm the healthcare system. Many people will not get the care they need, and the number of deaths will rise sharply.We are determined to avoid the same fate in Singapore.That’s why we’ve been going all out to control the spread of the virus, and to ensure that our healthcare system is able to care for all who are infected.It has been a tough fight against a formidable and invisible enemy. We’ve had our share of challenges. But we faced them head-on.Working together we’ve stabilised the situation in the migrant worker dormitories. We’ve brought down community cases significantly. We’ve protected our seniors, and kept our fatality rates low. Most of all, I’d like to acknowledge all our officers serving on the frontline, including our healthcare professionals and volunteers. I’m speaking today at the NCID, the National Centre for Infectious Diseases, which has been at the forefront of this battle.You have all been working flat out, making sacrifices and exceeding the call of duty. So to all of you, I want to say a big Thank You.The strict measures and restrictions we’ve imposed over the recent months have been effective.But they come at a high price. We’re cushioning the impact on our businesses and workers with four Budget packages this year.But we cannot remain closed indefinitely as we have to prioritise both lives and livelihoods. The vast majority of our population have not been exposed to the virus and are still vulnerable to the disease. We want to continue to provide maximum protection for our seniors and those with medical conditions. Hence we have been very cautious in our re-opening.We are now in Phase 1 and we will continue to monitor the situation over the coming week. If the conditions remain stable, we will be able to move into Phase 2 before the end of the month.We will then resume a broader range of activities, covering nearly the whole economy, and allow social interactions and family visits in small groups of not more than 5 people.Externally, we are carefully easing travel restrictions and re-opening our borders, by creating “green lanes” with selected countries. These arrangements will be limited to essential travel for work reasons, and tight controls will be put in place.When conditions permit, we will extend “green lanes” to more countries, and to non-business travellers. But it will take a while before we see international air travel recovering in a significant way, or before we can open up for mass market travel.As we resume more activities, there will be more human contact and more opportunities for the virus to spread. So we must be mentally prepared to see more new cases.This has happened in many other places which exited from their lockdowns, and we must expect it to happen here too. Our ability to control the infection during this process of re-opening is therefore critical. And that’s why we’ve made use of the two months of circuit breaker to do two things.First, we’ve increased our capacity and speed of contact tracing by developing new systems. We have expanded our contact tracing teams, which now include personnel from the Police and the SAF.We are also using technology to speed up contact tracing. We have implemented the SafeEntry digital check-in/check-out system, and the TraceTogether app on smart phones. With these enhancements, we can now identify close contacts faster, isolate them, and prevent large clusters from forming.Beyond TraceTogether and SafeEntry, we are currently developing wearable Bluetooth devices. These will work on their own without the need for a phone. You can conveniently wear or carry them around, as you go about your daily activities. Second, we’ve expanded our testing capacity hugely. We are procuring more test-kits, building more laboratory capacity, and recruiting and training more laboratory technicians as well as personnel to carry out swabs and take blood samples.In early April, we were doing about 2,000 tests a day. Now, we are able to conduct about 13,000 tests a day, and we are on track to reach 40,000 tests a day in the coming months.This expanded testing capacity is critical. It means that we can test higher-risk groups more extensively. We can also do more surveillance testing in the community, including those with respiratory symptoms. This will give us a faster and more accurate sense of the number of cases circulating undetected.Besides the standard testing methods, we are deploying other means of detection.For example, we are extracting waste water from manholes to test for viral fragments. This provides an additional indicator to tell us if a specific group, such as those living in a dormitory, has infected people amongst them.We are also using serology tests – these help to identify those who were previously infected but may have since recovered, and have developed antibodies in response that can help them fight the virus.Aggressive testing and contact tracing will improve our ability to control the spread of the virus. They will help greatly in allowing business and life to resume progressively.In the longer-term, an important part of the solution is a vaccine.The good news is that there is a massive global effort to develop a vaccine. And Singapore is working on this too.We have a pharmaceutical industry, and research capabilities in biomedical science. EDB is also discussing with pharmaceutical companies to manufacture vaccines in Singapore. In parallel, clinicians and researchers around the world, including teams from Singapore, are working hard to develop drugs and other therapies to reduce the severity of the disease.But drug and vaccine development is very challenging work. There is no guarantee that the drugs currently undergoing clinical trials will be effective. And despite the intensive international efforts, it will take a long time for any vaccine to be ready and available for mass distribution.So we have to be realistic and gird ourselves for more challenging times. It is not likely that the virus will go away. Our population will be vulnerable for a long time, in a world where COVID-19 is all around us. What’s critical is people’s behaviour and mindsets. We must stay disciplined and vigilant, and not let our guard down. We must practise social responsibility in upholding good personal hygiene and safe distancing measures – wash our hands regularly, wear a mask wherever we go, avoid big gatherings and crowded places, and see a doctor immediately when we are sick.We’ve been emphasising all this for some time. But it bears repeating, because individually, these are steps everyone can take to protect ourselves and our loved ones.And collectively, these actions will make all the difference in keeping COVID-19 at bay. They will enable us to have a safe and sustainable re-opening, as we have seen in countries like Denmark and New Zealand. Conversely, if we are lax in our personal precautions, new cases and new clusters will multiply quickly, and despite our best efforts to test and trace, we might end up in another circuit breaker down the road.So please cooperate with the restrictions, and keep everyone safe.We also have to change the way we live and work.COVID-19 has precipitated a shift towards more flexible work arrangements. Working from home, staggered work hours, and split team arrangements are becoming more of the norm.Our urban plans will need to cater to these new demands. Office and building designs will also have to change, given what we now know about the risks of transmission in enclosed spaces.We will need to improve ventilation and air filtering inside buildings. Other features like contactless fittings, automatic doors, as well as hand sanitiser and temperature monitoring stations should also become part of the norm.Companies will have to find new and safer ways to deliver their products and services. Many are already embracing digital solutions. Some will need to change their business practices to adapt to the new environment. And I am happy that wet market stallholders and hawkers are now using digital payments more, and online platforms to reach new customers.One major impact is on our construction sector. Construction has been a key vulnerability in this pandemic. The industry will need to institute new safeguards at worksites, and continue its push for automation and productivity, in order to reduce its reliance on migrant workers.Workers in construction – local and foreign – will have to be tested regularly and comprehensively. We will also need to review and improve living arrangements for migrant workers.The present dormitories are in fact the outcome of improvements made over the past decade. But despite this, and the precautions we took, we still had major outbreaks in the dormitories.We will tighten the safeguards and build new dormitories designed to be more resilient against infection risks. But we have to be mindful that the risks will always be there, because of the large number of workers living together and sharing communal facilities. In fact, all communal living spaces, be they dormitories, nursing homes or cruise ships, will always be at risk in the event of an infectious disease outbreak.These are significant changes, which will mean extra costs for the construction industry.For now, the Government is bearing these costs through the Fortitude Budget. Beyond that, we will introduce other measures to cushion the impact, and to move the industry to new productivity levels. Ultimately, re-opening our economy and society does not mean going back to the status quo ante. I know many are looking forward to resume your favourite activities or to get back to your usual routines. But this is not the time for big celebrations or parties. We will all need to adjust our expectations, lifestyles and norms.We have shown our grit, adaptability and resilience during the circuit breaker, and we must continue to demonstrate the same ingenuity and resourcefulness in this new phase.For example, we have found new and creative ways to stay in touch with family and friends – chatting and exercising online, and even having virtual meals or drinks together.We may not be able to travel or have large gatherings anytime soon. But we are going on virtual tours, enjoying online concerts, and learning new skills through online classes. And many of us continue to draw strength from our faiths, thanks to churches, mosques and temples live-streaming their sermons and services to their followers. Every day, we see countless examples of Singaporeans from all walks of life going out of their comfort zones and going the extra mile – they are volunteering at the dormitories, distributing food to the elderly, and looking out for the vulnerable amongst us.Businesses too have been leaning forward to help – they are donating masks and supplies to those in need; and contributing to our frontline COVID-19 operations.This is the Singapore spirit that gives us the confidence to press ahead, no matter how tough the odds.

       " {'text': 'pm lees address on the covid 19 situation in singapore 10 april 2020 My fellow Singaporeans,I spoke to you on TV last week to explain why we needed to implement a circuit breaker. We anticipated a rise in our local COVID-19 cases, especially more unlinked cases that we are unable to trace. We also worried about more cases and clusters emerging in foreign worker dormitories. Unfortunately, in the week since then, these have happened.We have seen outbreaks in several foreign worker dormitories. Many dorms have cases, and some dorms have many cases. We have responded comprehensively to contain the spread in the dorms, and to protect the foreign workers.Yesterday, Ministers Lawrence Wong and Gan Kim Yong explained what we are doing. They have set up an interagency task force to handle the situation in the dorms. Ministry of Health, Ministry of Manpower, the SAF, the Home Team, all are involved. The commander of the task force is the Chief Guards Officer from the Army, and Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean is advising the ministers on this issue.The task force has deployed Forward Assurance and Support Teams in all the dorms. These teams work closely with the dorm operators and can respond quickly to the workers’ essential needs. They are setting up medical facilities and triage clinics, bringing in supplies and food, and managing the logistics and housekeeping. They are making sure the workers have food and water, and WiFi to keep in touch with families back home and friends here, and for entertainment. The SAF and the Home Team have the resources and the organisation to do this. Many other public service agencies are also chipping in. We are paying close attention to the welfare of the foreign workers. They came to Singapore to work hard for a living, and provide for their families back home. They have played an important part building our HDB flats, Changi Airport, MRT lines. We have worked with their employers to make sure they will be paid their salaries, and can remit money home. We will provide them with the medical care and treatment that they need.If any of their family members watch my video, let me say this to them: We appreciate the work and contributions of your sons, fathers, husbands in Singapore. We feel responsible for their well-being. We will do our best to take care of their health, livelihood and welfare here, and to let them go home, safe and sound, to you. On behalf of all Singaporeans, I wish you well. Outside the dorms, the number of cases in the general community has also gone up. Many of these cases are unlinked. We do not know how they got infected, or from whom. So the persons who infected them are probably still out there, and still infecting more people. As I explained last week, we expected this to happen, and to see the numbers go up even after the circuit breaker took effect. The reason is most of these cases were probably infected earlier, before the circuit breaker started.And this is precisely why we need the circuit breaker. If we all reduce our contact with one another, we also reduce our chances of catching or transmitting the virus. This will slow down new infections, both linked and unlinked, and after a while the number of new cases will fall.This has been the experience of countries like China, South Korea, and New Zealand. They all adopted similar tough measures after a surge in infections. But it will take some time. I spoke to Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern of New Zealand yesterday on the phone. New Zealand has implemented a stringent lock down. She told me that when they did this, it was only on Day 11 that they started to see new cases coming down. So we have to be patient, but we also have to be resolute.This is why I need each of you to take the circuit breaker very seriously. Stay at home; stop socialising in person with others, even with extended family members who do not live with you. Keep in touch with them but by other means, for example online, on the phone, writing emails or even letters. But do not make physical contact, because that is how the virus is spread. Please comply not just with the letter of the rules, but their spirit. Some of you have elderly parents who live alone and need your help to go about their daily lives. We understand your concerns. There is some flexibility in the law to accommodate your situation, but if it is at all possible, do not visit between households, not even close kin, not even elderly parents. For example, if you need the grandparents’ help for childcare, then let your kids stay with the grandparents for this period. Do not drop them off and pick them up every day. This is to protect our seniors, and also to protect other people in Singapore.I want to make a special appeal to older Singaporeans. I am one of you, so I know how you feel. When we are cooped up at home, we get restless and frustrated. We want to meet our friends, visit our grandchildren, stretch our legs, and resume our familiar routines – qigong sessions, karaoke groups, hanging out for kopi or a beer with friends. But please understand: We are telling you to stay at home for your own safety. Older people are more vulnerable to the virus. If we catch COVID-19, it is a serious matter. Our chances of dying are much higher, and if we get infected and spread the virus to our friends around our age, or bring the virus back home to our families, then, we put them in grave danger.So please stay home. Use this chance to spend more time with your family, or watch your favourite TV programmes. If you need anything from outside, ask others to get it for you. If you have really no choice but to go out for food or necessities, make sure you wear a mask, and stay a safe distance away from everyone else. Do not linger and do not dawdle – come home once you have completed your errand. Today is Good Friday. For Christians, it is a special time to reflect on the sacrifice of Christ. For Singaporeans, it is a time to acknowledge the sacrifices of our frontline workers, since COVID-19 broke out in Singapore. And for every one of us, it is a time to make our own sacrifices, to observe the circuit breaker strictly, in order to stop the virus from spreading among us.I know the measures are very inconvenient. They also come at high cost to our economy. But the more strictly we observe the restrictions, the faster they will work, and the sooner we can ease up on them. If some of us fail to comply strictly with the measures, the circuit breaker will fail, then all our inconvenience, pain and sacrifice will have been in vain. COVID-19 is very contagious. It only takes a few people to let down their guard, and the virus will slip through. We need everyone to play their part.The next few weeks will be tough. I will speak to you like this from time to time. So that you know what the real situation is, what we are thinking, what you can expect and how you can play your part to fight this virus. The situation will get worse before it gets better, but we have to get through this, before the sun comes out and shines on us again. For us to get there as soon as possible, please stay at home.

       " {'text': 'pm lee hsien loong on the covid 19 situation in singapore We have faced the new coronavirus situation for about two weeks now.The Ministerial Task Force, advised by DPM Heng Swee Keat, has been leading the Government’s response to this outbreak. They have been dealing with new developments every day, and holding regular press briefings to keep Singaporeans informed every step of the way. Today, I want to speak to you directly, to explain where we are, and what may lie ahead. We went through SARS 17 years ago, so we are much better prepared to deal with nCoV this time. Practically, we have stockpiled adequate supplies of masks and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). We have expanded and upgraded our medical facilities, including the new National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID). We have more advanced research capabilities to study the virus. We have more well trained doctors and nurses to deal with this situation. We are psychologically better prepared too. Singaporeans know what to expect, and how to react. Most importantly, having overcome SARS once, we know that we can pull through this too.The new coronavirus is similar to SARS, but with two important differences. First, the new virus is more infectious than SARS. Therefore it is harder to stop it from spreading. Second, the new virus is much less dangerous than SARS. About 10 per cent of those who caught SARS died. With the new virus, outside of Hubei province, the mortality rate is so far only 0.2 per cent. In comparison, seasonal influenza has a death rate of 0.1 per cent. So in terms of mortality, the new virus is much closer to influenza than SARS.But the situation is still evolving. Every day brings new developments, and we have to respond promptly and dynamically. So far, most of our cases have either been imported from China, or can be traced to imported cases. When we discover them, we have isolated the patients, done contact tracing and quarantined close contacts. This has contained the spread and helped stamp out several local clusters. But in the last few days, we have seen some cases which cannot be traced to the source of infection. These worried us, because it showed that the virus is probably already circulating in our own population. This is why we raised the DORSCON to Orange yesterday, and are stepping up measures. We are reducing mingling in schools. We are tightening up access to our hospitals. We are taking extra precautions at large public events. I have already postponed my Chinese New Year Istana Garden Party for grassroots leaders, which was to be held tomorrow. We have raised DORSCON to Orange before. You may not remember, but this was in 2009, for the H1N1 swine flu. So there is no need to panic. We are not locking down the city or confining everybody to stay at home. We have ample supplies, so there is no need to stock up with instant noodles, tinned food, or toilet paper, as some people did yesterday. Whatever the situation, we can each do our part. One, observe personal hygiene – wash your hands often, and avoid touching your eyes or face unnecessarily. Two, take your temperature twice daily. And three, if you are not well, please avoid crowded places and see a doctor immediately. These simple steps do not take much effort, but if we all do them, they will go a long way towards containing the spread of the virus.Right now, we are continuing to do contact tracing and to quarantine close contacts. But I expect to see more cases with no known contacts in the coming days.If the numbers keep growing, at some point we will have to reconsider our strategy. If the virus is widespread, it is futile to try to trace every contact. If we still hospitalise and isolate every suspect case, our hospitals will be overwhelmed. At that point, provided that the fatality rate stays low like flu, we should shift our approach. Encourage those who only have mild symptoms to see their family GP, and rest at home instead of going to the hospital, and let hospitals and healthcare workers focus on the most vulnerable patients – the elderly, young children, and those with medical complications.We are not at that point yet. It may or may not happen, but we are thinking ahead and anticipating the next few steps. And I am sharing these possibilities with you, so that we are all mentally prepared for what may come.I am confident of the medical outcome of this outbreak. Most Singaporeans should remain well, and of those who get ill most should expect to recover. Among those who have been hospitalised so far, most are stable or improving. Several have already recovered and been discharged, although a few remain in critical condition. But the real test is to our social cohesion and psychological resilience. Fear and anxiety are natural human reactions. We all want to protect ourselves and our families from what is still a new and unknown disease. But fear can do more harm than the virus itself. It can make us panic, or do things which make matters worse, like circulating rumours online, hoarding facemasks or food, or blaming particular groups for the outbreak. We should take courage and see through this stressful time together.That is in fact what many Singaporeans are doing. Grassroots leaders and Team Nila volunteers have stepped forward to help distribute masks to households. University students are delivering food daily to schoolmates confined to their dorms on leave of absence. Healthcare workers are on the front line, treating patients in hospitals and clinics and helping them get well again. Business federations, unions, public transport workers, are going the extra mile to maintain services, take care of workers, and keep Singapore running. They are inspirations to all of us. This is what it means to be Singaporean. This is who we are.Let us stay united and resolute in this new coronavirus outbreak.

       " {'text': 'everything you need to know about quarantine orders Various precautionary measures have been implemented to protect Singaporeans and contain the spread of COVID-19. One of these is the Quarantine Order (QO) – which differs from the Stay-Home Notice (SHN). More on the SHN here. A QO is issued to quarantine an individual who is, or is suspected to be, a carrier of an infectious disease, or a contact of a person confirmed to have an infectious disease. This is with the aim of limiting the spread of the virus in the community. A QO is a legal order issued to individuals under the Infectious Diseases Act. It has legal force with severe penalties for non-compliance.QOs are issued to: Singapore Residents and Long-term Pass Holders returning from Hubei Province Close contacts of confirmed COVID-19 casesQuarantine usually occurs in the home but can also be served in dedicated Government Quarantine Facilities (GQFs) or hospitals, should the individual not have suitable accommodation in Singapore.What must I do when I am being quarantined? How will it affect my household members?Those under quarantine are not supposed to come into contact with others in order to avoid the possibility of the spread of virus through person-to-person contact. Hence, those under quarantine will need to be separated from and cannot physically interact with others living in the same premises.You should also monitor your temperature and report your health status at least 3 times a day, and inform your QO Agent if you feel unwell or need any assistance.Should your household members display symptoms associated with the virus, they will need to be taken to a hospital and treated as suspect cases.How will those who are under quarantine orders at home be monitored?Individuals under quarantine will be monitored by video calls at least three times a day.Spot checks will be carried out to ensure that they strictly adhere to the conditions under the QO during the period specified. If they are found to be non-compliant, the Director of Medical Services may require them to wear an electronic tag or order that they be detained and separated in a hospital or in any other suitable place. It is an offence if they do not comply with the conditions listed in accordance with the QO.If I need to go out to attend to urgent matters, what should I do?What will happen if I break quarantine?Persons under quarantine must not leave their designated location for any reason. Should they require assistance for daily needs beyond what is provided for under the home quarantine package, they should arrange with their relatives/ friends to purchase groceries and assist in their daily needs whenever necessary. If they urgently need to leave their place of quarantine / their home for matters needing personal attention which cannot be postponed, they must first seek the permission of the QO Agent.Spot checks will be carried out to ensure that they strictly adhere to the conditions under the Quarantine Order during the period specified. If they are found to be non-compliant, the Director of Medical Services may require them to wear an electronic tag or order that they be detained and separated in a hospital or in any other suitable place. It is an offence if they do not comply with the conditions listed in accordance with the QO.I have been in recent contact with someone who has been issued a QO. What should I do?Persons issued with a Quarantine Order are individuals assessed to have had close contact with a confirmed case, and they are generally well and have no symptoms.We would advise you to monitor your health closely. If you have fever, cough or runny nose, wear a mask and seek medical attention promptly. Call the clinic ahead of your visit and inform the doctor of your symptoms as well as your travel history, if any.I heard that people who are served a QO will receive $100 a day under the Quarantine Order Allowance (QOA). Is that true?The Quarantine Order Allowance is set up to mitigate financial impact for those who have been served Quarantine Orders. When they have completed their quarantine order, claims of $100 per day can be made by self-employed Singapore Citizens or Permanent Residents, and by Singapore-registered companies whose employees under QO are Singaporean Citizens, Permanent Residents or Workpass Holders.Please refer to thisfactsheetfor more information. You can also approach your QO agent for further queries.I am an employer. How do I know if my employees have been issued a Quarantine Order (QO)? How do I apply for the Quarantine Order Allowance (QOA)?A Quarantine Order (QO) agent will get in touch with your employee if he/she has been issued a QO. Your employee should notify you that he/she has been issued a QO.You can only apply for the Quarantine Order Allowance (QOA) after your employee has completed the quarantine/ The person under quarantine will receive the QOA form at the end of the quarantine and pass it to the employer. This is to ensure that he/she has fully compiled with the QO, under the Infectious Disease Act. The employer can then submit the form to MOH for processing.Please refer to thisfactsheetfor more information.I am employed. Does being under a QO utilise my quota for medical leave or hospitalisation leave?Employees who are served a QO will be deemed to be on paid sick leave. The period of absence from work would be treated as paid hospitalisation leave, as part of the employees’ hospitalisation leave eligibility under their employment contracts or agreements.Please refer to thisadvisoryby the Ministry of Manpower (MOM).If I am unemployed, but under a Quarantine Order (QO), who can I go to for social and financial assistance?If you are unemployed, but under a Quarantine Order (QO), and need social or financial assistance, please contact your QO agent for further assistance.', 'id': 'ca9a00a6-f3ff-46d5-b10a-701a9d70e737', 'score': None, 'probability': None, 'question': None, 'meta': {'category': 'articles'}, 'embedding': None},\n",
       " {'text': \"how a breakthrough lab test expert contact tracing solved mystery behind largest covid 19 cluster A staff meeting at a church in Tanglin. A Sunday service at another church in Paya Lebar more than a week earlier. A Chinese New Year gathering at Mei Hwan Drive in Serangoon.Three seemingly unrelated events that bore no apparent link to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases here, much less to each other.But with expert contact tracing by the Ministry of Health (MOH) and the Singapore Police Force (SPF), coupled with a world’s first laboratory test, the mystery link between one of the largest COVID-19 cluster here and travellers from Wuhan was finally found.Case 66 – the primary case at Grace Assembly of GodCase 66, a 28 year-old Singaporean male with no travel history to China, works at the Grace Assembly of God as a church staff.He had reported the onset of symptoms on 29 January– the earliest in the cluster– and had gone to work at the church's Tanglin branch while symptomatic.Sixteen members and staff of the church were subsequently infected with the virus – initially through a staff meeting he attended, and subsequently through various church activities.Through detailed epidemiological investigation and assistance from the SPF, MOH determined that Case 66 was the primary case of the cluster at Grace Assembly of God.But how did Case 66 first contract the virus?CNY gathering at Mei Hwan DriveOn 12 February, Case 66 was referred to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID). He was confirmed to have COVID-19 infection two days later.Upon further investigation, MOH found that he had attended a Chinese New Year (CNY) gathering at Mei Hwan Drive on the first day of CNY, 25 January.Among the attendees were Cases 83 and 91, a married couple.When contacted by the contact tracing team, both Cases 83 and 91 were, however, not sick; they had no symptoms of COVID-19.Cases 83 and 91 – the missing linkChecking through their records, MOH found that Case 91 had actually gone to Sengkang General Hospital’s emergency department on 26 January with COVID-19-like symptoms. Based on the case definitions at that time, she was not identified as a suspect case.Her husband, Case 83, had also been unwell in end-January, and had sought treatment several times at a general practitioner clinic.MOH’s investigations had also earlier uncovered that both Cases 83 and 91 were at The Life Church and Missions Singapore on 19 January – the same day Cases 8 and 9, two Chinese nationals from Wuhan, had visited the church.MOH were now presented with a possible link between Wuhan (Cases 8 and 9), The Life Church and Missions Singapore cluster (through Cases 83 and 91), and the Grace Assembly of God cluster (through Case 66).Cases 83 and 91 likely got infected from Cases 8 and 9, and had then passed the infection to Case 66 at the CNY gathering, who subsequently passed to his colleagues at Grace Assembly of God.Establishing a positive link despite COVID-19 negativeMOH arranged for Cases 83 and 91 to be tested at NCID. However, as both were already well, the current test to confirm COVID-19 infection would not work.This is because the lab test, called Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), detects whether viral genetic material (COVID-19 in this case) is present in a patient’s biological sample. When a patient has recovered and his immune system cleared of the virus, the test would return negative.However, knowing that the immune system produces antibodies in response to the infection – which can stay with the recovered patient for several years – MOH decided to test them with a new type of test, known as the serological test.Serological testing – a world’s firstIn came the research team at Duke-NUS Medical School, who had earlier successfully cultured the COVID-19 virus shortly after Singapore confirmed its first case. The team had then rapidly developed several laboratory tests to detect the virus-specific antibodies for contact tracing, among other applications.Using two different antibody testing platforms (virus neutralisation assay and ELISA assay), they were able to confirm that Cases 83 and 91 had high levels of antibodies that were specific to COVID-19.This meant that both cases had indeed been infected with COVID-19 in late-January, even though they had since recovered.This was a significant piece of evidence, as it definitively established the links between the two church clusters, the CNY family gathering, and the travellers from Wuhan.Close collaboration between agenciesThis significant breakthrough was made possible through the close collaboration between MOH’s contact tracing and epidemiological teams, SPF, as well as the researchers at Duke-NUS Medical School.MOH and SPF had extensively analysed the activity maps of the confirmed cases, interviewed them as well as their close contacts, in order to establish a detailed map of possible transmission across the different cases.Duke-NUS researchers’ quick response then provided the confirmation needed to connect the clusters together.With the discovery of the links between the two church clusters to the travellers from Wuhan, MOH has now determined the likely source of infection for a large majority of the locally-transmitted cases.\", 'id': '93039978-755e-4929-9697-d5c0b8470dcc', 'score': None, 'probability': None, 'question': None, 'meta': {'category': 'articles'}, 'embedding': None},\n",
       " {'text': 'coping with covid 19 economic measures The 2019-Coronavirus, or COVID-19 has impacted the global economy – as well as our local economy – in a big way.Sectors such as tourism and transport havebeen directly affected. And since China is an indispensable part of the global economy, other sectors, such as manufacturing, retail and F&B can expect to be impacted too.Here are six ways that the Government is helping companies and workers stay afloat.1. A Stabilisation and Support package for workers and enterprisesThe Government will support Singapore firms and workers in the coming months, with a $4 billion package.A Jobs Support Scheme will help enterprises retain local workers, while an enhanced Wage Credit Scheme will support wage increases for Singaporean workers.To help firms with cash flow, a Corporate Income Tax rebate was announced for 2020, and several tax treatments under the corporate tax system will be enhanced for a year. There will also be help for enterprises to access working capital more easily with the enhanced Enterprise Financing Scheme’s Working Capital Loan component.To support tenants and lessees of Government managed properties, options for more flexible rental payments will be introduced.Besides these measures, firms are also encouraged to diversify.Diversification should apply to(i) Supply chains; as China is involved in many high-tech manufacturing activities(ii) The country’s foreign workforce2. Support for the tourism sectorThe Singapore Tourism Board earlier announcedthat the licence fees for hotels, travel agents and tour guides will be waived as part of measures to help the tourism sector.The STB had earlier estimated that international visitor arrivals may fall by 20 to 30 per cent this year.This is due to a decline of travellers coming through Changi Airport, as well as an increase in hotel room cancellations. A number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 were travellers from Wuhan, and had put up in Singapore hotels.STB will defray the cleaning and disinfecting cost of these hotels that provided accomodation to the confirmed and suspected cases.Up to 50 per cent of third-party professional cleaning fees will be covered, with a cap of $20,000 per hotel with confirmed cases, and a cap of $10,000 per hotel with suspected cases.At Budget 2020,DPM Heng announced property tax rebates for the year 2020, for the accommodation and function room components of licensed hotels and serviced apartments, and prescribed MICE venues. Rebates will also apply to ferry terminals and Integrated Resorts.A Temporary Bridging Loan Programme will be introduced to provide more cash flow for enterprises in the tourism sector.3. Support for the aviation sectorRebates on aircraft landing and parking charges, assistance to ground handling agents, and rental rebates for shops and cargo agents at Changi Airport were announced at Budget 2020.There will also be a 15 per cent Property Tax Rebatefor Changi Airport.4. Helping taxis and Private Hire Car driversA $77-milion package willhelp taxi and Private Hire Car drivers through this uncertain period.It’s a co-funded package – with the Government funding $45 million, and taxi and private-hire companies paying for the rest.All main taxi hirers will receive $20 in their hiring account each day. Active Private Hire Car drivers will also be eligible for this package. This benefits some 40,000 drivers in Singapore.5. Support for F&B establishmentsThe National Environment Agency will be providing a full month of rental waiver to stallholders in NEA-managed hawker centres and markets.Other Government agencies, like HDB, will provide half a month of rental waiver to its commercial tenants.6. Help for employers affected by Leave of Absence and Stay-Home NoticesSingapore residents and Long-term pass holders returning from Mainland China (outside of Hubei) are issueda Stay-Home Notice of 14 days.The Government acknowledges that such a requirement can cause inconvenience to Singapore companies.As such, eligible employers will be able to apply for the Leave of Absence Support Programme.It gives the employer $100 daily per affected worker for the duration of the LOA. From 18 Feb 2359hr, this will be extended to those affected by the Stay-Home Notice requirement.Eligible self-employed persons can also apply for the $100 daily.', 'id': 'd42456f2-b2fb-468c-877b-ba7c7de9f46e', 'score': None, 'probability': None, 'question': None, 'meta': {'category': 'articles'}, 'embedding': None},\n",

       " {'text': 'pm lee hsien loong on the covid 19 situation in singapore 3 apr My fellow SingaporeansGood afternoonUpdate on current situationI last spoke to you on COVID-19 three weeks ago.Since then, the number of new cases daily has begun to rise. We used to see fewer than 10 new cases a day. But in the last two weeks, despite our best efforts, we have routinely had more than 50 new cases daily.Initially, many of the new cases were imported from overseas, mostly returning Singaporeans. Then last week, we began to have more local cases. Furthermore, despite our good contact tracing, for nearly half of these cases, we do not know where or from whom the person caught the virus. This suggests that there are more people out there who are infected, but who have not been identified. And they may be passing the virus unknowingly to others.In the last few days, we have also discovered several clusters at foreign worker dormitories, and one at a nursing home. These are very worrying, because large numbers of people live together in dormitories and nursing homes. A single case can quickly lead to a large cluster. Furthermore, nursing home patients are mostly old and frail, and very vulnerable to the virus.Applying a circuit breakerAs the situation developed over the past weeks, we have tightened our safe-distancing measures progressively. Singaporeans have responded well, calmly and responsibly, and made adjustments in their daily lives. By working together, we have kept the outbreak under control. But looking at the trend, I am worried that unless we take further steps, things will gradually get worse, or another big cluster may push things over the edge. I discussed this with the Multi-Ministry Task Force (MTF). We have decided that instead of tightening incrementally over the next few weeks, we should make a decisive move now, to pre-empt escalating infections. We will therefore impose significantly stricter measures. This is like a circuit breaker.It will help reduce the risk of a big outbreak occurring. And it should also help to gradually bring our numbers down. This in turn will then allow us to relax some of the measures. This circuit breaker will apply for one month, in the first instance. The Task Force is holding a Press Conference immediately after I finish speaking to you, to explain the details. But let me give you the key points.First, we will close most workplaces, except for essential services and key economic sectors. Food establishments, markets and supermarkets, clinics, hospitals, utilities, transport and key banking services will remain open. They are essential services. We also should not disrupt economic sectors that are strategic, or form part of a global supply chain. People working in these industries can continue to go to work, with safe-distancing measures in place. But most other work premises must close. If the person can work from home, he should do so. But others will not be able to, including foreign workers on construction sites and in shipyards. These workers live in dormitories, and we will make arrangements to look after them. The closure of work places will take effect from next Tuesday. This will ensure that most of our workforce stays at home and limits their physical interaction to as few people as possible.Second, we will also move to full home-based learning in our schools and Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs). We started with one day of home-based learning this week. This has gone smoothly, with teething issues being resolved. Ministry of Education (MOE) will work with the schools to implement full home-based learning starting next Wednesday. All preschool and student care centres will also be closed, but will provide limited services for children of parents who have to continue working and are unable to make alternative care arrangements.Third, we will tighten restrictions on movements and gatherings of people. It boils down to three things. First, stay at home, as much as possible. Second, avoid socialising with others beyond your own household. Gatherings should be confined to your household. Avoid visiting even your extended families who are not staying with you, especially if they are elderly or vulnerable. Third, go out only to do essential things. For work, if you are in essential services or key economic sectors. To buy food at markets, or to take out from restaurants and hawker centres. Or to exercise in the neighbourhood park, keeping a safe distance from others. The spirit of these measures is to get all of us to minimise physical contact. If we do not go out, if we avoid contact with others, then the virus will not be able to spread. It is as simple as that.I know this is very hard to do. Very hard to do as a practical matter, in places like hawker centres and wet markets, it is difficult to practise safe-distancing, especially on the weekends when it is crowded. It will help if we all adjust our habits. For example, do our marketing on weekdays instead of weekends to avoid the crowd. We will also deploy more Safe-Distancing Ambassadors to encourage people not to crowd together, so please cooperate with themSafe distancing is also hard for a psychological and emotional reason: it goes very much against our human instincts. It is in our nature to want to socialise, to be close to those we are talking to, to take comfort in the warmth and company of friends and family. I fully understand this. But I hope you will also understand why we all have to take social distancing extremely seriously in this period. This is the only effective way to slow the transmission of the virus, so that we gradually bring our numbers down. It is also the best way to keep our families safe, and particularly to protect our seniors from getting ill. So please bear with the painful adjustments that we have make. Each and every one of us can, and must do our part, to keep everyone in Singapore safe from COVID-19.I decided to speak to you directly today to explain why we need to make this major move now. But also to reassure you that things will be alright. Essential services will continue running so that all of us can cope with this new situation, as we batten down to fight this virus. We have enough food supplies to last us through this period and beyond. You can still shop at the supermarket or wet market. And you need not rush to stock up for weeks at a time. You can still buy food from your favourite hawker centres or coffee shop. Though you will have to take out and eat at home with your own family. Rather than hang out and eat outside with your friends.I know these measures will impact our workers and businesses severely. This is already a very difficult time for them. We will help them come through this. On Monday in Parliament, DPM Heng Swee Keat will announce additional support for households and businesses, over and above what was provided in the two earlier Budgets. We will also legislate to require landlords to pass on property tax rebates fully to their tenants. We will also pass new temporary legislation to let businesses and individuals defer certain contractual obligations for a period, such as paying rent, repaying loans, or completing work.Face MasksBesides implementing this circuit breaker, we also are rethinking our advice on face masks.Up to now, the Government has advised the general public that you only need to wear a mask if you are not feeling well, and this is to protect others from your germs. This was based on scientific advice and guidelines from the World Health Organization (WHO). We also did not have community spread in Singapore then, so it was very unlikely for you to run into anyone with COVID-19 on the street, much less be infected by them. Nevertheless, the Government gave each household four surgical masks, to use in case you got sick, and to give people peace of mind.Now, the situation is changing. We now think there are some cases out there in the community going undetected, though probably still not that many. We also now have evidence that an infected person can show no symptoms, and yet still pass on the virus to others. This is why the World Health Organization is reviewing the issue of face masks, and so is the US Communicable Disease Centre (CDC).Therefore, we will no longer discourage people from wearing masks . Wearing a mask may help to protect others, in case you have the virus but don’t know it. This is so that you keep your droplets to yourself - when you sneeze or speak or cough. It can also protect yourself a little better, especially if you are elderly, or vulnerable because of pre-existing health conditions.We still want to conserve surgical masks for the people who really need them – healthcare workers in clinics and hospitals. For everyone else, in a community setting, alternatives like reusable masks will give some added protection. So from this Sunday, the Government will distribute reusable masks to all households. Meanwhile, many community groups have been making and distributing reusable masks for the elderly and vulnerable. I applaud these efforts. They show our community spirit and mutual care.But remember, mask or no mask, you still need to wash your hands, and keep a safe distance away from other people.ConclusionThe next few weeks will be pivotal. Even after these stepped-up measures, the number of cases will quite likely still go up in the next few days. They can be cases who have already been infected earlier. Except they have not yet shown symptoms, or not yet gone to see their doctor. But if we keep our efforts up, within a few weeks we should be able to bring the numbers under control, bring the numbers down, and get into a more sustainable position. We will keep on doing our utmost to protect every Singaporean from COVID-19. Many people have been working tirelessly for the past two months. Our nurses and doctors, our contact tracers and healthcare staff. We thank them all for their efforts and sacrifices. Now we are all enlisted to join them on the frontline.It will be a long fight. But if any country can see this through, it is Singapore. We have the resources. We have the determination. We are united. By helping one another through this, we will prevail, and emerge stronger.Thank you.', 'id': 'c86a0863-9def-49e8-8afc-c00ed79137be', 'score': None, 'probability': None, 'question': None, 'meta': {'category': 'articles'}, 'embedding': None},\n",
       " {'text': 'local doctors publish open letter calling for halt to covid 19 jabs for 200000 boys Read 3 articles daily and stand to win ST rewards, including the ST News Tablet worth $398. Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - Some doctors and cardiologists here have written an open letter appealing to the Expert Committee on Covid-19 Vaccinationto halt the vaccination exercise for some 200,000 schoolboys, following the death of a 13-year-old in the United States after he received the vaccination. The US media last Thursday (June 24) reported that the boy, from Saginaw county in Michigan, died three days after getting his second dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, supposedly from heart failure. It is unclear which vaccine he received. The Saginaw County Health Department said the US Centres For Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was investigating if there was a link between the vaccination and the boy\\'s death. The open letter, which was published on Facebook last Saturday by a cardiologist, Dr Kho Kwang Po, was addressed to Professor Benjamin Ong, chairman of the expert committee. It callsfor a short delay in Singapore\\'s vaccination exercise until the CDC and organisations elsewhere have produced more robust and convincing data on the case. \"This is very important as our mRNA (vaccination) programme for boys is massive... one of the most aggressive programmes in the world,\"Dr Kho wrote in his Facebook post. This comes amid parental concerns and worries about mRNA vaccines, includingthe Pfizer and Moderna ones, after data on myocarditis among healthy young males was published here, he noted. As at June 11, four of the six cases of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart) among people vaccinated here involved men between 18 and 30 years old. All four reported symptoms of heart inflammation within a few days of receiving their second dose of the vaccines, and have since recovered. The letter said: \"Could we take a more sensible and prudent posture? Can we give the CDC (and other organisations) more time to investigate and provide us with high-quality data on the possibly fatal effects of mRNA vaccines in youths?\" The letter was signed by Dr Kho, Dr Wong Wui Min, a cardiologist and heart specialist at W.M. Wong Cardiac and Medical Clinic in Gleneagles Hospital, Dr A.M. Chia, Dr L.W. Ping, and Dr I.W. Yang, \"on behalf of many concerned paediatricians, primary care physicians, specialists, surgeons and GPs\". The Straits Times has contacted Dr Kho for comment. The Ministry of Health, when asked if it would consider the suggestions in the letter, said only that there was no change in the vaccination plans. Covid-19 vaccination in Singapore is currently voluntary, though the Government has strongly urged people to get vaccinated if they are eligible. The expert committee previously said that while further studies and investigations are ongoing, the currently available data suggests that there may be a very small risk of myocarditis and pericarditis after the second dose of an mRNA vaccine. Most cases are mild,and the patients recover without the need for significant intervention and do not suffer any long-term effects, it noted. Severe cases may result in damage to the heart muscles, although that is very rare, it added. The assessment was that the benefits of mRNA vaccines - reduction in Covid-19 infections and less severe complications even if infected - continue to outweigh the risks. Three independent bodies of local medical experts - the Chapter of Cardiologists at the College of Physicians, the Academy of Medicine and the Singapore Cardiac Society - had also reiterated on June 14 that the risk of heart conditions associated with Covid-19 mRNA vaccines is “very small”. The US Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System has confirmed 393 cases of myocarditis or pericarditis, out of more than 318 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines administered in the US as at last Monday. Most of the cases were in male adolescents and young adults. While some have required hospitalisation, most have recovered from the symptoms, said the CDC. Meanwhile, another online petition calling for the suspension of vaccinations in Singapore for those under 30, particularly children between the ages of 12 and 15, has also surfaced. The petition, supposedly started by a number of concerned parents, hadreceived more than 1,200 signatures as atSunday afternoon. Addressed to Health Minister Ong Ye Kung and the multi-ministry task force tackling Covid-19, the petition also referencesthe death of the 13-year-old in the US, and asksfor the vaccinations to be temporarily suspended until more data from the US is made available. It notesthat most of the young people have already received the first dose - which is able to give around 75 per cent protection against Covid-19. As at last Thursday, some 83 per cent of students aged 12 and above had received one jab or booked their vaccination appointments. The figure was 39 per cent for those aged 12 to 39. \"Wouldn\\'t that be enough protection while we await the results of the investigation before we proceed with the second dose?\" the petition asks. A housewifewho signed the petition told ST that she has been worried about getting her two children vaccinated after reading about the links between the vaccines and myocarditis. The woman, who wanted to be known only as Ms Loh, noted that the US Food and Drug Administration had revised the fact sheets included with the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to say there is a rare risk of heart inflammation. “My older son, 21, is a special needs person with multiple allergies, and he isn’t able to speak. His doctor certified in early April that he is unsuitable for mRNA vaccinesand said he should wait for the next available one,” she said, noting that rules were relaxed for some people with allergies. MOH relaxed its vaccination guidelines in March, allowing people with multiple allergiesand cancer patients who are not in treatment to get vaccinated, as long as they do not have a history of anaphylaxis. “I’m hoping that the Novavax vaccine can be made available by the end of the year so that my son can be vaccinated with it,” said Ms Loh, 51. The Novavax vaccine is protein-basedand uses a laboratory-made version of the Sars-CoV-2 spike protein to stimulate an immune response. Ms Loh said she intends to let her daughter take one jab first when she turns 12 in November, since the child does not have any known allergies. In the meantime, Ms Loh is hoping to learn more about the CDC investigation relating to the death ofthe 13-year-old boy in the US. She said: “I agree that vaccination to achieve herd immunity is the only way to end this pandemic, but I think we as parents need more guidance on what will happen if children get side effects such as Bell’s palsyor heart inflammation. Where should they go to get treatment and will the Ministry of Healthbe following up on their cases?” Some parents, however, still feel confident about allowing their children to take the vaccines. Ms Mary Ann Silverio, 42, an IT consultant, told ST that she and her son, a Secondary 3 student, are not worried about him taking his second jab of the Pfizer vaccine in a few weeks. “All the side effects are usually explained beforehand, and the cases of myocarditis have been rare, so I trust that the vaccine should be quite safe,” she said.

       " {'text': 'post circuit breaker when can we move on to phases 2 and 3 Updated 28 May 2020As announced by the Multi-Ministry Taskforce on 19 May 2020, Singapore will embark on a three-phased approach to resume activities safely, post-circuit breaker.Phase One of this approach involves the safe re-opening of economic activities that do not pose high risk of transmission.It includes the resumption of selected services, like motor vehicle and aircon servicing, all hairdressing services, selected health services. Schools will start to reopen.For more details on Phase One (Safe Re-Opening), click here.A critical pre-condition for us to be able to move into the next phase or ease certain measures further within each phase, is to have improved capabilities to control and contain any subsequent outbreaks.Hence Singapore will continue building our capabilities in the following areas: Expanding our testing capacity to be able to diagnose cases early, screen all individuals at risk, and protect the more vulnerable groups Speed up contact tracing to identify and isolate close contacts of infected persons Ensure sufficient healthcare capacity to deal with any potential surges in cases that we must still expect from time to time If community transmission rates remain low, Singapore can then move to Phases Two and Three in subsequent weeks. Phase Two (Safe Transition)The Government will carefully monitor the effects of increased activity in Phase One, and if the community infection rates remain low and stable over the subsequent two weeks, Phase Two could happen before the end of June.In Phase Two, almost the entire economy will re-open, subject to safe management measures being in place. More activities will resume. Retail, F&B, and other services Most businesses will be allowed to resume, with safe management measures, group size and capacity limits in place. These include retail, F&B dine-in, personal health and wellness, as well as home-based services. Sports and other public facilities, e.g. stadiums, swimming pools, will be opened too. Social interactions and family visits Masks will remain compulsory whenever outside one’s home. Small-group gatherings of up to 5 persons will be allowed. Within one’s home, households may receive up to 5 visitors per day. As seniors are especially vulnerable, they should exercise caution and stay at home as much as possible. To support them and their caregivers, more senior services and programmes, such as senior care centres, will resume with appropriate safe management measures in place. Schools Schools will fully re-open from end June, while Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) will gradually increase the number of students back on campus at any one time for face-to-face learning.For higher-risk activities, the Government will be engaging businesses and organisations on how and when they may resume safely, with the necessary safe management measures and safeguards. Such activities include: Religious services and congregations Cultural venues such as art galleries, libraries and museums Large-scale events and venues, such as conferences, exhibitions, concerts and trade fairs Entertainment venues such as bars, nightclubs, karaoke outlets, cinemas, theatres, and other indoor and outdoor attractionsDepending on the COVID-19 situation and the Government’s risk assessment, the measures (e.g. size of gatherings) will continue to be eased gradually until we reach a new normal in Phase Three.Phase Three (Safe Nation)This will be the ‘new normal’ for Singapore, as we expect to remain at this state until an effective vaccine or treatment for COVID-19 is developed.What’s expected to be allowed: Social, cultural, religious and business gatherings or events would have resumed Gathering sizes would have to be limited in order to prevent large clusters from arising. Seniors would be able to resume day-to-day activities Safe distancing measures need to be practised, peak period travel, crowded places and large groups need to be avoided. Public commutesAs more of us return to work and school, more will be taking public transport. Businesses should stagger working hours to minimise travel during peak periods. Commuters will have to wear a mask, refrain from talking to one another or on their mobile phones, and maintain good personal hygiene. Cleaning of buses and trains will be stepped up.Opening of bordersSingapore will gradually re-open our borders for Singaporeans to conduct essential activities overseas and to allow safe travel for foreigners entering or transiting through Singapore. Necessary precautions and safeguards will be in place. As the global situation remains volatile, such moves will be assessed and implemented separately from the timing of the three phases of re-opening outlined above.For more on what we can do to resume activities safely, click here.', 'id': 'd6d907c4-0a31-43c7-875b-a4893eee4ab3', 'score': None, 'probability': None, 'question': None, 'meta': {'category': 'articles'}, 'embedding': None},\n",
       " {'text': 'the beng who gives out free packets of food Some hawker stalls in the CBD area may have closed their shutters temporarily, after seeing their businesses take a hit due to the COVID-19 pandemic. But not for young hawkers Jason Chua, 28, and Hung Zhen Long, 27, who run a rice bowl stall called “Beng Who Cooks” at Hong Lim Food Centre.The pair even started an initiative to serve food to anyone who is unable to afford meals – no questions asked. An Instagram post, on the @bengwhocaresfoundation page set up for this initiative, calls for people to DM them to place meal orders if they were ‘’unable to put food on the table’’.Indeed, during this outbreak, jobs have been affected and some are facing financial difficulties. *For information on relief packages and schemes available, click here.During the circuit breaker period, Jason recalls juggling both cooking meals, and replying to more than 500 texts a day. He received many donation enquiries too – not before announcing to his Instagram followers that the best way for them to help was simply to spread the word and order meals for those in need. Pressing on despite difficulties Not all was smooth-sailing – Jason and Zhen Long have been scolded by customers, and some have even taken advantage of their generosity. Jason recounts an instance where he realised one of their regular beneficiaries who had been getting free meals for two weeks was not who he said he was, after he bumped into him at a private gym nearby. These moments can be demoralising, but he says he tries to take these instances as a lesson learnt as they’re still new to this. He confesses that the finances are a challenge – the money he spent during the two months in Circuit Breaker comes close to their earnings in one and a half years. But still, the drive to continue remains. “At the end of the day, I just want to make my family proud”The motivation for this initiative runs deep from Jason’s own personal experiences. He recalls to a time when he was young and his dad was out of a job due to the financial crisis that hit Singapore. He recounts being oblivious to the situation as his parents did not tell him what happened then. “My dad was hit pretty badly, but he didn’t tell us. I was still eating fast food everyday. It was only when I was in secondary school that my mum told me how my dad was starving so much at that time.These are the life lessons that help Jason press on. During the Circuit Breaker period, Jason says he has spent more time with his parents. Through this, he has also realised that his parents have advanced in their years, and he feels the desire to make them proud. It further motivates him to carry on with this initiative. Despite the busy-ness, he says his wife is still supportive. One of his most memorable moments was his wife telling him “you’re always so busy, you don’t even have time for me.... but, I’m proud of you, I love you”.Inspiring those in needThere are moments that make it all worthwhile. A homeless man who had been taking free meals from them for over two weeks eventually told them that he didn’t need free meals anymore.Jason recalls, “He just came up to us and said, ‘I don’t need (the free meal) any more. I found a job. You guys motivated me. Seeing you work inspired me to get back on my feet.” Another beneficiary is a blind 80 year-old man, whom Jason says he’ll continue to give free meals to, even if the list of beneficiaries whittles down over time.As for his future plans, Jason says he will keep going for now – at least for the 10 to 15 customers who really need it. He’ll continue to give these regular beneficaries free food everyday. He admits that this whole journey has been a struggle at times, and his advice to fellow Singaporeans during these difficult times is to persevere and not give up.

Expansion of community testing MOH will expand its testing strategy to test more extensively among key population groups in the community: Close contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the community, at the start and end of their quarantine period Vulnerable or higher-risk groups in community, this includes the recent testing of staff and residents of MOH and Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) residential homes serving the elderly, and all preschool staff Incoming travellers before the end of their Stay-Home Notice periodAll individuals aged 13 and above who are diagnosed with acute respiratory infection (ARI) at first presentation to a doctor will now be tested for COVID-19 from 1 July onwards. This is an expansion from the current testing of all individuals aged 45 and above who are diagnosed with ARI. As clinical and scientific evidence shows that an infected person is most infectious right before and immediately after the start of symptoms, this expanded testing strategy allows MOH to detect infected individuals early and to quickly contain further spread.Singapore will also conduct more active and targeted surveillance testing in the community where needed eg. testing target groups such as frontline staff interacting with travellers as we open our borders.Supporting Public Health Preparedness Clinics In the last few months, more than 900 Public Health Preparedness Clinics (PHPCs) provided subsidised consultation and treatment for Singaporeans, Permanent Residents and eligible Work Permit holders diagnosed with respiratory infections. More than 450,000 patients have benefitted from subsidies for treatment of respiratory infections at PHPCs and polyclinics, with around $31 million in subsidies disbursed to date.MOH will provide a one-off $10,000 COVID-19 grant to each PHPC in recognition of the role PHPCs play in combatting COVID-19. MOH will also provide a one-time start-up grant of $1,200 in recognition of the costs and efforts PHPCs incurred in supporting the national COVID-19 testing effort and to encourage more PHPCs to join the Swab and Send Home Programme. In addition, an Assurance Grant will also be provided to support PHPCs whose doctors contract COVID-19 or are placed on Quarantine Order as a result of their providing care to their patients.Progress in DormitoriesUp to 10,000 tests, including individual swabs, pooled swabs and serological testing, are administered daily for migrant workers.The Inter-agency Taskforce strives to clear all the dormitories in the most expedient and efficient way possible, while safeguarding the health of residents. Dormitories are prioritised based on their readiness for testing, which depends on factors including: Prevalence of infection Length of time since the onset of infection Adherence to safe distancingAs of 23 June 2020, about 120,000 workers have either recovered or have been tested to be free from the virus. Amongst the population, 80,000 are able to resume work while the rest are pending movement to appropriate accommodations before they start work. By the end of July, we expect that 80% of workers staying in the dormitories would have recovered or cleared through testing protocols.Working together for a safe transitionThe expansion of testing in the community, supported by Singapore’s healthcare networks, will help enhance disease survelliance, detect the virus early and reduce the risk of further transmission. The dormitory clearance strategy would also provide for safe return of migrant workers to the workforce. Coupled with the use of technology with TraceTogether and SafeEntry to expand contact tracing capability, these are all efforts to manage COVID-19 in Phase Two. Nonetheless, the risk of infection and spread remains and it is crucial for everyone to remain alert and follow safe management and safe distancing measures.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - Even though an umbrella cannot totally prevent you from getting wet, it is still better to have one when it rains as you will get drenched otherwise. In the same way, Covid-19 vaccines cannot completely prevent one from getting infected, but they can still lower the risk and ward off severe illness. This was the analogy offered by Communications and Information Minister Josephine Teo in a two-minute Cantonese skit with veteran actress Xiang Yun. It is part of a new video series by Gov.sg which features politicians teaming up with celebrities to encourage seniors to get their jabs. They can be viewed on the Gov.sg YouTube channel and Facebook page. Some of the videos, including Mrs Teo\\'s, racked up tens of thousands of views within a day of being posted. Other videos feature Health Minister Ong Ye Kung conversing in Mandarin with actress Zoe Tay and in Hokkien with actor Cavin Soh, and Senior Minister of State for Health and Manpower Koh Poh Koon speaking in Teochew with actor Rayson Tan. The Tamil video features Transport Minister S. Iswaran with pilot and variety show host Saravanan Ayyavoo. The Malay video sees Parliamentary Secretary for Health and Communications and Information Rahayu Mahzam teaming up with radio DJ Abdul Razak, better known as DJ RZ. The videos all address common questions on the safety and efficacy of the Covid-19 vaccines. Each video makes the point that inoculation also protects the person\\'s family members and wider society. They stress that older people are more susceptible to severe illness and complications if they catch Covid-19, and that there is no evidence the vaccines can lead to heart attacks and stroke for elderly people. For seniors worried about the inconvenience, the videos also state that those aged 60 and up can go to any vaccination centre without an appointment. Themulti-ministry task force tackling Covid-19 announced that the Government would ramp up its vaccination programme from about 47,000 doses administered daily to up to 80,000 from Saturday (June 26). During a press conference on Thursday (June 24), Mr Ong said about 75 per cent of seniors aged 60 and up had received at least one dose, but added that this was not enough. The ministers chairing the task force stressed that unvaccinated seniors remain the most vulnerable to new Covid-19 infections as Singapore continues to ease restrictions in its reopening, and urged seniors to get their jabs as soon as possible. Finance Minister Lawrence Wong noted that many of the cases in recent clusters in Bukit Merah View involved elderly people and that such outbreaks can easily happen in other areas. Trade and Industry Minister Gan Kim Yong said seniors will face greater risks as measures are eased. \"We have to be aware that once we allow more activities to resume, the risks will go up. Those who are vaccinated will continue to be protected but those who are not vaccinated, especially the seniors, will face a higher risk of infection and higher risk of severe disease.\" Join ST\\'s Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.

Of these cases, 12 are in the community and two are imported. The 12 community cases include one unlinked case. The remaining 11 are linked to existing cases, said the Ministry of Health (MOH). More details will be announced on Sunday night. On Saturday, MOH reported that an 84-year-old Singaporean woman had died from complications due to Covid-19 infection. She was tested for Covid-19 on June 15 as part of MOH's community surveillance testing for visitors to 115 and 116 Bukit Merah View, and was confirmed to have the infection on the same day. She had not been vaccinated and had a history of cancer and hypertension. The National Centre for Infectious Diseases has contacted her family and is extending assistance to them, said MOH. The Covid-19 deaths in Singapore is now 36. On Saturday,MOH also reported 13 new cases of locally transmitted Covid-19 infection, all in the community. Five of these cases were linked to previous cases and had already been placed under quarantine. Four cases were unlinked at the time. Among the new cases were three who work at Changi General Hospital - a 21-year-old nurse and two porters. The nurse has been classified as an unlinked case, while the porters, aged 48 and 66, were linked to the cluster at the hospital. There are now five cases in the cluster. Overall, MOH said the number of new cases in the community has decreased, from 109 cases in the week before to 92 cases in the past week. But the number of unlinked cases in the community has increased, from 13 cases in the week before to 19 cases in the past week. There were also four imported cases reported on Saturday, who were already placed on stay-home notice upon arrival in Singapore. Another 20 patients had been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities. There were 143 patients still in hospital and another 170 isolated and cared for at community facilities. <!--//--><![CDATA[// ><!--iFrameResize()//--><!]]> <!--//--><![CDATA[// ><!--iFrameResize()//--><!]]> Join ST's Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.

       " {'text': \"fear of complications or side effects main reason some seniors spurn covid 19 vaccine Read 3 articles daily and stand to win ST rewards, including the ST News Tablet worth $398. Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE -Retiree Tan Kian Boon, 69, is more afraid of dying from potential complications of the Covid-19 vaccine than of catching the coronavirus itself. He thinks it is unlikely he would get infected as he wears a mask when he goes out. Though he is not vaccinated, he is considering the Sinovac vaccine, which he feels is more reliable since it was developed using traditional methods. The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines that are currently available under Singapore’s national vaccination programme are based on mRNA technology, which has not been used in vaccines before now. Mr Tan said in Mandarin: “We don’t actually need a vaccine to defeat the virus. Our bodies can recover by themselves. We just need to exercise, get some sun and adjust our diets.” Mr Peh Leong Kok, too, is afraid of dying after getting vaccinated. The retired restaurant worker remembers reading that a senior citizen died after he was vaccinated, though he does not remember any other detail. Also, Mr Peh, 82, had surgery for a chronic digestive disease a few years ago, and suffers from high blood pressure and other ailments, so he is afraid of running into more problems because of the vaccine. Fear of complications or side effects from the vaccine is the key reason stopping seniors from getting vaccinated, The Straits Times found, in speaking to 35 seniors on Friday (June 25). Of those, seven were yet to be vaccinated. On Thursday, Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said about 75 per cent of people aged 60 and older had received at least one dose of the vaccine, but that this was “not enough”. The task force tackling the pandemic said seniors should protect themselves through vaccination as they are most vulnerable to the disease and face a higher risk of severe illness. Their risk will increase once safe distancing measures are gradually eased, said Trade and Industry Minister Gan Kim Yong. Seniors who have been vaccinated include Mr Ranjen Nadarajah, 65, who runs a market stall. He said he had the jab because it makes it safer for him and those around him. But there are other seniors refraining from doing the same. Mr Sunny Tan, 74, said there was no need to get vaccinated as the Government is doing such a good job of managing the pandemic that he does not worry about catching the virus. A woman who wanted to be known only as Madam Toh, 65, is the sole caregiver to her 103-year-old mother. Shehas not made an appointment for her mother, who she said is “so old already”. She, too, has not been vaccinated, although she wants to. Mr Edward Tang, who oversees two senior activity centres run by Care Corner Singapore, said news of deaths after vaccination, like those in Norway, has spooked some seniors. In January, more than 30 people in Norway aged 75 and older died after getting vaccinated. But all of them were reported to have been already seriously ill prior to getting their shots. The Norwegian health authorities have said there is no evidence of a direct link between the deaths and the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine they received. Mr Tang added that some seniors are also afraid of the usual side effects associated with the vaccine, such as fever, giddiness and a sore arm. “They want to avoid unnecessary pain and discomfort,” he said. The Silver Generation Office, the outreach arm of the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC), has been working with the People’s Association to explain to seniors the benefits of the vaccine, through phone calls and house visits. Among other things, the AIC will work with relevant agencies to vaccinate home-bound seniors in their own homes. Its spokesman said: “Most seniors engaged by the Silver Generation Office have generally been receptive towards the vaccination. Those who were less receptive were usually worried about the possibility of side effects.” In recent weeks, however, the resistance has eased, said Lions Befrienders chairman Anthony Tay, in part because of the large number of cases linked to the Bukit Merah View Market and Hawker Centre. Markets and hawker centres tend to be stomping grounds for seniors. It marked a change from last year when the outbreak was concentrated in dormitories for foreign workers. Mr Tay said: “Now they feel it has hit close to home and their fear is greater.” Besides, as more of their friends remain well after vaccination, they are also more assured and confident of the jab, he said. Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious diseases specialist from the Rophi Clinic, said that some seniors have not been vaccinated as they are waiting for the Sinovac vaccine, which they feel is safer. “Sinovac did not publish any reports on adverse effects, so some seniors think it is safer,” he said, adding that absence of published data on adverse effects does not mean there are no adverse effects. Dr Leong said he has had “dozens” of patients from Indonesia who had the Sinovac vaccine and found in subsequent antibody tests that they had little or no immune response to the virus. A Hong Kong University (HKU) study which tracked the antibody response of 1,000 people who had received either the Pfizer-BioNTech or the Sinovac vaccinealso found that people who were vaccinated with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine had “substantially higher” levels of antibodies than those who received Sinovac’s, Dr Leong said. Dr Ng Wai Chong, founder of NWC Longevity Practice, a start-up providing aged care consultancy and direct clinical services, urged seniors to be vaccinated, especially since the disease is likely to become endemic. He said the mRNA vaccines have proven to be safe and effective, with serious adverse reactions being very rare here. The chances of seniors dying from Covid-19 are higher, he noted. He added: “Even if you don’t go out so much, you still have to go out once in a while. And the best protection is still vaccination.” Join ST's Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. SPH Digital News / Copyright © 2021 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd. Co.

       " {'text': 'seniors make up almost half of covid 19 cases in bukit merah redhill clusters Read 3 articles daily and stand to win ST rewards, including the ST News Tablet worth $398. Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - Seniors make up almost half of the Covid-19 cases in the four clusters in Bukit Merah and Redhill, raising concerns about the risk of severe illness among older patients in the ageing estate who are not vaccinated. According to an analysis by The Straits Times, 46.9 per cent of the 98 cases linked to clusters in the area comprise patients aged 60 and above. The median age among all the cases is 51 and more than half - 55.1 per cent - are female. About two in five of the seniors in the clusters are not vaccinated, while the rest of the seniors have received at least one dose of the vaccine. In total, about 56.1 per cent of the cases in the four clusters have not been vaccinated. The Bukit Merah View area, where three Covid-19 clusters have emerged in recent weeks, has a higher proportion of elderly residents, said Tanjong Pagar GRC MP Joan Pereira, who oversees the GRC\\'s Henderson-Dawson ward. \"I am worried for our residents, especially whenthere are vulnerable elderly living in Bukit Merah View, and the risk of severe disease increases with age,\" she told ST on Wednesday (June 23). At the same time, she noted that not all of the cases are residents in the constituency, as they also include stallholders, visitors and their household contacts. The cluster that has attracted the most concern so far is the one at 115 Bukit Merah View Market and Hawker Centre, which has swelled to 82 cases as at Wednesday night. It is now Singapore\\'s largest open cluster, since the first case was reported on June 10. Three more clusters and unlinked cases in the vicinity have also emerged over the past week: Block 119 Bukit Merah View, with seven cases; Block 121 Bukit Merah View, with five cases; and Block 90 Redhill Close, with four cases. The once-lively Bukit Merah View neighbourhood, popular for its hawker fare, is now quiet as customers stay away. Mr Wong Ming Kee, 67, a Bukit Merah View resident who works in housekeeping at a hospital, is also concerned about a number of elderly in the neighbourhood who do not follow the rules, such as not wearing their masks properly. \"When I tell them to pull up their mask, they scold me. I\\'m worried for my own health, so I don\\'t loiter around after buying necessities,\" he said. To detect cases in the area, multiple rounds of testing operations have been organised, with 2,133 residents and visitors of eight blocks in Bukit Merah View tested. Of this group, five tested positive for Covid-19, the Ministry of Health said on Wednesday. A swabbing exercise for seven blocks in Redhill also wrapped up on Wednesday. Three residents at one of the blocks had earlier tested positive for Covid-19, forming part of the cluster at Block 90 Redhill Close announced on Tuesday. \"We are anxiously waiting for the results of the swab tests for the rest of the residents,\" Radin Mas MP Melvin Yong told ST. Ms Pereira is concerned about less mobile seniors whose grocery buying has been affected by the market\\'s closure. To help them, volunteers in the Henderson-Dawson ward have increased the frequency of meal deliveries to residents. She noted that at least three-quarters of those aged above 60 in her ward have received two doses of the vaccine. Volunteers will continue to step up efforts to encourage other seniors to go for their jabs, she added. Professor Dale Fisher, an infectious disease expert at the National University of Singapore, said vaccinated people usually have milder symptoms or are asymptomatic. As older people are more likely to have been vaccinated, this means there are fewer clinical features to aid investigations in the Bukit Merah and Redhill clusters. The virus, which has also become more transmissible, thus becomes harder to control in this period of \"partial vaccination\", he noted. Mass testing is required to find the cases and trace the virus spread, and many cases are unlinked as a result of this new transmission dynamic. \"Fortunately, most of the more vulnerable are vaccinated,\" he added. For now, Bukit Merah View resident Long Wei Ai, 80, is taking things in her stride. \"I\\'m already so old, so I\\'m not so worried about my own health,\" she said. She looks forward to going out when the situation improves. \"I just hope all this blows over soon.\" A sundry store worker, 74, is reported as an unlinked case. He later becomes the index case of a cluster at 115 Bukit Merah View Market and Hawker Centre. The newly-formed cluster grows to six cases. All staff and tenants at the market and Block 116 are to be tested. Visitors to the blocks are also offered free testing. The Block 115 cluster grows to 16 people. Mandatory testing begins for stallholders at Block 116. The market and hawker center, closed since June 13 for deep cleaning, is to be closed till June 26 as the number of cases grows. The Block 115 cluster grows to 39 people. The growing cluster is cited in reviewing the timing and scope of Singapore\\'s reopening from phase two (heightened alert). Of the 383 staff at Blocks 115 and 116, 21 test positive. Of the 4,892 visitors tested, seven testpositive. Mandatory PCR testing for staff of stalls at Redhill Market and Food Centre at 79 and 85 Redhill Lane, a few blocks away. Mandatory testing for all residents of eight blocks in Bukit Merah View, as well as voluntary testing for visitors. This comes after viral fragments are detected in wastewater samples in the vicinity. Mandatory testing for all residents of seven blocks in Redhill, as well as voluntary testing for visitors. The Block 115 cluster grows to 78 people as new clusters form at Blocks 119 and 121. The cluster at Block 115 now stands at 81. The one at Block 119 grows to six people, while the one at Block 121 grows to five. The Ministry of Health says it has concluded mandatory and voluntary testing at Bukit Merah View. Of the 2,133 residents and visitors tested, five test positive. There are now 98 cases across the four clusters, including 82 in the Block 115 cluster.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE – In February last year,as Covid-19 hit Singapore, army camps had to screen visitors by asking them to fill in paper forms, with questions such as whether they had any flu symptoms or had travelled to affected countries recently. Filling in these travel declaration forms resulted in long queues at guard rooms, which could potentially lead to the spread of the virus, said Captain Chia Teck Yeow, who is from the army’s digitalisation office. Within that month, his team developed a digital form using FormSG, a form builder tool developed by the Government Technology Agency (GovTech), to reduce human contact while keeping proper records of visitors to camps.

It now uses a Web portal so that the data collected can be better managed, with the help of the Defence Science and Technology Agency, said Capt Chia, 28. The project was one of the nine winners of the Ministry of Defence (Mindef) Dare To Do Award, which was announced by Mindef on Thursday (June 24). The award recognises efforts that have identified new ways to do things better, take measured risks and show perseverance. Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen officiated at the Innovation Symposium at Mindef’s headquarters in Bukit Gombak on Thursday, during which a small-scale awards ceremony was held. A total of 65 awards were presented to individuals, groups and units from Mindef and the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF), in recognition of their innovations and work improvement efforts. These led to savings of more than $165 million in the last financial year. In his speech, Dr Ng said he was glad that there were recipients for the innovation awards despite the Covid-19 pandemic. “It reflects a good resilience among our own people that has been cultivated within Mindef and SAF – an ethos that places national defence as a priority, whatever the circumstances, that there’s this drive for innovation and excellence, and to find better ways of doing things to improve outcomes,” he said. Examples of this innovation drive, he said, include engineers at DSO National Laboratories optimising their in-house polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test capability for the SAF to detect Covid-19 infection in its ranks, as well as add to the national capacity to do so. “It’s a capability that enabled us to plan and to execute cohorting, testing, calling back our NSmen (operationally ready national servicemen) or getting our critical units to continue their operations. It is a key asset that has kept our infection rates within the SAF down,” said Dr Ng. When the frigate RSS Supreme participated in Exercise Rimpac held in the waters off Hawaii last year, the ship was reconfigured to have its own testing capability, isolation and quarantine rooms, as well as specialised medical facilities to manage potential Covid-19 cases, Dr Ng said. Similar protocols have since been implemented for all ships as part of deployment preparations. Another project that won the Dare To Do Award was a smart padlock by the 5Air Engineering and Logistics Group from the Republic of Singapore Air Force. Instead of using conventional lock and keys, where a single key opens each lock, the team developed an electronic lock solution where a programmable key can be used to access multiple locations, such as offices or aircraft hangars, where servicemen are required to work at Tengah Air Base. This saves on the time that is usually spent hunting for the right key if another user across the airbase is holding it, said Military Expert 5 Desmond Loh, 51, an air force engineer who headed the project. This solution is also more secure, as each key’s use can be tracked, and access revoked when needed, he said. When the team came up with this idea in 2019, it knew that among the challenges was how airbase security was “strict and non-negotiable”. “However, when faced with these processes that seem inefficient, our team decided to convince the authorities that there’s indeed a better solution that, at the same time, doesn’t compromise security,” ME5 Loh said.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - Singapore has signed advance purchase agreements with American biotechnology company Novavax to secure its protein-based Covid-19 vaccine, with supplies possibly arriving before the end of the year. Singapore\\'s Health Ministry (MOH) signed the agreements with Novavax in January this year, Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said on Thursday (June 24) at a virtual press conference held by the multi-ministry task force on Covid-19. He added that MOH has been looking for vaccines of good quality, which are safe and effective, to be part of the national vaccination programme, and noted that Novavax has recently showed encouraging results. Novavax has been shown to be more than 90 per cent effective against a variety of Covid-19 variants, based on late-stage data from its clinical trial in the United States. Mr Ong said shipments of Novavax\\'s vaccines will not be ready so soon, as it is still undergoing phase threeclinical trials. \"In the meantime, please consider mRNA vaccines, they work very well,\" he added. Currently only the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, which use the mRNA technology, are offered under the vaccination programme. These vaccines teach cells to make a protein that prompts an immune response. Novavax, a protein-based vaccine, uses a laboratory-made version of the Sars-CoV-2 spike protein to stimulate an immune response. Like the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, it also requires two shots, spaced apart. Earlier this month, a study of nearly 30,000 volunteers in the US and Mexico putNovavax on track to file for emergency authorisation in the US and elsewhere in the third quarter of the year, the company said on June 14. The company added that its vaccine candidate was more than 93 per cent effective against the predominant variants of Covid-19 that have been of concern among scientists and public health officials. Protein-based vaccines are a conventional approach that uses purified pieces of the virus to spur an immune response, and long-established vaccines against whooping cough and shingles employ this approach. In Singapore, some people have opted for the Sinovac Covid-19 vaccine, which uses deactivated coronaviruses to trigger an immune response, another conventional vaccine technology. Sinovac was recently allowed for use here under the Special Access Route framework to enhance the country\\'s overall vaccination coverage, though it is not authorised for use under the Pandemic Special Access Route and is not included in the national vaccination programme. Some of the 24 private healthcare clinics which provide the Sinovac vaccine have seen long queues, with some people choosing to pay for a vaccine that uses a more conventional technology even though studies have found it less effective than the mRNA vaccines. <!--//--><![CDATA[// ><!--iFrameResize()//--><!]]> On Thursday, Singapore\\'s director of medical services Kenneth Makwas also asked about ancedotal stories of some people choosing the Pfizer over the Moderna jab, due to a supposedly higher rate of adverse reactions associated with the Moderna jab. Noting that this observation has not been borne out by data, he said: \"We have been looking at adverse events for all vaccines... and at this point in time, there is no signal to suggest a higher adverse event rate associated with Moderna.\" He added: \"We have been therefore encouraging all to get whichever vaccine is available, given supplies come in at different points in time...

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - The coronavirus pandemic has illustrated the urgent need for global cooperation on healthcare and vaccine distribution, and Singapore, as a strong supporter of vaccine multilateralism, believes in the fair and equitable distribution of vaccines, Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan said on Wednesday (June 23). He was speaking at the Asia and Pacific High-Level Conference on Belt and Road Cooperation, a videoconference chaired by his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi. It was attended by representatives from 29 countries and institutions such as the Eurasian Economic Union. In his remarks, Dr Balakrishnan stressed Singapore\\'s commitment to tackling the Covid-19 pandemic and future global health threats through international cooperationand said that fair distribution of vaccines is essential for global recovery. The Republic has also begun discussing with many partners, including China, the mutual recognition of health certificates to facilitate the safe resumption of travel, which he said is essential for a sustainable global recovery. Advancing economic integration and connectivity is also key, Dr Balakrishnan added, noting that having stable and resilient supply chains is important for ensuring the continued flow of essential goods and medical supplies. He mentioned that the China-Singapore (Chongqing) Connectivity Initiative-New International Land-Sea Trade Corridor - a link between South-east Asia and Western China - has proven to be a viable and effective alternative trade route. \"Despite the pandemic, this route has seen a 30 per cent year-on-year increase in cargo flowslast year... It is well-positioned to further enhance connectivity across and beyond the Belt and Road,\" said the minister. He also noted that the Belt and Road Initiative has fostered stronger cooperation between Singapore and China in areas such as financial connectivity, third-party collaborationsand professional services, including legal and judicial cooperation. Finally, Dr Balakrishnan urged participants not to lose sight of the existential threat of climate change, noting that Singapore is a strong advocate for the Paris Agreement, a global treaty to tackle climate change. \"The Paris Agreement was a key result of great collaboration among the United States, China, Europe, and the rest of the world. We believe that all of us need to seize the opportunity presented by Covid-19 to make a global reset to achieve a more sustainable future,\" he said. He added that Singapore has recently unveiled the Singapore Green Plan 2030, which outlines a whole-of-nation approach to sustainable development. Singapore, as co-chair of the Belt and Road Initiative International Green Development Coalition, also believes that there are many opportunities for partners to work constructively together on innovative and sustainable solutions, he added. \"The decisions we make on green recovery today will have profound long-term implications on future generations,\" said Dr Balakrishnan.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. TEL AVIV - Alarm bells were ringing in Israel on Jan 20, when the number of Covid-19 deaths crossed the 100 mark for the first time. The country had just begun its vaccination programme a month before, on Dec 19, and policymakers had been forced to impose and then extend unpopular lockdowns, in a bid to curb the spread of the disease. Now, just four months after the grim toll, the country has removed all coronavirus restrictions and is planning to welcome vaccinated tourists from overseas from August. The remarkable turnaround has been made possible by a rapid vaccine roll-out that has inoculated 58.8 per cent of its population, according to Bloomberg\\'s Vaccine Tracker. The success story of the nation of just 9.05 million people could be cause for celebration in Singapore, which has so far vaccinated 41.1 per cent of its population and aims to give two-thirds of all adult residents two doses of the vaccine by National Day. Israel\\'s success can be judged by the statistics: The country saw just 89 new cases and one death on Tuesday (June 22), down from a high of 11,934 cases on Jan 27, when 92 new deaths were recorded. The feat was made possible by Israel\\'s aggressive vaccine purchase strategy, even as other nations hesitated to administer the novel formulations. But there is evidence that the inoculation effort has stuttered in recent months. From a high of 193,000 jabs being given every day on Jan 26, the vaccination rate has now dropped to just 3,413 doses per day on average. Nevertheless, Israel\\'s achievement has allowed the country to attain some modicum of normalcy in troubled times. The vaccination drive has seen the daily positivity rate - the percentage of people who test positive for Covid-19 - at just 0.1 per cent over a seven-day period as at Monday. This marks a steep fall from Sept 30 and Oct 1 last year, when 13 per cent of all test results came back positive. Furthermore, evidence indicates that vaccinated individuals are 30 times less likely to contract Covid-19 than unvaccinated people. And should a vaccinated person get infected, the hospitalisation rate is 10 times lower than for those who did not get a jab. The hospitalisation rate across age groups for fully vaccinated people is just 0.3 per 100,000 on a daily basis, and the mortality rate is 0.1 per 100,000. The statistics were seen as enough of a reason for Israel\\'s Ministry of Health to remove all Covid-19 restrictions from the start of June, including a \"Green Pass\" system that allows greater freedoms for vaccinated people. In addition, the ministry recently announced an end to the requirement for face masks indoors, in schools and on public transportation. That is likely to give cheer to Singaporean policymakers as well, as proof of the merits of the island\\'s own vaccine strategy.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. Long Covid-19 syndrome - which sees patients suffer residual symptoms such as fatigue and chest pains weeks and months after infection - has been described in several countries, but Singapore\\'s health authorities have yet to get a firm grip on what it entails. This includes what causes \"long Covid-19\" syndrome, how it manifests and how it can be addressed, Singapore\\'s director of medical services Kenneth Mak said during a virtual media conference held yesterday by the multi-ministry task force tackling Covid-19. Associate Professor Mak noted that there are anecdotal reports which suggest vaccination provides some remedy for long Covid-19 syndrome. \"Some longstanding sufferers of long Covid-19 syndrome have reported improvements in the symptoms after vaccination. And this may potentially be another reason to encourage even recovered cases to seek vaccination,\" he said. Long Covid-19 is a condition where some people continue to experience Covid-19 symptoms for longer than usual, even after recovering from the disease. Fatigue, shortness of breath, chest pain, joint aches and \"brain fog\" - where one\\'s thinking is sluggish - are some commonly described problems that emerge or linger for four weeks or more after an infection. \"The National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) has been looking at this and has been following up on all recovered cases in Singapore\\'s public hospitals, and has also been trying to study this particular issue,\" said Prof Mak. NCID may be ready soon to provide further information on what the prevalence of long Covid-19 syndrome is in Singapore. Prof Mak said the syndrome reinforces the concern that Covid-19 infection is not something like the common seasonal flu. \"There are some patients who have severe outcomes, permanent disabilities to some extent, and these... are not something to underplay.\" Some longstanding sufferers of long Covid-19 syndrome have reported improvements in the symptoms after vaccination.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - Singapore is set to receive a batch of Covid-19 vaccines called Comirnaty, as the Republic ramps up supplies to get as many people inoculated as possible. In a statement on Wednesday (June 23), the Ministry of Health (MOH) said that the vaccines are the same as the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines that are now used in the national vaccination programme. It has the same research name BNT162b2, the MOH said. The Comirnaty vaccines are manufactured according to the same processes and procedures and meet the same finished product specifications as the Pfizer-BioNTech shots, added the ministry. They are similarly manufactured in Europe and shipped directly to Singapore. The only difference is the label. This is because the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine used in Singapore is manufactured at various sites across Europe and labelled according to the regulatory approval in the various markets, said the MOH. Thus, the ministry will be adjusting the HealthHub records of individuals who have received or will be receiving the Pfizer-BioNTech or Comirnaty vaccine. The vaccine will be labelled as Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty in the records. Moderna is the other mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid) vaccine currently used in Singapore and approved by the Health Sciences Authority (HSA). The Sinovac vaccine remains unregisteredhereand is not authorised by the HSA for use under the Pandemic Special Access Route, but itcan be administered at 24 private healthcare clinics. The Sinovac vaccine is provided only under the Special Access Route frameworkand hence will not be covered under the Vaccine Injury Financial Assistance Programme meant for the national vaccination programme. Singapore is aiming for half its residents to be fully vaccinated by Augustand at least 75 per cent by October. As at last Saturday, more than half the population have received at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccines. About 36 per cent have received the complete regimen of two doses.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - The rise in Covid-19 cases here in recent months could have been caused by more contagious variants of the coronavirus first found abroad. As at May 31, a total of 940 local and imported infections have involved a variant of concern. There are four such known variants here. The Delta variant, also known as B16172, forms the bulk of cases with variants in Singapore, at 550 patients, according to the Ministry of Health (MOH). This variant is considered more easily transmitted from human to human, and fuelled the massive spread of the virus in India. It was first picked up in India last October, but is believed to have made its way to Singapore only recently. On May 4, MOH said in a press release that there were seven local cases infected with the Delta variant in Singapore. Experts have said that the increased transmissibility of the variant means there is a possibility of a large outbreak happening whenever infected cases move about in the community. Recent evidence from Britain has suggested that the Delta variant has a reproductive number of five to eight, which is much higher than that of the wild-type variant, the original virus that the world saw early last year, which had a reproductive number of two to three. The reproductive number of a virus is the number of new infections generated by each case. The other Covid-19 variants of concern here are the Alpha variant, or B117, first detected in Britain, with 204 cases here; the Beta variant, or B1351, first found in South Africa, with 177 cases here; and the Gamma variant, or P1, first detected in Brazil, with nine cases here.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - As June 13 draws closer, one question looms large on Singaporeans\\' minds: How far will the current strict rules on social gatherings be relaxed, given that Covid-19 cases in the community have steadily decreased over the past month? Any changes are likely to be calibrated and gradual, say public health experts, with a balance struck between easing the pressure on hard-hit sectors and preventing another uptick in Covid-19 transmission. Associate Professor Alex Cook, vice-dean of research at the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health at the National University of Singapore (NUS), said: \"Ever since the circuit breaker last year, the Government has acted gradually and cautiously in relaxing measures. \"This, I believe, is because if we relax measures too much, the transmissibility of the virus may increase to a level at which exponential growth resumes.\" On May 14, the Health Ministry announced that dining in would be banned and social gatherings capped at two for nearly a month, among other tightened measures put in place following a rise in the number of locally transmitted cases. The new rules, which essentially set Singapore back to phase two of its reopening, kicked in on May 16. That day, the country saw 38 new community cases, 17of which were unlinked to any other case. This is a far cry from the present situation. On Wednesday (June 9), Singapore reported just two new community cases, one of which is unlinked. Size limits on social gatherings had been reduced from eight to five people on May 8, four months after Singapore entered phase three of its reopening. Just over a week later, as community cases continued to rise, the rules were further tightened suchthat people could gather only in groups of two. The stricter measures were initially slated to end on June 13, although Finance Minister Lawrence Wong, who co-chairs the multi-ministry task force tackling the pandemic, said last week that the country is unlikely to return to phase three of its reopening immediately. He had earlier announced an $800 million support package to help businesses and workers cope with the impact of these measures. The task force is expected to give an update soon. Professor Teo Yik Ying, who is dean of NUS\\'Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, noted that the latest numbers are a positive sign. The country can therefore afford to lift some restrictions - perhaps allowing some degree of dining in and permitting a portion of workers to return to the office, he said. For instance, the maximum size of social gatherings could be increased to five, with up to 50 per cent of staff allowed back at work under split-team arrangements. In making their decision, the authorities will have to consider two attributes of every activity - its risk and its economic or social importance, Prof Cook said. Activities where masks must be removed, for example, would be considered higher risk. Meanwhile, activities of higher importance include those that benefit the economy or individuals\\' mental well-being. \"Determining which activities or events are allowed involves working out which combination of activities keeps the total risk tolerable, but brings a good overall benefit,\" Prof Cook said. He added that one thing to consider would be how vaccination changes the overall picture. For instance, Singapore may choose to relax restrictions for students more quickly, should enough of them get vaccinated before school reopens. The experts drew attention to the difficulties caused by the current restrictions, especially for those in the food and beverage industry, as well as private-hire car and taxi drivers. But they also noted that Singapore remains vulnerable once the rules are eased, given the transmissibility of new variants of the coronavirus. \"We have seen how quickly transmission chains can expand, seeding up to four generations of spread within a span of two weeks,\" Prof Teo pointed out. \"This means even as we lift some of the restrictions, this has to be done so in a cautious, calibratedand phased manner.\" Professor Paul Tambyah, president of the Asia-Pacific Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infection, said a careful examination of the data is key to deciding where restrictions can be most relaxed. For instance, some recent clusters have emerged in “closed working environments in essential services”, such as fast-food outlets or barber shops. These are difficult to shut down, and thus the strategy in such settings should shift to identifying groups to “jump the queue” for vaccination, he said. More work also needs to be done to understand how transmission might be happening in Housing Board blocks, where several clusters have also been found, Prof Tambyah added. “If more outbreaks are occurring at home, it does not make sense to tell people to stay at home.” Sembawang GRC MP Lim Wee Kiak, who sits on the Government Parliamentary Committee for Health, acknowledged the risks but also pointed out that many people are looking forward to meeting their loved ones in person. \"I hope the (multi-ministry) task force will lift restrictions on dining in, so we can look forward to Father\\'s Day celebrations at restaurants and hawker centres,\" he said.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - Since about a month ago, when Covid-19 cases were first detected at Block 506 Hougang Avenue 8, Madam Goh Ai Kim has seen a 70 per cent drop in footfall at the foot reflexology shop she works at in nearby Block 684. \"The Block 506 cluster has had a very big impact on our business. Virtually no one enters the shop from morning till evening, maybe because they are scared to go out,\" said the 74-year-old massage therapist in Mandarin. \"I feel very discouraged as I am paid by commission. I don\\'t feel like working any more, but I have nowhere else to go. With so few customers, I just watch videos on my phone or nap to pass the time.\" The 13 cases linked to the cluster at Block 506, as well as another three individuals linked to the Changi Airport cluster who also live in the block, triggered a series of intensive testing operations in Hougang over the past month. Residents and visitors to Block 506 had to undergo mandatory testing on May 21 and 22, as did those at Blocks 501 and 507 from June 1 to June 3. Three people later tested positive, out of the 1,233 tested across the three blocks. The Block 506 cluster has not seen any new cases since June 1. In a mandatory second round of testing from June 4 to 6 for residents of Block 506 and shop staff at seven neighbouring blocks, all 1,413 tested negative. Free testing was also offered to visitors of Block 506 as well as residents of and visitors to the seven other blocks from June 4 till Thursday (June 17), when the voluntary testing operation wrapped up. None of the 4,384 individuals who volunteered to be tested by June 10 were positive for Covid-19. Like Madam Goh, many workers at shops in the neighbourhood felt the cluster and the testing operations had affected business. Many said they had seen significant drops in traffic and in revenue - of up to 70 per cent - compared with before the cluster emerged. A man in his 60s, who owns a shop in one of the blocks that had to undergo testing, said his revenue has fallen about 70 per cent compared with two months ago. \"Honestly, I\\'ve faced a lot of pressure in the last year. I\\'ve had to draw on my savings to pay rent every month. It\\'s not fair for those of us who cannot get government aid like hawkers can,\" said the man, who did not want to be named. He said he could not bear to close the shop that he had been running for more than 30 years. A coffee shop supervisor who gave her name as Ah Gun said daily revenue had fallen to about $400 to $500 a day, compared with about $2,000 before the Covid-19 pandemic. Mr Darryl David, the Ang Mo Kio GRC MP for the ward where some of the affected blocks are located, said the area is usually a bustling centre of activity. He said he was not surprised to hear that some of the confirmed cases from Block 506 in the neighbouring ward had gone over to the shops in Hougang Village, as the area is called. \"Hougang Village has a (FairPrice) supermarket, it\\'s got a wet market, and there are six coffee shops there. It\\'s a very well patronised area - not just by the residents of those blocks but also those from all the blocks nearby.\" He added: \"We\\'ve done the best we can to make sure that we sanitised this place as quickly as possible. Once people understand that there\\'s no real major spread, hopefully, they will slowly come back with some confidence.\" He said it is difficult to say how much of the recent impact on businesses was due to the heightened alert measures that began on May 16, including a ban on dining in. Despite the fallout for businesses, some residents in the area told The Straits Times they understood the need for the testing operations and were not worried for themselves. Mr Harish Mehra, 42, a resident of Block 688, was spotted playing ball games with his son and brother near his home. \"We don\\'t go to any other places.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - As at the end of May, 550 Covid-19 cases in Singapore were infected with the Delta variant of the coronavirus first detected in India. This figure comprises428 local and 122 imported cases, the Ministry of Health (MOH) told The Straits Times. It did not say when the first case was detected but an infection on April 28 was later attributed to the Delta variant or B16172. The Delta variant is considered more easily transmitted from human to human, and was what fuelled the massive spread of the virus in India. This variant was first picked up in India last October, but is believed to have made its way to Singapore only recently. On May 4, MOH said in a press release that there were seven local cases infected with the Delta variant in Singapore.Last month, Singapore saw a total of 906 Covid-19 cases, of which 524 were local community infections. The Deltavariant is also believed to have sparked the Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) cluster, which was on June 6 reported as closed after no new transmissionswere linked to it for 28 days. Three deaths were linked to the cluster, including an 86-year-old Singaporean woman who died on June 7 from complications due to Covid-19. An MOH spokesman told ST that variants are detected through viral genomic sequencing. This is done at the National Public Health Laboratory at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases for all confirmed Covid-19 cases, she said, unlike other countries which typically sequence a smaller proportion of their confirmed cases. MOH figures also show that the number of local Delta variant cases in Singapore is the highest caused by a variant of concern, among four such variants that have been detected here. Variants of concern are more easily transmitted from person to person. As at May 31, a total of 449 local cases of infection involve a variant of concern. They include: - 428 people infected with the Delta variant - Seven people infected with the Alpha variant, first detected in Britain - Nine people infected with the Beta variant, first detected in South Africa - Five people infected with the Gamma variant, first detected in Brazil “But we have adapted our measures accordingly and the number of locally transmitted cases has decreased over the last two weeks,” the MOH spokesman said. “Studies are ongoing to get a more complete understanding of these variants and we will adjust our strategies as more information is made available.” Singapore has stepped up its testing, contact tracing and vaccination programme to keep the situation under control, the spokesman added. Genomic sequencing refers to the technique used by public health authorities and researchers to “read” the genetic sequence of a pathogen. While the genetic code of the pathogen that causes Covid-19 is largely the same, variants will show slight differences in their genetic code. Since this sequence is unique to each variant, this technique allows the authorities and scientists to identify them. Associate Professor Raymond Lin, director of the National Public Health Laboratory, said Singapore’s sequencing efforts have been focused on helping to determine the chain of transmission leading to clusters of cases. “By understanding that, we try to interrupt or reduce such transmission,” he said. Dr Sebastian Maurer-Stroh, executive director of the Agency for Science, Technology and Research’s Bioinformatics Institute, added that the high frequency of the Delta variant in Singapore is to be expected. “There was one big cluster of the Delta variant locally, and many regional travellers carry the Delta variant, so the relative frequency is high in Singapore,” he said.In Singapore, the variant surfaced in the two biggest community clusters in recent months – in Changi Airport and Tan Tock Seng Hospital. Among the seven Delta Covid-19 cases reported in Singapore as at May 4, five were part of the TTSH cluster – which had by then grown to include 40 hospital staff, patients and their relatives. Dr Maurer-Stroh said that relative frequencies in small countries with few cases are often biased towards one variant. “As clusters are controlled better, the number of cases, and hence genomic sequences, is reduced until only one virus genome is reported,” he said. “A rise in relative frequency accompanied by reduced case numbers in Singapore, which has a strong surveillance system, actually shows success in controlling the virus,” he added.

The Straits Times writers pay tribute to Singapore’s front-liners – from nurses to taxi drivers, cleaners to food delivery riders – who place duty before self and even go the extra mile. An organised calm was my welcome home last Sunday night at Changi Airport. Go left, join this line, sit down, be tested. Order amid tension is reassuring. I had arrived from Delhi and was greeted in the terminal by a stream of front-line workers, who spend their days dealing with visitors from disparate lands. I wondered, are they nervous? I would be. Under those gloves, gowns and masks were humans, after all. They had families and futures. They had read the papers and knew about clusters and strains. Still all I got from them was evenness, generosity and courtesy. They were bound by duty. READ MORE HERE On the 20th night of my 21-day quarantine, my ceiling started leaking. Fat blobs of water appeared under the false ceiling housing the air-conditioning vent, eventually hitting the carpet of my Swissotel Stamford room at a rhythm that seemed to quicken with the minute. But I was in the middle of an important videoconference call. I dragged my trash bin under the leaking spot, hoping it would hold out for an hour or two, but quickly realised the situation was urgent.

Worried about the lack of protein in her diet, I decided to order and have delivered to her fish collagen soup, which is easier to swallow. The soup comes in vacuum-sealed cups. Upon hearing about my mother, the staff at the company - AO Broth - took it upon themselves to shrink-wrap each cup for added hygiene.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - There were five new Covid-19 community cases reported at noon on Monday (June 7), said the Ministry of Health (MOH). This is the lowest number of community infections since May 10, when there were three community cases. There were also nine imported cases who had been placed on stay-home notice on arrival in Singapore, said MOH. Of these, five are Singaporeans or permanent residents. In total, 14 new coronavirus cases were confirmed on Monday, taking Singapore’s total to 62,210. More details will be announced on Monday night. On Sunday, the MOH reported 20 coronavirus cases, of whom six are in the community and 14 imported. The sole unlinked community case announced on Sunday was a 13-year-old student ofPaya Lebar Methodist Girls\\' School in Hougang. She developed anosmia - or the loss of the sense of smell - on May 29 but did not seek treatment until last Friday. Her test result came back positive last Saturday. The six community cases were the lowest since May 10, when there were three community cases. Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said on Sunday that Singapore is heading in the right direction, with the number of infections dropping further in the past week. The remaining five community cases reported on Sunday were linked to previous patients and already in quarantine. Two children were linked to the cluster involving industrial machinery and equipment supplier Tektronix Southeast Asia, which now has seven cases. They are family members as well as household contacts of previous patients. They are a 13-year-old Canberra Secondary School student and a 10-year-old Endeavour Primary School pupil. A 50-year-old machine operator was added to the NTUC Foodfare (308 Anchorvale Road) cluster, bringing its total to 12. A 29-year-old Pizza Hut (Bukit Merah) delivery rider staying at Wanderloft Capsule Hostel was added to the McDonald\\'s delivery riders cluster, taking its total to 23. He was swabbed at a general practitioner clinic on May 22 and tested negative. That same day, he was identified as a close contact of previous cases and placed in quarantine. The delivery rider is asymptomatic and his infection was detected during testing last Saturday. The lastcommunity case was a 79-year-old woman who is linked to a new cluster of three associated with an 82-year-old retiree. Overall, the number of new cases in the community has fallen to 116 cases in the past week, from 136 cases in the week before. The number of unlinked cases in the community has decreased from 23 cases to 17 over the same period. <!--//--><![CDATA[// ><!--iFrameResize()//--><!]]> The Tan Tock Seng Hospital and Pasir Panjang clusters have also been closed, after no new cases were linked to them for 28 days. Mr Ong noted that the percentage of infected people detected during quarantine has risen from 57 per cent to 73 per cent. \"This means very little chance for them to move around and spread to others,\" he said. Unlinked cases - which Mr Ong previously called the most worrying group - have fallen from 18 per cent to 15 per cent of new cases. \"Let\\'s keep it up,\" he said.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - Eleven new Covid-19 cases were confirmed on Sunday (June 20), including five unlinked community cases that consist of a financial consultant, a dental assistant, a HousingBoard engineerand two retirees. This is the highest number of unlinked cases since June 12, when five unlinked cases were also reported. The youngest is a 22-year-old woman who works at Q&M Dental Surgery at Redhill MRT station, and who wears full personal protection equipment at work, said the Ministry of Health (MOH). The HDB engineer is a 52-year-old man who was detected as part of the Bukit Merah View community testing. He was last at work on May 13. Two cases, one linked and one unlinked, did not seek medical attention when they developed respiratory symptoms. An 83-year-old woman, whose case is currently unlinked, had a fever and cough on June 16 but did not seek treatment until June 18, when she was taken to the National University Hospital and tested positive for Covid-19. Her family member, an 81-year-old woman, developed a cough and fatigue on June 18 but did not seek medical attention. She, however, participated in the MOH-offered free testing for those who visited 115 and 116 Bukit Merah View on June 19 and was placed in quarantine the same day. She has tested preliminarily for the Delta variant. Meanwhile, the cluster at Bukit Merah View food centre and market has grown to 73 people, up from 70 on Saturday. All three new cases were already in quarantine when they tested positive for the coronavirus. All three had taken tests that first returned negative for Covid-19. Among them is a 35-year-old stall assistant at Tiong Bahru Yong Tao Hu who had tested negative in both antigen rapid and polymerase chain reaction tests for Covid-19 when he sought treatment at a clinic for respiratory symptoms on June 14. He was later quarantined on June 15 after he was identified as a workplace contact of others in the cluster, and then tested positive in a subsequent polymerase chain reaction test on June 19. There were two imported cases, who returned from Saudi Arabia and Indonesia. Both had been placed on stay-home notice upon arrival in Singapore. In total, there were 11 new confirmed cases of the coronavirus on Sunday, taking Singapore's total to 62,414. MOH said there were 108 community cases in the past week, up from 36 in the week before. The number of unlinked cases has also risen from 15 two weeks ago to 21 in the past week. Currently, 142 confirmed cases are still in hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, although one is in critical condition in the intensive care unit. Another 196 are isolated and cared for at community facilities, where patients who have mild symptoms or are clinically well but still test positive for the virus recuperate. Singapore has had 34 deaths from Covid-19 complications, while 15 who tested positive have died of other causes. <!--//--><![CDATA[// ><!--iFrameResize()//--><!]]> <!--//--><![CDATA[// ><!--iFrameResize()//--><!]]> Join ST's Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. The coronavirus pandemic has illustrated the urgent need for global cooperation on healthcare and vaccine distribution, and Singapore, as a strong supporter of vaccine multilateralism, believes in the fair and equitable distribution of vaccines, the Republic\\'s Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan said on Wednesday. He was speaking at the Asia and Pacific High-Level Conference on Belt and Road Cooperation, chaired by his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi via videoconference. It was attended by representatives from 29 countries and institutions such as the Eurasian Economic Union. In his remarks, Dr Balakrishnan stressed Singapore\\'s commitment to tackling Covid-19 and future global health threats through international cooperation and said fair distribution of vaccines is essential for global recovery. The Republic has also begun discussions with many partners, including China, on the mutual recognition of health certificates to facilitate the safe resumption of travel, he said. Advancing economic integration and connectivity is also key, Dr Balakrishnan added, noting that having stable and resilient supply chains is important for ensuring the continued flow of essential goods and medical supplies. He said the China-Singapore (Chongqing) Connectivity Initiative - New International Land-Sea Trade Corridor, a link between South-east Asia and western China, has proven to be a viable and effective alternative trade route. \"Despite the pandemic, this route has seen a 30 per cent year-on-year increase in cargo flows last year... It is well positioned to further enhance connectivity across and beyond the Belt and Road,\" said the minister. He also noted that the Belt and Road Initiative has fostered stronger cooperation between Singapore and China in areas such as financial connectivity, third-party collaborations and professional services, including legal and judicial cooperation. Finally, Dr Balakrishnan urged participants not to lose sight of the existential threat of climate change, noting that Singapore is a strong advocate of the Paris Agreement, a global treaty to tackle climate change. \"The Paris Agreement was a key result of great collaboration between the United States, China, Europe, and the rest of the world. We believe that all of us need to seize the opportunity presented by Covid-19 to make a global reset to achieve a more sustainable future,\" he said. He noted that Singapore recently unveiled the Singapore Green Plan 2030, which outlines a whole-of-nation approach to sustainable development. Singapore, as co-chair of the Belt and Road Initiative International Green Development Coalition, also believes there are many opportunities for partners to work constructively together on innovative and sustainable solutions, he added. \"The decisions we make on green recovery today will have profound long-term implications on future generations.\" Join ST\\'s Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.

SINGAPORE - From Monday (June 21), those who want to visit patients warded at Singapore General Hospital (SGH) for longer than 20 minutes will be required to take a Covid-19 antigen rapid test (ART). This includes registered caregivers of warded patientsand a negative test result is required before visitors are allowed entry into the wards, SGH said in a Facebook post on Sunday. Results from self-testing kits will not be accepted, but visitors may show the results of a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test taken in the past 24 hours. Testing is freeand test results will be valid for only the day of the visit. The tests will be conducted at the ART centre located in SGH\\'s Bowyer Blockand test results will be ready in 20 minutes, said the hospital. Upon clearing the test, thevisitor will be given a sticker and can then proceed to the wardto visit the patient. SGH said the testing is in keeping with the nationwide easing of Covid-19 restrictions from Monday. \"With the easing of restrictions, it is important to engage in proactive screening in order to ensure that our patients and staff members remain safe,\" said the hospital. For existing inpatients, their designated caregivers will receive an SMS with information about undergoing the ART. Newly admitted patients and their caregivers will be provided information upon admission.

SINGAPORE - You wake up with the slightest case of a runny nose. Mental note: Put on a mask before you leave for the airport - not that it\\'s a must, but just to be safe. After breakfast, you whip out Temasek\\'s newest do-it-yourself Covid-19 test kit, bought over the counter at Guardian pharmacy. Everyone at home breathes negative. You submit the results as part of the advance check-in process. Also required: Proof of the latest vaccine booster shots - updated for fresh variants - that the family got at the polyclinic yesterday. Over lunch at Changi Airport\\'s new open-air foodcourt, you log on to the Ministry of Education website to confirm that leave has been applied for both children. No more fixed school holidays - the idea still takes some getting used to. You don\\'t need to take leave, though - not since your employer\\'s new outcome-based KPIs, which do not dictate how and where the job gets done. On the plane, you recline into your economy-class seat, in a cabin now reconfigured to be roomier - or as they used to say back in 2021, \"safely distanced\". Before takeoff, you double-check the booking for your Bangkok hotel, recommended for its certification of five Covid-safety stars. It\\'s all systems go - for your first holiday in eight years. This could be life with Covid-19 endemic - as envisioned and told to Insight by experts across fields spanning infectious disease, public health, education and tourism. They note the possibility of fundamental changes to how Singaporeans play, heal, study, work and engage with one another. With the transition to this future bound to be filled with uncertainty and unpredictability; Singaporeans must meet the challenge by being adaptable and versatile. Dr Adrian W. J. Kuah, director of the futures office at the National University of Singapore (NUS), offers a starting point: Embrace what is coming as \"late-Covid-19\", rather than \"post-Covid-19\" - which suggests the unlikely chance of eradicating the virus. In a national address on Monday, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said he neither expects Covid-19 to disappear nor for it to dominate lives. He outlined a new normal where Singaporeans find ways to carry on with the virus in their midst. This also means accepting local infections and outbreaks from time to time. Associate Professor Jeremy Lim, director of global health at the NUS Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, says this acceptance level - or risk threshold of, for instance, the number of yearly deaths - will determine the extent of public health measures. Dr Oliver Morgan, director of the World Health Organisation\\'s (WHO) department of health emergency information and risk assessment, says governments should adopt a judicious blend of measures, rather than an \"on-off switch\" alternating between strict and relaxed limits. Mask wearing is one measure experts wish will no longer be mandated, yet remain as a good habit and social norm. \"I hope that we can migrate to how the Japanese wear masks - when they have a cold or flu; and to prevent spread to others,\" says Associate Professor Alex Cook, who is also from the Saw Swee Hock School. Professor Leo Yee Sin, executive director of the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID), says testing, contact tracing, isolation, vaccination and social responsibility should remain key strategies. On vaccines, Professor Paul Tambyah, president of the Asia-Pacific Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infection, hopes the new infrastructure built up by the Covid-19 response can be combined with the yearly flu jab. This would enable what Prof Lim calls \"one shot for everything\". In social settings, the experts point to urban design and planning as preferred tools to managing Covid-19, compared with distancing restrictions that come at a cost to businesses. As an alternative to air-conditioning, Prof Lim suggests engineering high ceilings, large open windows and cross-ventilation as natural cooling methods. Dr Woo Jun Jie from NUS\\' Institute of Policy Studies, who researches urban policy, says other measures include better air filtration systems, reducing the occupancy load of malls, improving crowd circulation in public transport hubs, and even safe evacuation routes for infected people. Overseas travel is expected to resume. Last month, the International Air Transport Association said global air travel would bounce back strongly by 2023, surpassing pre-Covid-19 levels. PM Lee said on Monday that visitors would again come to Singapore, and Singaporeans would travel again, if only to countries where the disease is under control. Tourism consultant Christopher Khoo believes planes and cruise ships will, for some time, continue to be perceived as viral \"petri dishes\", even as they overhaul systems and safety measures. Vacation tour itineraries and programmes will have to be planned down to the last detail, with slots pre-booked at attractions and eateries, he says. As PM Lee also predicted, this time in a BBC interview in March: \"It won\\'t be like before when you can just buy a ticket, hop onto the plane and go off to Hong Kong or Bangkok or Bali for a weekend.\" Experts are also thinking beyond home-based learning and work from home. Dr Kuah from NUS notes the repercussions of school ceasing to be at a fixed location. \"We are looking now at a generation that didn\\'t get to play team sports, experience campfires... First dates, first surreptitious brush of one\\'s hand against another\\'s, forming friendships for life - where will these take place?\" He also warns that teaching could risk becoming even more transactional, and reduced to delivery of content. \"How effectively can we educate if we can\\'t make that human connection?\" Last month, Education Minister Chan Chun Sing stressed the need to find new, safe ways for students to keep learning in a physical environment as far as possible. Professor Paulin Straughan, a sociologist at Singapore Management University, was more sanguine about the future of work. Should offices increasingly disappear, taking physical meetings with them, the businesses that will thrive are those able to foster cultures centred on strong trust in employees, she says. Done right, this could result in better control over individual time, and even rewarding relationships with co-workers and supervisors. She feels Singaporeans need to step up as active stakeholders in the community too. \"We shouldn\\'t have to rely on safe distancing ambassadors any more.\" Dr Woo notes that citizens and policymakers will need to accept that governments do not have all the solutions. Going forward, governments may need to rewrite parts of their policy playbooks. Prof Leo thinks countries will have to stand together more. \"There needs to be equitable access to healthcare, personal protective equipment, vaccines, technology, information sharing, data sharing, surveillance and the ability to ramp up research.\" NUS\\' Dr Lim believes Singapore\\'s health system capacity needs to be bolstered. \"Is one NCID enough, or do we need two? The difficulty is, as the saying goes, generals are always fighting the last war.

       " {'text': 'should singapore offer lottery draws to boost covid 19 vaccination rate Read 3 articles daily and stand to win ST rewards, including the ST News Tablet worth $398. Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - Cows, scholarships and million-dollar lottery draws - governments around the world have dangled these and other incentives in front of their citizens to help them overcome vaccine hesitancy and give national Covid-19 vaccination drives a booster shot. While Singapore has been making steady progress on the vaccination front, some observers have asked whether offering people additional incentives could help accelerate its pace. At least one organisation here has embarked on a campaign to offer benefits to Singapore residents who have been vaccinated. The Minmed Group, which runs four Covid-19 vaccine centres here, has launched an online platform - iamvaccinated.sg - where local businesses can offer discounts and promotions to those who have received their shots. While some observers believe incentives could nudge those who are still hesitant, others said implementing such a scheme now could be seen as rewarding late adopters and that it could diminish the intrinsic motivation to get the jab out of a sense of social responsibility. The Singapore Government has so far relied mostly on providing up-to-date and accurate information on the vaccine to convince Singaporeans to take the jab. Leaders here have also urged citizens to go for the shot. Last Monday, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, in his national address, made a direct appeal to 280,000 seniors who have yet to book a slot to do so. But other countries have not stopped at educational and information campaigns to convince their citizens to get vaccinated. In the US state of Ohio, for instance, the state government is incentivising Americans to get vaccinated with cash prizes from a Vax-A-Million lottery totalling US$5 million (S$6.6 million) and another US$600,000 going to scholarships for vaccinated teens. The idea of providing incentives, including lottery draws, has gained traction among some here, including Associate Professor Jeremy Lim from the National University of Singapore\\'s (NUS) Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health. Noting that Singapore is grappling with its most severe challenge since independence, he said offering incentives would allow the Government to make the vaccine benefits tangible, short of mandating the shots. Prof Lim added that such incentives are complementary to robust public health education and engagement. Albert Winsemius Chair Professor of Economics Euston Quah of Nanyang Technological University said an economic argument can be made to provide incentives for vaccination, as people who have been vaccinated reduce medical and health costs for society. \"The more people are vaccinated, the greater the likelihood that the pandemic will end. Thus, this group of vaccinated people confers a positive external effect on society compared with people who do not get vaccinated,\" he said. \"(Such incentives) reduce a possible market failure in not leaving such important public health implications and costs to individual decisions per se.\" Other observers, such as Associate Professor Lim Poh Lian, director of the High Level Isolation Unit at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases, were more cautious about the signals that incentives could send. She noted that there are currently more than 40 active Covid-19 clusters in Singapore and that cases have been recorded in malls, tuition centres and public housing. \"So, the urgent need to get vaccinated has become quite obvious to most people,\" she said. Prof Lim added that financial incentives, as an extrinsic motivator, tend to weaken intrinsic motivation. \"When those who got vaccinated out of a sense of duty (intrinsic motivation) see other people getting cash in order to get vaccinated, they get cynical. The next time you call on them to do something out of duty, they may well ask, \\'How much are you going to pay me?\\'\" NUS sociologist Tan Ern Ser said that while cash would likely help nudge people into doing what they might be reluctant to do, it could also establish an unhealthy expectation. Yio Chu Kang MP Yip Hon Weng saidthat offering an incentive for vaccination might send a signal that the vaccines are somehow undesirable or unsafe, hence needing incentives to encourage uptake. Instead of incentives, he suggested that the Government consider bundling health check-ups with vaccination appointments, or offering the remaining unvaccinated members of the household to be vaccinated together, so that household transmission could be further reduced. But NUS\\' Prof Jeremy Lim said concerns about unhappy precedents being set and the public expecting future incentives are unwarranted. \"We are in a crisis situation and we should be bold, doing whatever it takes to get us to the required population vaccination numbers,\" he said. Sembawang GRC MP Mariam Jaafar said that while incentives can provide a \"short-term boost\" to the vaccination rate, multiple strategies including subsidising some alternative vaccines and tailoring communication to specific needs are needed. A retired tuition teacher, who wanted to be known only as Mrs Chia, disagreed with handing out cash vouchers or lottery tickets to encourage vaccinations. The 68-year-old had hesitated taking the jab due to concerns about its safety. She decided to get it only in late April after being repeatedly urged by her children. \"I will be very disappointed with the Government if it takes such an approach. The decision to take the vaccine is a serious matter, and we should be educating the public properly about it instead of treating it like some kind of game,\" said Mrs Chia. Ohio is offering lottery draw chances for those who get inoculated against Covid-19, and some other American states have followed suit. California is offering US$100 million (S$132 million) in US$50 prepaid cards for the next two million newly vaccinated people and US$16.5 million in cash prizes for all vaccinated Californians. In Oregon and Colorado, those who have received at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine by a prescribed date are automatically entered into lottery draws where they can win up to US$1 million. The Hong Kong authorities have also dangled a vaccine lottery featuring a new flat worth HK$10.8 million (S$1.84 million), which has reportedly led to a surge in vaccine bookings since the lottery was announced on May 28. Not to be outdone, the mayor of a farming town near Manila has promised to raffle a cow each month from September to get his constituents to take vaccine shots from Russia or China. Here in Singapore, the Minmed Group recently launched an initiative where residents can enjoy special privileges such as discounts and cash vouchers from merchants by showing their HealthHub vaccination record. The initiative is supported by public healthcare technology agency Integrated Health Information Systems. At least 40 merchants have joined the initiative so far. Ms Inez Lim, the founder of Kittea, a tea retailer which is a participating merchant under this scheme, believes life could start going back to a new normal when a significant proportion of the population has been vaccinated. \"Everyone loves a good discount, and if enough brands come on board, the pull factor can be appealing enough to overcome any minor fears people may have about getting their jabs,\" she said.

       " {'text': 'b1617 will not be the last strain of the virus seen to be increasingly dominant Read 3 articles daily and stand to win ST rewards, including the ST News Tablet worth $398. Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - The B1617 Covid-19 variant is becoming increasingly dominant worldwide and could worsen the pandemic - especially in countries with low vaccination rates - experts said in their latest assessment of the virus. And this will not be the last time that the virus mutates, the experts added. Professor Teo Yik Ying, dean of the National University of Singapore\\'s (NUS) Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, told The Straits Times on Saturday (May 29): \"What is frightening is the speed at which this variant is able to spread and circulate widely within the community, often surpassing the capability of contact-tracing units to track and isolate exposed contacts to break the transmission chains. \"It has the potential to unleash a bigger pandemic storm than the world has previously seen.\" B1617 has mutated to spread more easily from person to person, and may dampen the protection conferred by vaccines as well as natural infection, though only slightly, experts say. The variant, which was first detected in India in October 2020, is now found everywhere. World Health Organisation (WHO) chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan said that B1617 is 1.5 times to two times more transmissible than the strain that first appeared in Wuhan 18 months ago. It is now present in more than50 countries and is surpassing other strains causing infectionsin India, such as the B117. \"On clinical severity, it\\'s a little less clear because there have not been controlled studies which look at patients that you control for multiple factors, and then look at the impact of the strain on the clinical profile,\" Dr Soumya said at a recent webinar organised by the NUS\\'Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine. Dr Soumya also said that anecdotal evidence seems to indicate that more young people in India had been infected and became seriously ill. In India, more than 27 million people have been infected with Covid-19, and over 325,000 have died. In Singapore, the variant has surfaced in the two biggest community clusters in recent months - in Changi Airport and Tan Tock Seng Hospital. There are three versions of B1617 -B16171, B16172 and B16173. The second version is the most relevant as it has appeared to overtake B16171 in local cases as well as those reported globally. The third version, B16173, is rare. At this point in time, it remains unclear if B1617 causes more serious illness or deaths even though it is more infectious and transmissible. The best weapon remains widespread vaccination, Prof Teo said. Vaccinated individuals have a reduced chance of being infected, and a much lower likelihood of developing severe symptoms even if they are infected, Prof Teo said. Preliminary research in the United States carried out by the NYU Grossman School of Medicine and NYU Langone Centreshowed that the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines should remain effective against B1617. A study by Public Health England also showed that the vaccines by Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca work against B16172. The study, conducted from April 5 to May 16, found that the Pfizer-BioNTech shot was 88 per cent effective against the B16172 variant two weeks after the second dose. Two doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine were 60 per cent effective. But, with an outbreak on this scale, this will not be the only new variant of the pathogen, underscoring the urgency of vaccinations to confer some sort of immunity on the global community. Most countries, unfortunately, are lagging far behind in vaccinating their people. WHOEuropean director Hans Kluge warned on Friday that the pandemic will not be over until at least 70 per cent of people are vaccinated. He deplored the roll-out in Europe, saying that while it was better it was still \"too slow\". The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control said some 43 per cent of adults in the European Union and European Economic Area have received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine as of Saturday . \"Time is against us,\" Dr Kluge warned, stressing the need to accelerate the immunisation campaign. Worldwide, too, the situation is not looking good. The New York Times reported that more than 1.81 billion vaccine doses had been administered worldwide as at Friday (May 28), but a stark gap between vaccination programmes in countries remains, with some yet to report a single dose. Global inequity in vaccine supplies and distribution persists, and the opportunity for widespread vaccination remains a privilege for advanced economies, Prof Teo said. Professor Dale Fisher, chair of the WHO\\'s Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network, said this means a higher chance of B1617 creeping into countries previously minimally affected by Covid-19. \"These countries, such as Thailand, Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam, are more vulnerable due to the low vaccination rates, leaving them more susceptible to severe disease,\" Prof Fisher added. He urged wealthier nations to lend more support to the WHO-backed Covax programme, a global project to secure and distribute vaccines to poorer countries. With more than 3,000 mutations and counting, more virulent strains might emerge in countries where pandemic control is lacking, Prof Teo said. Even in Vietnam, which had a good handle on the virus but saw a spike in cases in May, the authorities have detected a new variant that is a combination of the B16172 and B117 variants, and spreads quickly by air, VietnameseHealth Minister Nguyen Thanh Long said on Saturday. Vietnam will soon publish genomic data of the newly identified variant, which replicated very quickly in the laboratory. This could explain why so many new cases have appeared in different parts of the country in a short period of time. Prof Fisher said Singapore seems to have managed to curtail the potentially devastating outcome of B1617 sweeping through the community because of its strong public health measures and high vaccination rates. But Singapore will not be totally safe until the rest of the world is - something which will happen only if more is done globally to get all people vaccinated, he added.

       " {'text': 'delta variant of covid 19 could have contributed to spread at wet markets experts Read 3 articles daily and stand to win ST rewards, including the ST News Tablet worth $398. Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - Wet markets can fit a large number of people in a compact space and people have continued to flock to them even during the recent period of heightened alert. It is not surprising, therefore, that Covid-19 cases have surfaced there, said experts. The increased number of cases recently might also be due to a variant of Covid-19 that spreads more easily, they added. The cluster at 115 Bukit Merah View Market and Hawker Centre is linked to 56 cases, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) on Thursday (June 17), making it the third-largest open cluster. Precautions have also been taken at other wet markets after positive cases were found. Stallholders at the nearby Redhill Market and Food Centre had to undergo mandatory Covid-19 tests earlier this week. Testing was also conducted for people working at the Telok Blangah Drive Food Centre and Market, which has been closed for disinfection till Friday. Associate Professor Alex Cook, vice-dean of research at the National University of Singapore\\'s (NUS) Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, said some wet markets may be quite compact relative to the number of visitors, which would heighten the risk of spread, even with natural ventilation. He said the recent wet market clusters have a mix of three types of cases: those who work in the market or at a stall, those who visit the market, and household contacts of a case connected to the market. The household contacts were not really infected because of the market per se, even though they are epidemiologically linked to the market clusters, he said. \"So the risk of infection within a wet market isn\\'t quite as high as it may appear from the size of these clusters,\" he added. Professor Paul Tambyah, president of the Asia-Pacific Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infection, said the spread in open-air wet markets suggests that airborne transmission is indeed rare as most authorities agree - for all strains of the virus. As for whether wet markets should be avoided, he said: \"The key has to be vaccination. That is how every single viral disease from smallpox to measles to polio has been controlled.\" A possible link has been established between the Bukit Merah and Telok Blangah markets. MOH said on Monday that a Singaporean man, 42, who works as a hawker at the Telok Blangah food centre is a family member of another Singaporean man, 47, who works as a cooking assistant at the Bukit Merah market. An infected person had also visited the Redhill Market and Food Centre from June 8 to 10, according to MOH data. Professor Teo Yik Ying, dean of the NUS\\' Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, said it is highly likely that the cases at the Bukit Merah and Redhill markets are linked, given their proximity to each other. He added that malls and supermarkets have been where outbreaks were detected recently. \"I do not see them as a new weak link, but rather as a consequence of Singapore having to deal with a much more infectious Delta variant that is driving these outbreaks.\" Recent evidence from Britain has suggested that the Delta variant has a reproductive number of five to eight, which is much higher than the wild-type variant that the world saw early last year, with an R0 of two to three, he said. The reproductive number, or R0, of a virus is a measure of its transmission, or the number of new infections generated by each case. An R0 rate of 1, for example, means on average each infected person will infect one other person they come in contact with. The MOH told The Straits Times earlier this month that as at the end of May, 550 Covid-19 cases in Singapore were infected with the Delta variant of the coronavirus first detected in India. The number included 428 local cases, and 122 imported ones. Prof Teo said the increased transmissibility of the Delta variant means there is a possibility of a large outbreak event happening whenever infected cases are moving about in the community. \"If these cases were going to work or going about their social activities, then I expect the venues that are associated with the large outbreaks will be linked to workplaces or public spaces for social activities. \"But precisely because the default continues to be working from home and social activities are kept to a minimum now, people are frequenting malls, supermarkets, and wet markets for necessities and food. This is why we are seeing outbreaks in such venues,\" he said. Residents in Telok Blangah and Bukit Merah have expressed concern about the growing number of cases in the neighbourhood, as well as people who do not comply with safety rules. Compliance officer Gideon Goh, 37, who lives in Bukit Merah, told The Straits Times that he hadseenelderly people smoking or talking in groups in his neighbourhood, with masks that are not properly worn. Mr Goh, who recently reported such behaviour via the OneService app, said: \"While we can report such non-compliant behaviour, if you want to avoid conflict, there\\'s not very much that you can do apart from avoiding these people.\" He added: \"I think it also takes a little bit more of a community effort. If there is a stronger sense of frowning upon certain behaviour by passers-by, then they know that they are in the minority and are more likely to follow the rules,\" he said.

       " {'text': '4 young men in singapore had heart inflammation after covid 19 jabs all have recovered Read 3 articles daily and stand to win ST rewards, including the ST News Tablet worth $398. Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - Four young men in Singapore had heart inflammation after receiving their second dose of Covid-19 vaccine. The men - aged 18 to 30 - have all recovered from myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart), saidthe country\\'s expert committee on the Covid-19 vaccination in a statement on Friday night (June 11). Most of the cases were reported to have occurred within a few days after the second jab. This is out of a total of six such cases reported bythe Health Sciences Authority (HSA). However, the benefits of getting a Covid-19 jab outweigh the risks, said the expert committee. As a precaution, the expert panel said vaccinated people, especially adolescents and younger men, should avoid strenuous physical activity for one week after their second dose. During this period, they should seek medical attention if they develop chest pain, shortness of breath or abnormal heartbeats, it said. \"Most cases are mild, recover without the need for significant intervention and do not suffer any long-term effects, although very rarely, severe cases may result in damage to the heart muscles,\" said the expert committee. \"Our assessment is that the benefits of receiving the mRNA Covid-19 vaccines - the reduction in Covid-19 infections and severe complications even if infected - continue to outweigh the risks of vaccination.\" The four cases reported by the HSAare aged between 18 and 30, and had their symptoms a few days after receiving the second dose of an mRNA-based vaccine. Both Covid-19 vaccines in Singapore - by Pfizer-BioNtech and Moderna - use such technology. All four men have recovered or have been discharged from hospital. Theexpert committee added that the four cases here are at \"the upper end of the expected range of this age group, based on background incidence rates\". \"While further studies and investigations are ongoing, the currently available data suggests that there may be a very small risk of myocarditis and pericarditis after the second dose of an mRNA vaccine, particularly in young men,\" it said. The expert committee also said that heart inflammation following the second dose of the vaccine has been observed in Israel and the United States in men below 25. The risk is estimated to be at 1.6 cases per 100,000 doses in the US. It added that there has been no increased risk associated with the first dose of the vaccine, and that the condition is generally more common in men than women. In May, it was reported that 20 cases of anaphylaxis - a severe life-threatening allergic reaction - had happened in Singapore in relation to the Covid-19 vaccine. In a separate update, the HSA said cases of myocarditis and pericarditis have been reported with Covid-19 vaccines both overseas and locally. Myocarditis and pericarditis have many causes and most are due to viral infections and immunological reactions, it said, and in most cases, the inflammation is mild. The authority has received six reports of myocarditis and pericarditis, of which four were in men younger than 30 years. \"HSA will continue to monitor this potential safety issue closely,\" it added.

SINGAPORE - Join The Straits Times\\' science correspondent Audrey Tan and a panel of Singapore\\'s top experts in a discussion on how to live with Covid-19 as the nation prepares for the virus to become endemic here. They will also touch on the latest science on the virus, especially with the rise of new variants. The panel comprises: - Dr Danny Soon, chief executive of the Consortium for Clinical Research and Innovation, Singapore (Cris). He is also a member of the Ministry of Health Expert Committee on Covid-19 Vaccination. - Professor Lisa Ng, executive director of the Agency for Science, Technology and Research\\'s (A*Star) Infectious Diseases Labs. - Professor Teo Yik Ying, dean of the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health at the National University of Singapore (NUS). They will discuss the implications of the announcements made on Monday (May 31) - plans were laid out for a new normal, where people can carry on with their lives while the virus is in their midst. Addressing the nation, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong sketched out a scenario where people will be able to go to work and meet their friends, take part in large-scale events such as concerts, and eventually even go around without masks outdoors. PM Lee outlined three key strategies in Singapore\\'s approach: fast, frequent and extensive Covid-19 testing, including the use of do-it-yourself kits that can soon be bought over the counter; faster and wider contact tracing to isolate close contacts more quickly;and an accelerated national vaccination programme that prioritises first-dose vaccinations. Living with endemic Covid-19 also means the country does not completely close its borders, PM Lee stressed. Singapore has to stay connected to the world, with effective safeguards and border restrictions to keep the community safe. \"We will not be able to prevent some infected persons from slipping through from time to time. But as long as our population is mostly vaccinated, we should be able to trace, isolate and treat the cases that pop up, and prevent a severe and disastrous outbreak,\" PM Lee said. The discussion is a special episode of The Big Story, a news talk show broadcast every weekday at 5.30pm on Facebook and YouTube. Topics covered in previous episodes include discussions on how workers were segregated into risk-based zones as Changi Airport tightened Covid-19 measures; PM Lee\\'s address to the nation on the extension of the circuit breaker; and Singapore\\'s $48 billion Resilience Budget to combat the impact of Covid-19.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - Applications for the Covid-19 Recovery Grant (Temporary) (CRG-T) will begin on Thursday (June 3) and end a month later on July 2. The grant, announced last Friday, is meant to assist lower- to middle-income workers who have been financially impacted by the latest Covid-19 restrictions. Eligible workers who have been placed on involuntary no-pay leave for at least a month from May 16 to June 30, or who have suffered an income loss of at least 50 per cent for at least a month over the same period, may apply for the CRG-T. Those eligible will receive a one-off payout of up to $700. CRG-T is a supplement to the existing Covid-19 Recovery Grant (CRG), which was launched on Jan 18 to support lower- to middle-income workers and self-employed people affected by the coronavirus pandemic, Finance Minister Lawrence Wong said at a press conference last Friday. In a statement on Monday, the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) said the eligibility criteria for the CRG-T are similar to those of the CRG, with two key differences. First, CRG-T applicants must have income loss of at least 50 per cent for one month or be placed on involuntary no-pay leave for at least a month between May 16 and June 30.This compares with an average income loss of at least 50 per cent or involuntary no-pay leave for at least three consecutive months for CRG applicants. Second, CRG-T applicants do not have to show proof of job search or training, unlike CRG applicants. MSF said individuals cannot receive both the CRG and CRG-T concurrently, as CRG-T is meant for those who are not receiving support in June 2021. Likewise, individuals who are currently receiving support from other Covid-19 support schemes, such as the Covid-19 Driver Relief Fund, are not eligible for the CRG-T. In a Facebook post on Monday, Minister for Social and Family Development Masagos Zulkifli said: “The CRG-T adds to a suite of assistance schemes that the Government has introduced since last year, to support Singaporeans through the pandemic. “After one’s CRG-T assistance ends, CRG-T recipients could still qualify for CRG support if they continue to require help and meet the eligibility criteria.” Applications for CRG remain open until Dec 31. Under CRG-T, employees who are placed on involuntary no-pay leave for at least one month will receive a one-off payout of up to $700. Employees who are facing salary loss of at least 50 per cent for at least one month and self-employed people facing net trade income loss of at least 50 per cent for at least one month - compared with their average monthly net trade income in 2019 or 2020 - will receiveup to $500. More details are available at this website. The CRG-T application portal will open at 9am on Thursday and close at 11.59pm on July 2.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - The Sinovac vaccine carries some risk of a person being infected despite taking the jabs, based on evidence from other countries, Singapore\\'s director of medical services Kenneth Mak said on Friday (June 18). For instance, there has been a recent report of healthcare workers in Indonesia still being infected even after receiving the Sinovac vaccine, and in other countries, the authorities are starting to think about booster vaccinations just six months out from an original vaccination, Associate Professor Mak added. \"So it does give the impression that the efficacy of different vaccines will vary quite significantly,\" he said. Prof Mak, speaking at a virtual Covid-19 multi-ministry task force press conference, noted that the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines Singapore is using are among those with the highest efficacy. It was previously reported that the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines have consistently shown to be highly efficacious, with an efficacy rate of around 90 per cent. The Sinovac vaccine has shown variable protection across multiple studies carried out internationally, with the most complete analysis showing a vaccine efficacy of 51 per cent. Prof Mak said Singapore\\'s Health Sciences Authority (HSA) has yet to approve Sinovac as there is still some critical data that the manufacturer has not provided to give the authorities the complete assurance about the quality and safety profile of the vaccine. He added: \"And because that data is still limited, HSA has not been able to make progress in converting Sinovac from simply a vaccine made available through the special access route into one that actually has that pandemic special access route (PSAR) approval.\" Demand for the Pfizer and Moderna jabs - the two HSA-approved vaccines in Singapore - is also high, with many people waiting to book their appointments. \"But we are releasing the booking slots based on supplies,\" Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said, assuring that there will be sufficient supplies for the whole population to receive full protection. \"The question is really one of timing... whether we can work with the suppliers to see whether some of those (vaccines) can come earlier. And then we are in a better position to be able to open,\" he added. Prof Mak said the two vaccines arrive in Singapore in batches on their own time, so supplies for each vaccine will vary at different times. He added: \"These vaccines are all HSA PSAR-approved. They\\'re fine for our use, and it\\'s okay to register for the Moderna vaccine... you don\\'t have to wait for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.\" Join ST\\'s Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - Swabbing is under way for about 180 staffat Enabling Village after a cleaner there tested positive for Covid-19. In a Facebook post on Wednesday (June 23), SG Enable said more than70 people at the community and social business hub in Redhill have gone for swabbing at testing stations nearby. SG Enable, a government-linked agency that seeks to empower people with disabilities, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) and Health Promotion Board areoffering free polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for about 100 peoplewith disabilities working in Enabling Village and around 80 otherswho work closely with them. It comes after deep cleaning on Tuesday of public spaces and one of the blocks at the hub, which is jointly managed by SG Enable and the Ministry of Social and Family Development. Those being tested include employees of food and beverage establishments and retail tenants in Enabling Village, as well as the Autism Resource Centre\\'s Employability and Employment Centre. SG Enable said it is \"especially concerned\" for peoplewith disabilities who work there, following the detection of a Covid-19 case in Enabling Village on Sunday. It added that they are a \"vulnerable group\" and the facility is near clusters in Bukit Merah View and Redhill Close. The patient -a 63-year-old cleaner - was among 13 community cases reported on Monday and is linked to a cluster at Block 119 Bukit Merah View. He was detected as part of community surveillance testing for residents in the Bukit Merah View area and is employed by CSP Maintenance. His serology test was negative, which suggests a recent infection. A serology test detects the presence of antibodies and can show if the person might have been infected in the past. In a statement on Wednesday night, MOH said another cleaner at Enabling Village employed by CSP Maintenance tested positive for Covid-19. The 50-year-old woman was identified as a close contact of the 63-year-old and had been quarantined on Monday. She is asymptomatic, and her test during quarantine came back positive for the virus on Wednesday. On the testing for peoplewith disabilities and staff, SG Enable added that it has \"heard positive feedback of care and accommodation\". This follows promises from MOH to improve Covid-19 testing procedures for peoplewith disabilities after caregivers called for the authorities to do more to help. This includes engaging relevant professionals as well as volunteers from the National Council of Social Service, who are trained to work with peoplewith special needs.

       " {'text': \"singapore and covid 19 adjusting to the new normal 0 Read 3 articles daily and stand to win ST rewards, including the ST News Tablet worth $398. Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. My fellow Singaporeans, for the last three weeks, we have been on heightened alert. We had discovered new clusters of Covid-19 infections. One cluster at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, and then another at Changi Airport. More cases soon followed. We also started seeing unlinked cases, implying community spread. So we had to step back from phase three. We went on heightened alert to reduce social interaction and new infections. Everyone has responded, to cooperate on the measures we had to take. Offices, malls, and the streets are all visibly quieter. Because of your support, the number of daily cases has come down. Barring another super-spreader or big cluster, we should be on track to bring this outbreak under control. We will know for sure in another week or so. Meanwhile, I count on everyone to keep up our efforts and stay vigilant. Please continue to stay home, work from home if possible, and go out only if you must. Most importantly, if you feel unwell, see a doctor immediately - even if you have been vaccinated. If our situation continues to improve, and the number of community cases falls further, we should be able to relax the restrictions after June 13. Compared to a year ago, when we had our first big outbreak, we are in a much better position today. We have built up our testing and contact tracing capabilities. Crucially, our vaccination programme is well advanced. With stronger defences in place, we have not had to impose a full circuit breaker. Unfortunately, we are also fighting new, more infectious variants of the Covid-19 virus. The B117 variant, which was first detected in the UK, has become widespread in the US and many other countries. We are now dealing with the B1617.2 variant, which was first detected in India and is now in over 50 countries. More variants will inevitably emerge, and we will have to deal with them too. What does a more infectious virus mean for our fight against Covid-19? It implies that we must continually adjust our strategies, and raise our game to keep Covid-19 under control. Specifically, there are three things that we have to do more of, and do faster: testing, contact tracing, and vaccination. Let me briefly explain. The multi-ministry taskforce (MTF) will provide details later on. First, we must test faster, and more liberally and extensively. This will enable us to detect Covid-19 cases more quickly. So that we can isolate them and ring-fence their contacts promptly, before the virus spreads further. Many different types of Covid-19 tests have become available, for example, antigen rapid tests (ARTs), saliva tests, breathalysers, wastewater surveillance, even sniffer dogs. We have been using some of these, and evaluating others, for some time. Each of these new tests is suited to different use cases. For example, ARTs produce results much faster than the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests that we have mostly relied on. ARTs are also cheaper and easier to administer. However, they are less sensitive than PCR tests. They may miss some cases that are actually Covid-19 positive. ARTs are therefore invaluable as a quick check. If you visit a GP or polyclinic now with an acute respiratory infection, you will be given an ART, in addition to a PCR test. Within 30 minutes, the ART will show whether you are likely to have Covid-19. If the result is positive, you can immediately be isolated and the PCR test will confirm your diagnosis later, which may take a day or two. That way we reduce your chances of infecting others, if you are already ill but don't realise it. Other tests are coming on stream. Breathalyser tests, which take just one minute, have been set up at the Causeway and the airport. They can be deployed to many other places too and soon you will be able to purchase DIY tests over the counter at pharmacies. They are simple to use, and not so uncomfortable. You can administer these on your own. If you are worried that you may have Covid-19 and want to put your mind at ease. Or if you are a front-line worker, and want to test yourself frequently or even daily. These alternatives to PCR tests help us detect and isolate persons quickly when they are most infectious. This will be a big help in slowing down the spread of Covid-19. As the virus mutates to become more transmissible, we must respond by testing more widely. We already do rostered routine testing (RRT) in a number of higher-risk settings: migrant worker dormitories, construction worksites, shipyards, air and sea ports, hospitals and nursing homes. With faster, cheaper tests, we can do routine testing at more workplaces, like offices, restaurants and shopping malls. We can also routinely test individuals whose occupations involve close contact with many people, and could result in superspreading events, like taxi drivers and bus captains, physiotherapists, masseurs, stage performers, sports and fitness instructors and educators; (they) could all be tested regularly. This will reassure their customers, patients and students, and enable them to work safely even with Covid-19 in circulation. In short, we are shifting our approach to testing. Henceforth we will not only test to identify infections when a new case pops up, we will also routinely and regularly test people who appear well, in normal work or social or community settings, to make them, and these places safe. Extensive testing will give us confidence to resume larger-scale events or gatherings. For example, we can deploy fast and easy tests before a religious service, a football game, a concert, or a wedding reception and participants can be assured that the event is Covid-19 safe. Therefore, you should expect routine, large-scale, fast and simple testing to be part of our new normal. Second, we will contact trace faster and more widely. Our contact tracing operations have vastly improved. The contact tracers are working faster and better because they have more experience and skills, and better tools. TraceTogether helps them identify and quarantine close contacts of an infected case within hours rather than days. With SafeEntry, they can identify thousands of people who had visited the same places as infected cases, and inform these potential contacts to come forward for a free Covid-19 test. This is what we did for White Sands, Jem and Westgate, and now NTUC Foodfare in Anchorvale. Because of Singaporeans' self-discipline, public spirit and support of TraceTogether and SafeEntry, we are contact tracing faster and more comprehensively. We can improve our contact tracing further by casting the net wider. Our experience has shown that if a close contact is infected, he is quite likely to infect others who stay with him in the same household. Therefore, in future, when we identify a close contact of an infected case, we will not only isolate him - the first-degree contact - and test him for Covid-19, we will also notify his household members to isolate themselves immediately, without waiting to see whether the first-degree contact tests positive. If later the first-degree contact tests negative, we can safely release his household members from isolation. But if later the first-degree contact tests positive, we will have saved precious time by isolating his household members earlier. This more aggressive approach will help us to shut down clusters more quickly, to lead to fewer cases. Third, we will vaccinate more people, and faster. We have made good progress since vaccinations started in December. Our healthcare and front-line workers, and the majority of those 45 and above, have already received at least their first dose. These are the ones more at risk from Covid-19. Now, vaccination of those aged 40 to 44 is under way. The MTF recently announced that we would speed up vaccinations in the next two months, and prioritise first dose vaccinations. This is in progress. We want to protect as many Singaporeans as possible, and as soon as we can, especially with the new Covid-19 variants. This approach will quickly provide the maximum number of people with good protection, instead of a good number of people with maximum protection. We are vaccinating as many people as our supplies allow. Our 40 vaccination centres islandwide are running smoothly. The constraint is vaccine supply. This is why we have been working very hard to confirm and speed up deliveries of vaccines from our suppliers. I am happy to report that since the last update by the MTF, we have received further confirmation of faster vaccine deliveries over the next two months. With the latest supply schedule, we can further boost our vaccination programme. We can offer the vaccine to everyone, even sooner than we expected. The next group to be vaccinated will be students. In this latest outbreak, we have seen more cases of children getting infected, in schools and tuition centres. The children were not seriously ill, but parents are naturally worried. Therefore, we will take full advantage of the June holidays to vaccinate students. Bookings will open tomorrow. We will give priority to the graduating cohorts for O, N, and A levels, as well as special needs students. Then the other students 12 years and above will take their turn, including students in our institutions of higher learning. After the students, we will vaccinate the final remaining group, young adults 39 years and younger. This should start around mid-June. This group is quite large. Therefore, we will give the Singaporeans among them a two-week priority window to book your appointments first, before we open up to the rest who want to be vaccinated. Finally, I want to make a special pitch to our elderly. Your response has been excellent. Nearly three quarters (73 per cent) of our elderly - 760,000 senior citizens aged 60 and above - have had at least one jab or booked a slot already. But 280,000 of you have still not yet booked appointments. Please come forward to get jabbed as soon as possible. Most people of your age have already been vaccinated, including many of your friends and neighbours. The President and I have been vaccinated too, and so have all my Cabinet colleagues. The vaccines are safe, and they will keep you safe. We will make the process even more convenient for you. If you are above 60, you can now walk into any vaccination centre, and get vaccinated on the spot. No need to register, no need to book in advance, just turn up at a vaccination centre, and you will be jabbed. If you are not mobile, or are unable to make your way to the vaccination centre, contact the Silver Generation Office, a doctor and nurse will visit you at your home to give you the vaccination. For those with elderly parents or relatives, please encourage and persuade your old folks to get vaccinated. Today, nearly four in 10 residents have had at least one dose of the vaccine. Our next target is to get two-thirds of residents vaccinated with at least the first dose. With our accelerated vaccination programme, we should be able to do this by early July, provided supplies come in as planned. And everyone who is eligible for a vaccination and wants one should be able to get at least their first jab by National Day. Whether you are old or young, please come forward to be vaccinated once it is your turn. With the more infectious virus strains, we need as many people as possible to be vaccinated, in order to reach herd immunity, or get close to it. This is the way to make everyone safe and resume more normal activities. Even as we tackle our Covid-19 situation, the pandemic rages on around us. Many countries are still not able to bring it under control, fully, much less eliminate it. India has suffered a huge surge of new cases, although their numbers are now coming down. In South-east Asia, many countries have not started vaccinations in a big way, and may see more spikes in the next few months. Malaysian cases have been rising, and they are just entering a nationwide full lockdown. Even places that have kept Covid-19 well under control, like Taiwan, Australia and Vietnam, have recently experienced outbreaks. One day, this global pandemic will subside but I do not expect Covid-19 to disappear. It will remain with humankind, and become endemic. The virus will continue to circulate in pockets of the global population for years to come. This also means we will see small outbreaks of the disease from time to time in Singapore as well. In this new normal, we will have to learn to carry on with our lives even with the virus in our midst. Our aim must be to keep the community as a whole safe, while accepting that some people may get infected every now and then. Just as we do with the common flu or dengue fever, which we now manage through public health measures and personal precautions. And in the case of the flu, with regular vaccinations too. Covid-19 vaccinations will not entirely prevent you from getting Covid-19 but vaccination makes this much less likely. And if you do get sick, despite being vaccinated, you are also much less likely to become very ill. Living with endemic Covid-19 also means we do not completely close our borders. We need food, essential supplies, workers, business and other travellers to keep on flowing. We must stay connected to the world, with effective safeguards and border restrictions to keep ourselves safe. We will not be able to prevent some infected persons from slipping through from time to time. But as long as our population is mostly vaccinated, we should be able to trace, isolate, and treat the cases that pop up, and prevent a severe and disastrous outbreak. Singapore's priority is to get through this pandemic and position ourselves strongly for the future, even as the virus continues to rage around us. If we stay united and continue to work together, we will be able to progressively open up, and achieve our aim. In the new normal, Covid-19 will not dominate our lives. Our people will be mostly vaccinated, and possibly taking booster shots every year. We will get tested often, but it will be fast and easy. We will go to work or school, meet friends and family, participate in religious services, and enjoy entertainment and sports events. We will reopen our borders safely. Visitors will again come to Singapore. Singaporeans will travel again to countries where the disease is well under control, especially if we have been vaccinated. And eventually, we will even go about without masks again, at least outdoors. Right now, we are some ways off from this happy state, but we are heading in the right direction. In this new normal, the countries which are united, disciplined, and put in place sensible safeguards will be able to reopen their economies, reconnect to the rest of the world, grow and prosper. Singapore will be among these countries. More confident and resilient than before, and toughened by what we have overcome together, and experience together as one nation. I have outlined our strategy for the next phase of the fight against Covid-19. To keep our people safe, while reopening progressively. We have to test, we have to trace, we have to vaccinate and we have to do all three of these more quickly, and more extensively. The heightened alert has two more weeks to go. I thank Singaporeans for your forbearance, cooperation and support. Each individual effort counts. Our collective discipline and social responsibility have served us well, and taken us thus far. Let us go the distance together as one people, so that we can look forward to a new normal, and emerge as a stronger and more united Singapore. Thank you.

       " {'text': 'mass covid 19 testing begins at two hougang blocks one in yishun Read 3 articles daily and stand to win ST rewards, including the ST News Tablet worth $398. Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - It is not possible for residents of one block of flats to catch Covid-19 from residents in a neighbouring block via the wastewater system, infectious disease experts said on Tuesday (June 1). On Monday, all residents of two Housing Board blocks in Hougang - 501 and 507 in Avenue 8 - were asked to go for mandatory tests after Covid-19 viral fragments were detected in wastewater samples collected from the blocks. The two blocks are within the same area as Block 506 Hougang Avenue 8, which saw its residents mass-tested for the virus after a few patients were found to be living there. The Ministry of Health (MOH) had identified 11 Covid-19 cases from at least four households in the block, including two that were picked up during the testing exercise. Professor Paul Tambyah, president of the Asia Pacific Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infection, said: “Detection of Covid-19 fragments in wastewater does not mean that was the mode of transmission – it is a screening tool to pick up the presence of individuals who are shedding the virus.” In response to queries, a PUB spokesman said that sanitary systems here are “closed systems” where the pipes are air- and watertight to ensure that no foul air, viruses or bacteria can travel between household or blocks. “For instance, water seals located in the U-shaped sections of underfloor pipes in the toilet bowl and floor traps for sinks, wash basins and showers act as barriers to prevent foul air that may contain bacteria and viruses from entering a unit’s premises,” the spokesman added. “These water seals are maintained by regular water flow from the sinks, wash basins, showers or flushing of the water cisterns.” He added that sanitary pipes are hydraulically and air-pressure tested by licensed plumbers to ensure no leakage in the system. “Backflow of used water will not occur in a properly designed system like Singapore’s, where the used water flows in pipes with proper gradient and is conveyed in a downward direction quickly through vertical down pipes,” he said. Professor Dale Fisher, an infectious disease expert at the National University of Singapore (NUS),said that the infected residents of Block 506 may have transmitted Covid-19 to their neighbours in Blocks 501 and 507 through other means, such as a contaminated surface. Professor Teo Yik Ying, dean of NUS’ Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, said: “It could be that there are people who are asymptomatically infected in these blocks, and we should not rule out the possibility of false detection as well. \"It is otherwise too early to speculate how the Covid-19 fragments could have been detected if there are truly no infected cases in these blocks.\" Rather than viral spread through the sewage system, Prof Tambyah said“it is far more likely that people living in adjacent blocks visited each other, and, hence, the wastewater surveillance picked up the positive cases in the adjacent blocks”. “Or, even more likely, there was a common source like a nearby coffeeshop that has yet to be identified,” he added. Testing for residents in the two blocks began on Tuesday and will end on Thursday. When The Straits Times arrived at Block 507 in Hougang at about 9am on Tuesday, testing operations were in full swing and residents had formed a queue to get swabbed. Madam Koh Beng Hup, who works in a McDonald\\'s outlet, said: \"I\\'m not worried about myself because I feel fine. But I\\'m worried that someone in the block might have the virus. \"I\\'ve always been a careful person. I wash my hands when leaving home or coming back.\" The 60-year-old added that the swabbing process took only about five minutes from start to finish. Mrs Sasikala Ramaiyan, who helps out at a minimart in Block 501, said she will be tested on Wednesday. \"Testing is just a precaution, there\\'s nothing wrong with that. We don\\'t know for sure, but we have to face whatever that comes. We cannot panic,\" said the 41-year-old. \"It\\'s good that they are testing everyone. We don\\'t have to guess whether this person or that person has the virus. Whoever tests positive will be isolated, and the Government can take the necessary precautions.\" Over at Block 745 Yishun Street 72, testing was also under way for its residents. MOH had announced the tests on Monday after six Covid-19 cases were detected in the block, with subsequent wastewater tests detecting virus fragments. Testing for the Yishun block will end on Wednesday. On Tuesday, Prof Teo and Prof Fisheralso shared their opinions on a message circulating that the earlier infections in Hougang\\'s Block 506 could have spread through the sewage system to residents living in the same \"stack\" - meaning they share the same unit number but are on different floors. Referring to the cases in Block 506, the message said: \"Suspect cause of transmission is the WC (water closet), when flushing WC air from other units get into the toilet and infect the guys.\" The message also urged recipients to put down their toilet covers before flushing. Prof Fisher said: \"The \\'column\\' of cases is in itself remarkable, but I would think contamination of an elevator or stairwell is more likely in seeing this pattern.\" Prof Teo said that transmissions through the sewage system between units in the same stack are unlikely, except in the case of leakages in the wastewater piping, or if a wastewater system had not been properly installed. Both said that closing toilet lids before flushing is a good practice, as toilet plumes from flushing can disperse aerosols containing waste materials. Separately, the National Environment Agency (NEA), which is in charge of wastewater testing for Covid-19, said that, as at May, it has expanded the wastewater surveillance programme to about 110 locations. This includes Singapore\\'s four water reclamation plants, workers\\' dormitories and other high-population density living premises such as nursing homes and student hostels. \"We continually assess the situation together with other agencies on wastewater surveillance points to complement clinical testing,\" said an NEA spokesman.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - More than 400,000 students will be invited to receive their Covid-19 jabs from Tuesday (June 1), with priority given to secondary and pre-university students in graduating cohorts, the Ministry of Education (MOE) announced on Monday. The roll-out of the vaccinationdrive for younger people here comes amid more cases of children getting infected in schools and tuition centres in the recent Covid-19 outbreak. A number of schoolchildren have tested positive for the virus over the past month, forcing some schools to switch to home-based learning before nationwide restrictions to curb the spread of Covid-19 in the community kicked in on May 16. Giving an update about Singapore\\'s Covid-19 situation in a televised address, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on Monday: \"The children were not seriously ill, but parents are naturally worried. Therefore, we will take advantage of the June holidays to vaccinate students.\" More children got the coronavirus this year than in 2020, with over 70in pre-schools, schools and institutes of higher learning who have tested positive since April 15. For a start, the exercise will start with about 56,000 students who will be sitting for the N, O, and A level, as well as other equivalent qualifications, such as the International Baccalaureate diploma, in the second half of this year. This is so that they can have greater flexibility in scheduling their vaccination appointments ahead of the upcoming national exams, the MOE said. Over the next two weeks, invitations for jabs will be progressively extended to other full-time students, including those in madrasahs, special education (Sped) schoolsand the international arms of Hwa Chong Institution, Anglo-Chinese School and StJoseph\\'s Institution. The earliest vaccine slots for students will be from Thursday, Education Minister Chan Chun Sing said at a virtual press conference on Monday. For most students, bookingswill be conducted via the National Appointment System for vaccinations. But students in ITE and Sped schools will receive instructions directly from their institutions. Students, or parents and guardians of childrenunder 18, will receive SMSes with a unique link for them to book vaccination appointments at any of the vaccination centres, so they have more flexibility to choose dates and venues in the month of June, the MOE said. Those aged 18 and above can opt for either the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine, while those aged between 12 and 17 willbe offered only the Pfizer jab as the Moderna jab has not been approved for use with the younger age group. But only those who are already 12 years old as at June 1 this year can receive the jab, while those whose 12th birthday falls after Tuesdaywill be invited for vaccination at a later date. To help parents who have questions and concerns about the vaccines, MOE will be partnering with the Ministry of Health to organise webinars for them, said Mr Chan. Parental consent is required for those below 18 to get their jabs, and parents or guardians will also have to accompany those below 13 to the vaccination appointments. Meanwhile, four dedicated MOE vaccination centres will be set up to support the vaccination roll-out for students. They include three centres at the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) College campuses in Ang Mo Kio, Choa Chu Kang and Simei, and one at the Raffles City Convention Centre. The ITE centres will be able to administer 1,600 doses of the vaccine a day, while the Raffles City centre can do 2,000 doses a day. The ITE will arrange for their students to take their shots on campus, while the Ministry of Health will send mobile vaccination teams to Sped schools to carry out vaccinations for their students who are age12 and above, as they may find it challenging to visit a vaccination site. Schools will also look into alternative vaccination arrangements for those who need extra support when schools reopen after the June holidays, including providing transport to the vaccination centres, MOE said. The entire vaccination exercise for students -which also includes full-time students in continuing education and training programmes, such as those enrolled in master’s programmes - is estimated to be completed by August. But those who do not make an appointment when offered may take longer to receive their vaccinations, MOE added.

SINGAPORE - The expert committee on Covid-19 vaccination continues to endorse the effectiveness of the mRNA-based Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines used in Singapore, it said on Monday (June 7). The committee said it is aware of messages that are being disseminated on social media that claim that mRNA-based vaccines are ineffective against new variants of concern, and that vaccines that use an inactivated virus would provide superior protection. The China-produced Sinovac shot is one example of a vaccine that uses inactivated viruses. \"Our assessment, based on a continual review of data and evidence, remains that the mRNA vaccines are safe and highly effective, and continue to show protection against the variants of concern,\" the committee said in a statement. \"The inactivated virus Covid-19 vaccines have variable protection and there is currently no evidence to suggest that inactivated virus vaccines demonstrate higher vaccine efficacy against variants of concern than the mRNA vaccines.\" Covid-19 variants of concern include those like the more infectious B16172 or \"delta\" variant that has played a role in the current outbreak in Singapore. The expert committee said the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines, which are currently the only two available under Singapore\\'s national vaccination programme, have consistently shown to be highly efficacious, with an efficacy rate of around 90 per cent. They are especially effective in protecting against severe Covid-19 disease and hospitalisation, the committee added. \"This was first demonstrated in the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials, and further supported with the data from actual roll-outs in the real-world, including in the United States, Britain and Israel,\" the committee said. \"This includes protection against key variants of concern, such as the alpha and beta variants, which were the predominant strains circulating in these countries.\" The committee further said that despite concerns over the delta variant, emerging data shows that the mRNA vaccines continue to be effective. It cited a study in Britain which demonstrated that two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine conferred about 88 per cent protection against symptomatic Covid-19, even with the delta variant. \"While further studies are required before a definitive conclusion can be made, the available data globally indicates that substantial protection is preserved.\" The committee noted that no vaccine provides 100 per cent protection, and with the emergence and spread of new variants due to mutations, infections can occur despite vaccination. But it stressed that the detection of asymptomatic to mild infections among patients with the delta variant does not indicate a lack of protection. This is in keeping with the global evidence that the mRNA vaccines have a high level of protection against symptomatic and severe disease, it added. The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines have also been approved by multiple reputable international regulatory bodies. The manufacturers have publicly released their detailed study protocols and openly published their findings to be scrutinised by the scientific community after peer review. Detailed assessments of these vaccines by regulatory bodies, such as the Food and Drug Administration in the United States and the British Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, have also been published. On the other hand, the committee said the Sinovac shot has yet to meet the requirements for authorisation by Singapore\\'s Health Sciences Authority, as additional safety and quality data required to meet the standards of the evaluation are still pending. \"The Sinovac vaccine has also shown variable protection across multiple studies carried out internationally,\" the committee said. \"The most complete analysis of the vaccine showed a vaccine efficacy of 51 per cent.\" It also said the protection Sinovac provides against newer variants, such as the delta variant, and under real-world conditions remains unknown. The Sinovac vaccine will soon be available in Singapore, unsubsidised, at private healthcare providers under the Special Access Route. It has been qualified by the World Health Organisation for emergency use in those aged 18 and above. But this means it is not an option for children and adolescents under 18 globally, nor in Singapore, the committee said in its statement. \"It is critical that medical professionals do not spread unsubstantiated and unscientific information,\" the committee added. \"The public has a right to expect medical professionals to give advice based on facts and not on unproven assertions. The public should rely on reputable sources of scientific and medical information, and verify opinions shared by others against these.\" In a separate Facebook post on Monday, Associate Professor David Lye,a senior infectious diseases specialist, also spoke up against misinformation being spread about Covid-19 vaccines by doctors, among others.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - Over 9,000 studentsbooked appointments to receive their Covid-19 jabs on Thursday (June 3) as the national vaccination drive for more than 400,000 students kicked off. Since Tuesday, students taking their N, O, and A-level examinations as well as those in polytechnics or their first year of junior college have been invited to take the vaccine. Announcing this on Thursday evening, Education Minister Chan Chun Sing said he was heartened by the positive response from students and the high sign-up rate. “As we battle the evolving challenges from the pandemic, vaccination remains the best way to keep our students and children safe,” said the minister in a Facebook post. When The Straits Times visited Bishan Community Club on Thursday, there was a steady stream of students and parents accompanying them to take the vaccine. Among the first in line was Anglo-Chinese Junior College student Ryan Oh, 17. Ryan, who is taking the A-level examinationthis year, said he was doing his part to protect his grandmother who lives with him. Even though most seniors have taken the vaccine, Ryan\\'s grandmother has not been granted approval from her doctor to do so, as she has severe allergies. \"The new coronavirus variants spread faster, and this new wave of Covid-19 seems more concerning than last year. I don\\'t want to risk passing it to her,\" he said. One parent, Ms Liza Ng, 46, signed her daughter Shyanne, 17, up for the jab even though she recognises that those who are vaccinated can still get Covid-19. The civil servant said: \"It\\'s one of the things I can do to protect my daughter. Even if she gets Covid-19, her symptoms will be less severe.\" She also chose to book an appointment on the first day of the vaccination roll-out to students, so that her daughter, a National Junior College student, can get adequate rest during the June holidays. \"Shyanne\\'s second jab in July is on a Friday afternoon, so if she has side effects, she can rest over the weekend. She\\'ll also have three to four weeks to rest before taking her prelims (preliminary exams) in August,\" she said. For now, only those aged 12 and above as at June 1can be vaccinated. The national effort aims to keep educational institutions and the community safe. Those aged between 12 and 17 can take only the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, while those aged 18 and above can opt for either the Pfizer or the Moderna jab. Priority is given to secondary and pre-university students in graduating cohorts who will be taking their examinations in the second half of the year. Students who received the Covid-19 jab at Bishan CC said they took the vaccine even though they had fears of side effects. Xin Yao Wei, 16, astudent at Hwa Chong International School, said: “But it’s worse to get Covid-19 than to experience side effects.” Cedar Girls’ Secondary School student Ra Hari, 16, said she hopes that Singapore can soon ease Covid-19 restrictions and open up its borders, with more people being vaccinated. Hari, who is SouthKorean and a student pass holder, has not seen her fatherin two years due to the ongoing pandemic.Her fatherlives in South Korea, while her mother is in Singapore. “We have the luxury and privilege of getting the vaccine first. I understand some students may want to wait and see, but I hope we can get the jabs quickly so that other Singaporeans can take the vaccine too,” she said. On Tuesday, the first day students were invited to book their Covid-19 vaccination slots, more than half of the 52,000 parents or students who received SMSes to sign up did so. Over the next two weeks, invitations for jabs will be extended to other full-time students, including those in madrasahs and special education (Sped) schools. Eligible students will continue to be notified through SMS until June 13, said Mr Chan. The entire vaccination exercise for students - whichincludes full-time students in continuing education and training programmes, such as those enrolled in master\\'s programmes - is estimated to be completed by August. Vaccinations are available at community clubs islandwide and will soon begin at four dedicated Ministry of Education vaccination centres from next Monday. Three of the centres are located at the Institute of Technical Education college campuses in Ang Mo Kio, Choa Chu Kang and Simei, and the fourth will be at Raffles City Convention Centre.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - Pregnant women and cancer patients on active treatment are among the sub-groups of individuals that can also be vaccinated, said the multi-ministry task force (MTF) in an update on Monday (May 31). The task forcenoted that more people have been vaccinated both globally and locally, providingmore evidence on the efficacy and safety of vaccine use. This is especially in relation to specific sub-groups where clinical trial data had not been as substantive. Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said: “We can now be more inclusive in administering vaccinations. Since the start of the vaccination exercise, a few sub-groups have not been included, mostly because of medical reasons.” But the Expert Committee on Covid-19 Vaccination has reviewed global and local data relating to these sub-groups and is satisfied that vaccination is safe and efficacious for many of them, he added. Pregnant women will be able to register and book a vaccination appointment from Fridayif they are part of the population group eligible for vaccination. But MTF added that they should discuss the risks and benefits with their doctors to make an informed decision on the vaccination. Singapore\\'s director of medical services, Associate ProfessorKenneth Mak, said this applies irrespective of a woman\\'s stage of pregnancy. If a woman becomes pregnant after getting her first dose, she can proceed with the second as well. \"There is currently no evidence to suggest that the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna Covid-19 vaccines may cause harm to pregnant women or their babies,\" MTF said. \"However, the committee recognises that the amount of data collected on this population segment is still much smaller compared to data on the general population.\" It added that it is also safe for women who are breastfeeding to be vaccinated and they do not have to suspend breastfeeding to receive the vaccine. Meanwhile, cancer patients on active treatment can also be vaccinated, MTF said. But they should do so in a hospital setting, after assessment by their treating specialists on their suitability. Active treatment includes chemotherapy, immunotherapy or radiation therapy that individuals have undergone in the past three months or plan to undergo in the next two months. Under the current guidelines, cancer patients on hormonal therapy can continue to be vaccinated at any available vaccination site. MTF said: \"Cancer patients on active cancer treatment remain a vulnerable population that is at an increased risk of complications from Covid-19. \"There is currently no evidence of any safety signals or increased rates of adverse events from mRNA-based Covid-19 vaccines for this group.\" The expert committee is also finalising guidelines on vaccination for cancer patients on treatment, including those who consult private specialists. Additionally, those with severe cutaneous adverse reactions, which arerare drug-induced disorders, can also receive the vaccine. Such reactions include the Stevens-Johnson Syndrome - a rare, seriousdisorderof the skin and mucous membranes;toxic epidermal necrolysis - a reaction where the skin blisters and peels, and can be life threatening;and severe hypersensitivity and rash. These people may go to the vaccination centres, if they are part of the population group that is eligible. MTF said the committee is also reviewing the safety data on peoplewith a history of anaphylaxis, which is a severe allergic reaction that can kill unless treated promptly, to allow more to be safely vaccinated. The review aims to be completed in the next two weeks and will set out guidelines. Mr Ong said: “Specifically, the committee is reviewing the restriction for those who are not allergic to the mRNA vaccine or its components, but to other substances like seafood, painkillers, antibiotics.” He added that the review will take about two weeks with the intention of removing these restrictions and allowing more individuals in this group to be eligible for vaccination. “This is quite a sizeable group of over 30,000 individuals. So the lifting of these restrictions will be a fairly meaningful one.” Read next: 6 key announcements from PM Lee Hsien Loong\\'s address on Covid-19 plans Join ST\\'s Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - KK Women\\'s and Children\\'s Hospital (KKH) has started inoculating pregnant patients against Covid-19, with the first six women getting their jabs on Tuesday (June 8). The move comes after the Health Ministry (MOH) announced that it would allow pregnant women to book vaccination appointments from June 4, following a review of real-world clinical data of vaccination in this group. The ministry added that women should discuss vaccination with their doctors, even though there is currently no evidence to suggest that either the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine could harm pregnant women or their babies. This is because the amount of data collected for this group \"is still much smaller compared to data on the general population\", it said. Associate Professor Tan Hak Koon, who chairs KKH\\'s obstetrics and gynaecology division, said women who are in at least their 13th week of pregnancy are eligible for vaccination. The jabs will be spaced at least two weeks apart from other vaccinations that they typically receive during pregnancy, such as the influenza and whooping cough jabs. They are being administered in hospital, rather than at vaccination centres in the community, so that obstetricians are on hand to advise the women about vaccination and monitor them after their jabs. Pregnant women who contract Covid-19 are more likely to develop severe symptoms, which may result in them being warded in the intensive care unit or put on oxygen therapy, Prof Tan added. Their babies also face an increased chance of being stillborn or born early, although the overall risks remain relatively low. For instance, one British study of more than 340,000 women found that 12 per cent of those who tested positive for Covid-19 when admitted to give birth had premature babies, compared with 5.8 per cent who were clear of the virus. One of those who was vaccinated at KKH on Tuesday was 28-year-old Suzanna Farid Tang Shu Ling, who is 26 weeks pregnant with her second child. The founder of ground-up initiative Urban Origins decided to do so after reading up about the increased risk of severe illness that infected pregnant women face, as well as the potential protection vaccination might confer on her unborn child. \"At the session, there were many doctors and nurses around,\" she said. \"At any point in time, if I had a question, I could just speak to one of them.\" Another expectant mother, childcare teacher Noriyah Abdul Rahman, said she chose to get vaccinated to protect herself and her unborn child. \"At first, I was frightened of what to expect after the vaccination - if I would have any immediate reaction,\" said the 43-year-old, who has a drug allergy. But the vaccination process went smoothly, she added. KKH is also looking to study whether antibodies produced by the mother after vaccination are transferred to the baby, a phenomenon that has been reported overseas. \"By right, the baby should have some passive protection from Covid-19,\" Prof Tan said. \"The question is: How much is transferred, whether this really gives protection, and for how long?\" Join ST\\'s Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.

       " {'text': 'firms should test staff for covid 19 regularly says enterprise singapore Read 3 articles daily and stand to win ST rewards, including the ST News Tablet worth $398. Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. Companies should test their staff regularly for Covid-19, especially if they work in riskier settings with a high density of people who are unmasked and in close proximity for prolonged periods, Enterprise Singapore (ESG) said yesterday. Companies whose employees are not on polymerase chain reaction rostered routine testing may wish to test them regularly using alternatives such as antigen rapid tests, said ESG. Its advisory comes about a week before phase two (heightened alert) restrictions are set to end on Sunday. The note also comes after Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong\\'s remarks last month that Singapore will ramp up Covid-19 testing, contact tracing and vaccination to curb the spread of the virus. ESG urged businesses to proactively manage potential contacts of Covid-19 cases at the workplace to prevent the formation of clusters. \"If an employee or visitor has tested positive for Covid-19, you should immediately ask any staff who were in close contact with the employee or visitor in the last 14 days (for example, working in the same zone or on the same shift) to self-isolate while the Ministry of Health performs contact tracing. \"This will minimise the risk of further spread if any of them are infected,\" said ESG. Companies should also test all high-risk employees if three or more Covid-19 cases are linked and formed at the workplace before resuming operations, it said. High-risk employees are close contacts of Covid-19 cases, and employees in roles with close or extended contact with customers. ESG recommended that high-risk employees of a company be placed on seven-day rostered routine testing after it reopens. The government agency also urged companies to adhere strictly to current safe management measures and update their workplace protocols to take into account the latest public health advisories. Employees and patrons should use masks with good filtration capability, including disposable surgical masks with a minimum bacterial filtration efficiency of 95 per cent, and reusable masks that are made of at least two layers of fabric. All large meetings or events at the workplace should also be avoided as far as possible and, if they must be held physically, must be capped at 50 people with a 1m distance between attendees. \"Food and drinks are also not allowed at work-related events. Employees should also not mingle with one another in social settings outside the workplace,\" said ESG. Companies should ventilate workplaces to maximise the intake of fresh air, and clean recirculated air by keeping ventilation systems in good working condition, it said. \"If necessary, consider purchasing portable air cleaners with high-efficiency air filters such as Hepa filters, which are effective at removing virus aerosols,\" it said, adding that companies can go to for technical recommendations on ventilation systems.

SINGAPORE - Two in three students in autonomous universities in Singapore have signed up for the Covid-19 vaccine since invitations went out on Tuesday (June 8), said Education Minister Chan Chun Sing. Overall, more than 50,000 students across all levels have got their first jab, he said in a Facebook post on Wednesday. He also said more than nine in 10 students from graduating cohorts have booked appointments to get vaccinated, while six in 10 have taken their first dose. Mr Chan added that four in five eligible students from Primary 6 to Secondary 3, and those in their first year of junior college as well as polytechnic students have registered. In his post, Mr Chan thanked Singaporeans for their support and understanding to allow children to book their appointments before the Health Ministry moves to vaccinate the rest of the population. Currently, the national vaccination drive has not opened to adults under 40. Singapore's most recent rash of Covid-19 cases saw many students at all levels coming down with the virus. In an earlier update on Monday, Mr Chan said almost nine in 10 students from graduating cohorts have signed up to be vaccinated, and half of them had received their first doses. Those aged 18 and older have been allowed to opt for either the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine, while those between 12 and 17 are offered only the Pfizer jab as the Moderna shot has not been approved for use for that age group. MOH gave the green light for those aged 12 to 15 to get the Pfizer vaccine earlier in May. Mr Chan's updates on the vaccination drive for students come on the heels of the Government's announcement in May that more than 400,000 students would be invited to receive their Covid-19 jabs from June 1, with priority given to secondary and pre-university students in graduating cohorts.

       " {'text': 'a future with covid 19 when does a virus become endemic Read 3 articles daily and stand to win ST rewards, including the ST News Tablet worth $398. Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - When Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on Monday (May 31) that Covid-19 would become endemic, it rounded off weeks of his Cabinet colleagues painting similar scenarios of a virus here to stay. Finance Minister Lawrence Wong, who co-chairs the multi-ministry task force tackling the pandemic, had suggested no fewer than three times in the past month that the coronavirus was \"never going to go away\". Education Minister Chan Chun Sing said in mid-May that Singapore must be prepared to live with Covid-19. And Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan said that Covid-19 would be \"permanent\" and that waves of infections would be a normal occurrence in coming years. Since at least late last year, public health experts the world over have warned of Covid-19 becoming endemic. Some tell Insight that with the pandemic still in full swing globally, it would be too soon to brand Covid-19 as endemic anywhere. Still, there are cues to be taken from the Sars and H1N1 outbreaks, as well as diseases now endemic here such as dengue and influenza. Professor Leo Yee Sin, executive director of the National Centre for Infectious Diseases, defines an endemic disease as one that has settled in a certain population in a geographical region, where the frequency or occurrence persists. An endemic is two rungs down from the current global situation of a pandemic, with Sars-CoV-2, the virus behind Covid-19, still spreading and affecting large swathes of people worldwide at an unprecedented scale and speed, she says. As at the start of this week, over 3.5 million people had died, out of more than 170 million confirmed cases since Covid-19 was first reported in December 2019. Between pandemic and endemic levels lies the epidemic, which refers to a sudden, unexpected jump in cases of a disease. Prof Leo says that if Singapore cannot completely eliminate Sars-CoV-2 from circulation and cases pop up in the community at a relatively stable frequency, a state of endemic would have been reached. But she does not deem it necessary to declare this at a definite time and adds: \"It is a continuous epidemiological monitoring of the disease frequency.\" Associate Professor Alex Cook at the National University of Singapore\\'s Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health agrees. Labelling Covid-19 endemic \"isn\\'t a big deal\", he says, since most epidemiologists already think that is the state the world will end up in. In a January survey by science journal Nature, almost 90 per cent of 100 specialists felt Covid-19 would continue to circulate in the global population for years to come. \"Even if some countries have been able to crush (Covid-19), like China or New Zealand, others gave up trying early on, so the horses have well and truly bolted,\" Prof Cook adds. Life in China has returned to near normal since mid-2020, though Beijing continues to quash sporadic outbreaks. New Zealand, often lauded for its Covid-19 response, last week had to temporarily suspend travel with Australia after a fresh outbreak in Victoria. Singapore, too, had to re-impose restrictions from May 16 to June 13 after a spike in local cases. The country has reported over 62,000 cases and 33 fatalities as at Tuesday. Prof Cook thinks it may be better instead to talk of a \"post-pandemic\" era - which PM Lee had predicted, in a March interview with BBC, would arrive in three to five years. \"At some point, the pandemic will have ended, but it\\'s very unlikely that will be because the virus has disappeared,\" says Prof Cook. \"Rather, enough people will have been infected or vaccinated such that the virus spreads slower and affects fewer people.\" Experts have suggested that 70 per cent to 90 per cent of the population should be vaccinated to achieve immunity. As at Monday, nearly 40 per cent of Singapore\\'s population had received at least one jab since the inoculation programme was rolled out in December last year. Professor Paul Tambyah, president of the Asia-Pacific Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infection, adds that a likely scenario leading up to endemic status is for the number of serious illnesses and hospitalisations to decline, prompting the World Health Organisation (WHO) to declare the pandemic over. The global body did the same in 2010 for H1N1. Prof Tambyah sees the virus slowing down its rate of mutation, to become less virulent though more transmissible. \"Stable equilibrium will be achieved with generally mild illness for most people and severe disease in the elderly and immunocompromised,\" he says. \"It could be argued that this has started to happen already for Covid-19.\" Still, Dr Oliver Morgan, director of the WHO\\'s department of health emergency information and risk assessment, cautions it would be premature to consider any change in Covid-19\\'s current status as a pandemic. \"The virus continues to evolve and we don\\'t fully know whether there\\'ll be a mutation that changes immunity to the circulating variants,\" he tells Insight, adding that large pools of global populations remain susceptible to infection. \"A lot of different things could happen… This dynamic state might take quite a long time to settle down into a less dynamic state.\" Prof Leo says: \"We do not know enough about this virus to accurately predict the trajectory.\" The virus has behaved in an elusive manner, she adds, and the multitude of variants and rapid immune evasion do not give comfort. When Covid-19 does settle, one popular view is that it will go the way of everyday illnesses that people have learnt to live with. Prof Leo cites how dengue is present all year round, with surges of cases - epidemics - now and then. It is likely the same will happen with an endemic Sars-CoV-2, she says. Other researchers believe it will follow the same path as seasonal influenza, or flu, which infects millions and kills about 650,000 people worldwide every year. In Singapore, the flu circulates year-round; most recent available figures indicate about 600 related deaths occur annually. Almost all modern flu strains are descendants of a 1918 virus which originated in birds and killed over 50 million people then - making it the deadliest pandemic to date. Like Sars-CoV-2, the flu virus mutates and there are several lineages, says Prof Cook. \"About once per generation, a very different strain of influenza emerges against which humanity has no (initial) immunity - as with Covid-19. \"The last example of that was H1N1 in 2009. That also spread like wildfire around the world.\" H1N1 produced over one billion cases and killed more than 280,000 globally. In Singapore, about 430,000 were infected and 21 deaths reported. Professor Laurent Renia from Nanyang Technological University\\'s Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine says it was discovered retrospectively that H1N1 was like a \"normal\" flu with most people having a mild disease, even though the virus was very transmissible. For an example of a virus that is no longer endemic, look no further than the original Sars strain and its outbreak from 2002 to 2004, says Prof Cook. It began in China, and infected 238 people and killed 33 people here, before being wiped out globally. Prof Renia says that with Sars, most infected people developed symptoms faster so isolating them from the moment of diagnosis helped prevent transmission. Infection control measures thus helped contain and eventually eradicate the virus, which left a global count of 8,000 infections and 774 deaths in its wake. \"With Sars, there were \\'only\\' thousands of cases, not too many to stop us getting the horses back in the stable,\" says Prof Cook. \"It does not look as if Sars-CoV-2 will go the way of its sister, alas.\" Prof Leo says: \"The virus has already altered our behaviour significantly and disrupted social norms. The question is: How do we sustain the altered behaviours and rejig the social norms, in order to reach a balance with the virus?\" Infections occur all year round, with peaks in the middle, end and beginning of the year. In 2009, an outbreak caused by the H1N1 strain was reported in Mexico. Singapore’s first case was a returning student from New York. The World Health Organisation declared it the first influenza pandemic of the 21st century. • It is transmitted mainly via respiratory droplets, and contact with nasal or throat secretions. • It is not the same as a common cold, which is characterised by a runny or stuffy nose. Flu has additional symptoms like fever, chills, headache, fatigue, muscle pain, cough and sore throat, and can lead to serious illnesses like pneumonia. • Routine, once-yearly vaccination is recommended for all aged six months and older. Despite sustained efforts to keep the mosquito population small, transmission occurs year round, with periodic outbreaks – typically during hotter months. Last year saw Singapore’s worst outbreak, with a record 35,315 people infected and 32 dead. • It is spread by infected female Aedes mosquitoes of the aegypti and albopictus species. • It causes nausea, vomiting, fatigue, aches, pain behind the eyes or in muscles and joints and, in more serious cases, bleeding in the gums, nose or internally. About one in five diagnosed ends up in hospital. But about 75 per cent of the infected do not show symptoms, enabling further spread. • Vaccination is not recommended for those without prior infection as it leads to a higher risk of severe dengue. A common childhood illness present all year round, with outbreaks in pre-schools. Adults can also catch it. An epidemic from September to October 2000 led to 3,790 cases, and pre-schools closed for a fortnight. Four died that year, and three in 2001. • It is spread by contact with nasal discharge, saliva, faeces and fluids from the blisters of an infected person. • Up to 80 per cent of infections are asymptomatic. Otherwise, fever, sore throat, rashes, blisters and mouth ulcers are common symptoms. • No vaccines are available. Good personal hygiene is key to controlling an outbreak. Up to 30 per cent of older age groups have latent TB. They do not have symptoms and are not infectious, but about 10 per cent of them may later develop active TB. In January, there were two separate clusters involving 18 people who visited Singapore Pools’ Bedok Betting Centre. • Highly contagious, it spreads through air droplets from coughs and sneezes – but only after prolonged exposure. It cannot be passed through objects or surfaces. • Active TB symptoms include a persistent cough for at least three weeks, low-grade fever, night sweats, fatigue, weight loss and chest pain. • BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guerin) vaccination at birth can prevent severe forms of childhood TB infection, but protection diminishes into the adult years. It can be treated with different drugs over six to nine months. New cases do not occur often but, in 2015, a hepatitis C outbreak at Singapore General Hospital affected 25 patients and an independent review committee linked it to seven of eight deaths. • A and E are transmitted by contaminated food and water, and B and C through blood and other body fluids. • Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver that can be fatal. B and C, together, are the most common cause of liver cirrhosis, cancer and related deaths. • Hepatitis B vaccination is routinely given to all newborns, healthcare personnel and other population groups at risk.

       " {'text': 'mcdonalds and pizza hut stress safety measures at outlets after covid 19 cases Read 3 articles daily and stand to win ST rewards, including the ST News Tablet worth $398. Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - The McDonald\\'s outlet at Canberra Plaza in Yishun is cheerfully decorated with pop colours and cartoon characters. But with dining in not allowed until June 13 under phase two (heightened alert) rules, it was largely empty and forlorn. A few young boys who came in were directed, after scanning in and sanitising their hands, to separate standalone order kiosks where customers can see the menu, put in their orders and make payment. The touchscreens are treated with Sdst, an antimicrobial self-disinfecting coating that is reapplied every 90 days. They are also sanitised every two hours. After collecting their food, the youngsters left through an exit at the other end of the outlet. These are among the measures and protocols imposed by the fast-food giant at all its outlets since April last year, when it suspended all restaurant operations for two weeks in response to a cluster of Covid-19 cases linked to its outlets. These are now once again under scrutiny with a new McDonald\\'s cluster that started with a delivery rider at its Bedok Reservoir branch on May 20and spread to a housemate who worked as a rider for the outlet at the Pasir Ris Elias Community Club. There are now 19 cases connected to the cluster. Eight are from the two McDonald\\'s outlets and six are delivery riders and kitchen staff of Pizza Hut, who are close contacts of the early cases. The remaining cases are other contacts linked to the staff of the two chains. McDonald\\'s engages a third party, i-vic Logistics, to supply it with McDelivery riders, while Pizza Hut has a mix of full-time employees and third-party riders. A spokesman for i-vic Logistics said its riders work only for McDonald\\'s. Both McDonald\\'s and Pizza Hut also work with food delivery platforms such as Grab, foodpanda and Deliveroo. Both restaurant chains say they have not added new protocols after the recent cases because strict measures have already been in place since the circuit breaker in the middle of last year. These include no cross-deployment of staff and delivery riders across outlets, temperature taking twice a day and constant hand sanitising. They also practise contactless deliveries and cashless payments. What the two companies have done instead is to remind staff and delivery riders more frequently to follow the protocols. This time, instead of shuttering all its outlets, McDonald\\'s decided to close only the affected restaurants for two weeks. \"The situation last year was different because staff at the time were deployed across outlets,\" said Mr Benjamin Boh, general manager of Hanbaobao, the Singapore licensee of McDonald\\'s. \"But we have tightened all our procedures since then and our staff and riders work for just one restaurant. So when anyone is affected, we can quickly close the outlet and contain it. It\\'s much more controllable.\" Right now, four restaurants, including those in Woodgrove and Hougang Avenue 8 that have cases not linked to the cluster, are closed and all the staff are quarantined for 14 days. Pizza Hut has the same policy and its three outlets connected to the cluster - at Punggol Plaza, Westgate and Havelock II - are closed. Mr Boh added that 30 per cent of McDonald\\'s employees have been vaccinated, and a spokesman for the company said all staff are encouraged to get their jabs. The i-vic Logistics spokesman said more than 80 per cent of its riders have been vaccinated and they have also been participating in swab tests for food deliverers. The major delivery platforms could not say how many of their riders have been vaccinated because they are not full-time employees. Mr Chua Teow Hock, director of operations for Pizza Hut Singapore, said the company is encouraging all eligible staff to get vaccinated as soon as possible. He added: \"We have submitted the details of our front-line and delivery staff to Ministry of Health for assistance to expedite the vaccination process.\" The Sunday Times visited a McDonald\\'s outlet on May 27 and a Pizza Hut outlet on May 28 to observe their safety protocols: In the kitchen: Kitchen staff follow a \"stay-in-position\" work system, with each person remaining in his spot, keeping a distance of 1m to 2m from one another. Cooked food from each station is left at a packing area and the packer does not enter the kitchen. Staff go on breaks one at a time. Staff and delivery rider: There is a separate packing area for deliveries, and the food is sealed after packing to reassure customers that it is not tampered with during the journey. Equipment used by riders is sanitised after each delivery. A bigger outlet like Canberra Plaza has a room called a delivery cell where two McDelivery riders are allowed in at a time to wait in demarcated areas for orders to be packed. For smaller outlets, the cell is outside the restaurant. Packed food is put on a counter and the riders collect it and leave. Riders from other platforms are alerted to food that is ready through a number display system and collect it from a separate counter. Staff and customers: Walk-in customers for takeawayuse a touchscreen to order and pay for the food. They then stand inside designated areas for the food to be ready before collecting it from a service counter. Those who want to pay cash collect the food from the cashier who stands behind a plastic shield. Hand sanitiser is provided on the counter. Delivery rider and customer: Cash payment is not accepted for deliveries. Contactless delivery is available, with the food hung on the gate or door. In the kitchen: The two kitchen employees work in separate areas and change their gloves every time they move to another station. Food that is ready is left on a counter and another staff member takes it to the packing area and bags it for collection. Staff go on breaks one at a time. Staff and deliverer: The outlet does not employ riders but use two \"walk-in delivery staff\" who take the food to addresses nearby on foot. Every staff member, including in-house deliverers, who enters the restaurant has to go through temperature checks, sanitise their hands and fill a digital form detailing health and recent movements. They must also wear approved masks, such as surgical masks and cloth ones with three layers. Riders from other delivery platforms are not allowed into the restaurant. They are alerted when the food is packed and collect it from tables set up at the entrance. Staff and customer: Customers ordering takeaway scan a QR Code for the menu, order and pay. They go off and return to collect the food from a table at the entrance when it is ready. Those who want to can order through the cashier and pay cash. A bottle of hand sanitiser is provided on the counter. Delivery staffand customer: For contactless delivery, the customer is alerted when the food arrives and is asked where the food should be placed. The deliverer keeps his distance to wait until the customer retrieves the food before leaving. Join ST\\'s Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.

       " {'text': 'cleaners in high risk sectors prioritised for vaccines amid growing number of cases Read 3 articles daily and stand to win ST rewards, including the ST News Tablet worth $398. Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - Cleaners deployed to higher-risk areas, such as airports, are being prioritised for Covid-19 vaccination, while other cleaners have been encouraged to get their shots, amid a growing number of infections among such workers. More training is also being considered to help keep them safe, the labour movement told The Straits Times (ST) on Friday (May 28). Said National Trades Union Congress assistant director-general Zainal Sapari: \"We are working with our union leaders and management to encourage more cleaners to go for their vaccination to protect them as they carry out their work as essential workers. \"We are also open to exploring how we can better protect our cleaners in high-risk areas by advocating for cleaners\\' training on how to don PPE (personal protective equipment) safely and properly so that we can minimise the risks of possible infections.\" Since May 5 - when an 88-year-old Ramky Cleantech Services employee became the first case detected in a large cluster at Changi Airport - about one in 12 community cases hasbeen cleaners. At least two of them were index cases, the first to be identified, of recent Covid-19 clusters. So far, 36 cleaners and cleaning supervisors have been infected. In one cluster, six cleaners working for the Hong Ye Group and three of their household contacts have tested positive for Covid-19. The index case is a 31-year-old who works at Changi Business Park. A spokesman for the cleaning company said it had reviewed operations to ensure workers were protected. Staff keep to their assigned areas at workplaces, and also have different meal and reporting times. Assigned stations are also disinfected daily and cleaned three to five times a day, while cleaning equipment is disinfected, washed and changed more frequently. Ramky Cleantech Services, with 16 employees found to have Covid-19 this month, did not respond to repeated queries from ST. There are about 58,000 cleaners in Singapore. Experts say that they are a vulnerable group and could be a critical weak link in the nation\\'s fight against Covid-19. Many are elderly, come into contact with surfaces that could be contaminated with the virus, and work in public spaces where they risk spreading the virus to others. Investigations by the Ministry of Health suggested that a 53-year-old cleaner working at Park Avenue Rochester, a stay-home notice dedicated facility, may have been the source of infection for a cluster at Westgate and Jem malls when she visited Westgate on May 6. The cluster now has 60 cases linked to it. Citing multiple studies, including one conducted by the National Centre for Infectious Diseases last year, Professor Paul Tambyah, president of the Asia-Pacific Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infection, said surfaces in toilets are more likely to be heavily contaminated with viruses. In addition, the viral load from people infected with the B1617 strain - which was first detected in India but has since infiltrated large clusters here - is much higher. So, a contaminated surface is likely to carry an even greater amount of the virus than before if an infected person sneezes, coughs on or touches it, said Professor Teo Yik Ying, dean of the National University of Singapore\\'s Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health. Chinese daily Lianhe Zaobao reported on Thursday that experts have not ruled out the possibility that infections among five male employees at Westgate could be a result of their sharing the same toilet. Mr Tony Chooi, president of the Environmental Management Association of Singapore, said the association is discussing tighter guidelines for cleaning procedures with the National Environment Agency. Currently, cleaning staff are required to wear basic PPE, which includes approved masks, gloves and aprons, in some instances. This will be adjusted so that those working in higher-risk premises have a higher level of protection. Prof Tambyah cautioned that wearing PPE in hot environments while cleaning is difficult. \"Making staff wear PPE for long periods of time could also make them uncomfortable and more prone to breaks in protection.\" Instead, he said, they should have access to all the protective equipment they need, especially good-quality gloves and disinfectants. To further reduce the risk of spread against Covid-19, it is also important that cleaners feel that they can report sick without financial penalty, he added. \"That would encourage the symptomatic to come forward and reduce transmission, as symptomatic individuals are far more likely to spark off infections,\" he explained. Other cleaning companies not involved in current clusters have already begun taking additional precautions in the light of recent Covid-19 cases in the industry. Mr Yap Shih Chia, senior vice-president of corporate development and strategy at Chye Thiam Maintenance, said that a significant portion of its staff work in the aviation sector, and 85 per cent to 90 per cent are already vaccinated. All staff work within their own project sites with no cross-deployment, to minimise interaction among them. Mr Chooi said cleaners, who take risks daily to ensure cleanliness, should not be vilified. \"They are the ones wiping down and sanitising high-touch areas several times a day, and cleaning up after us.\" Join ST\\'s Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.

       " {'text': 'askst can we pass covid 19 to our pets Read 3 articles daily and stand to win ST rewards, including the ST News Tablet worth $398. Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - There have been reports from numerous countries of animals, including pets, getting infected with Covid-19. Last week, an Asiatic lion at a zoo in India died from it. Its death prompted the testing of dozens of elephants at a forest reserve in the country. Tigers in India have also been tested. Russia reportedly started vaccinating pets at veterinary clinics with its Carnivak-Cov vaccine in late May. The Straits Times (ST) answers some common questions about animals and Covid-19. A: A small number of animals, including pet dogs, mink raccoon dogs and zoo animals such as tigers and lions have tested positive for Covid-19 after coming into contact with infected individuals. Two cases of human-to-cat Covid-19 transmission in the United Kingdom were reported in the journal Veterinary Research in late April, providing further evidence of such spread. \"One had mild illness and the other severe. The viral strains in both cats were very similar to human strains,\" said Professor Paul Tambyah from the NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine. Covid-19 infections in farmed mink have also been reported in at least 10 countries. Millions of the animals, which are valued for their fur, have been culled to prevent future spillover events to humans. A: There are very few reports of an animal passing Covid-19 back to humans, though there were reports of mink farmers in northern Europe infected by strains that moved from humans to mink and back to humans, said Prof Tambyah. The vast majority of the millions of Sars-CoV-2 infections have been human-to-human transmissions and it appears that animal-to-human transmission is extremely rare, he added. The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) said that animals do not play a significant role in the Covid-19 pandemic, which is being sustained through human-to-human transmission. A: Confirmed cases in cats and dogs are extremely rare and generally result in mild symptoms, said the World Small Animal Veterinary Association (WSAVA) in the United States. No dog or cat is known to have died from the infection to date, it said. People with suspected or confirmed Covid-19 infection should avoid contact with animals, including pets, livestock and wildlife, said the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). If you suspect your pet has Covid-19, you can contact the National Parks Board\\'s animal and veterinary services. It conducts biosurveillance and is able to do the right kind of polymerase chain reaction testing for Sars-CoV-2 in animals, said Prof Tambyah. A: No. Prof Tambyah said there are no licensed Covid-19 vaccines for animals here. The WSAVA said there have been no cases in which a dog or a cat has been proven to transmit the virus to people. There is no need for owners to consider vaccinating their pets against Sars-CoV-2 at this time, it said. \"As Sars-CoV-2 infection of dogs and cats most commonly originates from an infected human, the best way to protect a pet is to vaccinate the owners so that they are less likely to infect their pet,\" it said in a late April statement. In the US last year, veterinary pharmaceutical firm Zoetis started development activities for a vaccine, based on initial concerns about Sars-CoV-2 in domestic animals. \"If regulatory authorities determine there is a need, we are prepared to act quickly to further develop our Covid-19 vaccine for animals,\" Ms Christina Lood, its senior director of innovation and sustainability communications, told ST. A: The exact origins of Sars-CoV-2 are yet to be determined. It could be many years before we know for sure. The common belief so far is that Sars-CoV-2 likely originated from bats, a known reservoir of coronaviruses, and jumped to humans through an unknown intermediary animal host, like a pangolin. Still, a June 7 report by researchers from China West Normal University and Oxford University found that more than 47,000 live animals were sold at Wuhan wet markets from May 2017 to November 2019, but no pangolins or bats were traded. There are other hypotheses, including the politically charged theory that Sars-CoV-2 was leaked from a laboratory in China. The OIE estimates that at least 75 per cent of emerging infectious diseases affecting humans, including Ebola, HIV and influenza, have an animal origin. A: The four wildlife parks here already have strict protocols, such as quarantining new animals, to prevent cross transmission of diseases from humans to animals under their care and vice versa, said a Wildlife Reserves Singapore (WRS) spokesman. The Covid-19 outbreak led to more measures, including the need for staff to wash their hands with soap and water before interacting with an animal, as well as donning face masks and gloves when working with an animal. They also minimise or avoid direct contact unless required, especially with higher-risk species such as primates and carnivores. \"As added preventive measures, our great apes such as the orangutans and chimpanzees also undergo temperature checks twice a day,\" said the WRS spokesman. He said the risk of humans contracting Covid-19 from animals is very low. \"In addition, our veterinarians assess that due to the low number of community cases in Singapore, coupled with the extra precaution we have taken to care for our animals, the risk of our animals contracting Covid-19 is very low,\" he said. None of the zoo animals here has been infected with Covid-19. Join ST\\'s Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.

       " {'text': 'covid 19 more opting for pfizer vaccine despite longer wait than for moderna Read 3 articles daily and stand to win ST rewards, including the ST News Tablet worth $398. Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - Slots at vaccination centres offering the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine are being taken up more quickly than those for Moderna, after vaccination bookings were made available for those aged 12 to 39 on Friday (June 11). As people can opt for either of the two available vaccines here, some have preferred the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine because its side effects are said to be less severe, among other reasons. It is also the only one here approved for those under the age of 18. At the media conference by the multi-ministry task force tackling Covid-19 on Thursday (June 10), Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said those who choose to go to vaccination centres that offer the Moderna vaccine are much likelier to get an earlier slot, since students under 18 can take only the Pfizer-BioNTech jab. The vaccination drive for 400,000 students aged 12 and above began on June 3. Checks by The Straits Times on Friday afternoon showedthat the earliest slot available for the Moderna vaccine is June 12, compared with June 21 for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. All vaccination centres tagged \"more slots available\" on a Covid-19 vaccination appointment booking page seen by ST offer the Moderna vaccine. Ms Germaine Koh, 22, a student at Nanyang Technological University, chose the Pfizer jab after observing the side effects of those around her who had been vaccinated. She said: \"My parents took Moderna and they had slight fevers after taking the jab, but some others who took Pfizer said that they had little to no side effects.\" Some, such as university student Isabel Dyason, 22, chose vaccination centres that offer the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine even though they were farther away from home. Ms Dyason, who lives in Tampines, booked her first jab on June 25 at Bedok Community Centre. The shorter waiting period between doses for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine - 21 days against Moderna’s 28 days - also appeals to some, while others said they chose it because more vaccination centres are offering it. There were also those who thought the two vaccines are equally safe and effective, and chose their vaccination centres based on convenience. Ms Goy Shi Yi, 32, a communications manager, said: \"I wanted to get it done early and as soon as possible, because the situation may worsen very quickly as we\\'ve seen from all the recent clusters.\" She booked a slot for Saturday at Radin Mas Community Club, which is just a few bus stops from her home. \"I did read up on the differences between Moderna and Pfizer, but from what I see, they have similar efficacy levels and side effects. Side effects like fever aren\\'t of much concern to me. If we\\'re talking about rashes or some blood clots, then perhaps I\\'d be more worried,\" she added. A study, conducted by the United States Centres for Disease Control and Prevention and published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in April, found that those who received the Moderna vaccine more frequently reported side effects - such as redness over the injection site, muscle aches and fevers - than those who received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. After the second dose, 74.8 per cent of Moderna recipients reported reactions such as fever, headache and fatigue, compared with 64.2 per cent of those who received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. Associate Professor Hsu Li Yang of the National University of Singapore Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health said the reasons for the difference are still unknown. However, in terms of severe or life-threatening side effects, the two vaccines are similar and the risks are very low. \"In fact, the risk of anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction) to the Moderna vaccine is about half or less than half of the Pfizer vaccine,\" he added. Dr Ling Li Min, an infectious diseases expert from Rophi Clinic, said: \"Experts conclude that both vaccines are similar and equally good when it comes to efficacy, and that side effects depend more on the person than the shot itself.\" Join ST\\'s Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.

       " {'text': \"diy covid 19 test kits to be piloted at construction worksites Read 3 articles daily and stand to win ST rewards, including the ST News Tablet worth $398. Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - To further reduce the risk of Covid-19 transmission at worksites, the use of antigen rapid tests (ART) is beingpiloted at construction worksites for those who are not living in dormitories. These tests, which will generally be conducted once every three days, will be administered by workers through do-it-yourself Covid-19 test kits, the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) said on Monday (May 31). This comes on top of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) rostered routine testing that these workers continue to be required to take. Currently, all individuals at construction worksites, whether vaccinated or not, must be tested once every seven days or once every 14 days, depending on their risk level, such as whether they stay in dormitories. Under the pilot, which started on Saturday, unvaccinated workers will take an ART once every three days if they are on a 14-day RRT schedule. Those on a seven-day RRT will take an ART once a week. Vaccinated workers will take an ART once every week or two weeks, depending on their risk level. In a circular, the BCA said that each employer will appoint trained personnel as supervisors to ensure there are proper infection prevention controls and the correct use of the test kits. Some worksites will also designate and train specific personnel who administer the swabs for their colleagues, the BCA added. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced on Monday that DIY Covid-19 test kits will soon be available at pharmacies here. These tests, which are simple to use, can be administered by front-line workers on their own, if they wish to test themselves frequently or even daily, PM Lee said. PCR tests are the most accurate, but usually take a day or two for results to be known. The less accurate ART returns results in about 30 minutes and is used heavily for pre-event testing. The pilot use of such ARTs at worksites is being overseen by the BCA, the Ministry of Health(MOH) and the Ministry of Manpower (MOM). In its circular, the BCA said it is currently engaging worksites on the pilot initiative, and that more worksites will be progressively included as Singapore ramps up its supply of ARTs. More details on the requirements and implementation of the tests will be provided when they are ready, including the necessary training and preparation required, the BCA added. The MOH said on Monday that it will be extending the use of ARTs further, with pilots in student hostels in autonomous universities. It will also work with CapitaLand to run pilots at one or two selected malls for tenants and people who work there. Those whose rapid testreturnsapositive result will need to take a PCR test at a Swab and Send Home Public Health Preparedness Clinic or regional screening centre to confirm if they have Covid-19. They are required to self-isolate until they receive a negative PCR test result. Mr Eddy Lau, executive director of the Specialists Trade Alliance of Singapore, which represents specialist contractors and suppliers in building and construction, said that contractors support the move to pilot ARTs in the sector, as it will help to reduce the risk of the virus spreading at worksites and help to prevent a potential suspension of construction activity. “If there is a further lockdown, the consequences will be unbearable,” he said. At the same time, he said, contractors are also worried about the costs of conducting such tests regularly, as it is unclear if the Government will be supporting the costs of such DIY tests. “Workers also need to be trained adequately to administer the test to minimise the risk of errors,” added Mr Lau.

       " {'text': 'singapores tightened covid 19 measures working but not the time to relax lawrence Read 3 articles daily and stand to win ST rewards, including the ST News Tablet worth $398. Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - The current tightened community measures are working and bearing fruit, but it is not the time to relax or let our guard down, said Finance Minister Lawrence Wong on Monday (May 31). \"As much as there is a chance of us relaxing some of the measures after June 13 if things continue to improve, we must also be mentally prepared that we cannot rule out the possibility of further restrictions down the road if they become necessary,\" he said during a press conference. The co-chair of the multi-ministry task force on Covid-19 stressed that the situation remains highly fluid, with the task force\\'s assessments updated on a daily basis. \"If all goes to plan, there may be a chance... for some adjustment and relaxation of measures (on June 13). It\\'s very unlikely on June 13 that we will go all the way back to phase three, we will have to do this gradually and in a controlled manner,\" Mr Wong said. But Singapore may have to accept additional restrictions if there are new risks or clusters emerging, or there are more unlinked cases, he said. If all goes well, Singapore should be able to bring down community cases over time and break the transmission chain, but there are still unlinked cases popping up every day. \"Any one such case can easily be a superspreader and cause a major outbreak to happen,\"Mr Wong cautioned. In an update on the local virus situation, the task force said that the heightened measures under phase two(heightened alert), which are in place from May 16 to June 13, have considerably reduced social interactions and the risks of transmission while allowing most work and daily activities to carry on. These tightened measures have helped to slow down the chains of Covid-19 transmission and reduce the number of unlinked cases in the community over the last two weeks, as well as facilitated the swift detection, isolation and ring-fencing of transmission chains. Among measures which have been instituted for phase two(heightened alert) include the prohibition of dining in and limiting social gatherings to two people. Occupancy limits for malls and showrooms have also been reduced to 16 sq m per person. Health Minister Ong Ye Kung also said there are a few encouraging signs of how Singapore is handling the current wave of infections. About 70 per cent of all the linked new cases on Monday were due to household transmission, he pointed out. In addition, those who were infected through community transmissions have had \"quite mundane\" movement patterns which mostly involve going to and from home, work and food-related errands. \"Other than the Jem-Westgate cluster, there were no major transmission settings over the last 10 days,\" Mr Ong said, noting that Singapore is moving towards the right direction overall and is constantly improving its contact-tracing and quarantine protocols. \"But this wave of infection is not over, and we must continue to stay alert and vigilant in order to suppress it further,\" he added. The task force said it will continue to monitor the situation and provide updates on Singapore\\'s local situation and community measures whenthe need arises prior to June 13.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - The \"hidden\" Covid-19 cases that continue to circulate within the community remain a cause for concern, said Finance Minister Lawrence Wong on Thursday (June 3), adding that the recent coronavirus outbreak in a home for intellectually disabled adults is a \"stark reminder\" of this fact. \"We are dealing with a very infectious and highly contagious strain of the virus, which is capable of spreading much faster than anything we\\'ve had to deal with before and causing large clusters to break out easily,\" Mr Wong said in a video message on Facebook. \"So we really need to take the precautions and safeguards very seriously.\" He was giving an update after a closed-door multi-ministry task force meeting on Thursday morning. \"We\\'ve been monitoring the situation carefully and considering what are some of the next steps we might take,\" added Mr Wong, who co-chairs the task force. \"We are very concerned about the hidden or cryptic cases that are still out there in the community.\" The Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) said on Wednesday nightthat 27 people - 23 residents and four staff members at MINDSville @ Napiri Adult Disability Home in Hougang - had tested positive for Covid-19. None of the residents had left the home since May 7, except for medical appointments, while staff living in the home had been allowed to leave only for essential purposes. It is not yet clear how many staff members were living there. Of the 225 residents and staff, 91 per cent were vaccinated in February and March, MSF said. All have since been tested for the virus, with 23 of the 27 cases found to be asymptomatic. The home has since stopped the admission and discharge of residents, prohibited all visitors, and completed a thorough cleaning and disinfection of its premises. In his video message, Mr Wong reiterated his appeal toall Singaporeans to stay home as much as possible and see a doctor to get tested should they feel unwell. The Government will continue to ramp up testing and speed up its nationwide vaccination programme, he said, adding that people should get vaccinated as soon as they can. \"As our vaccination rates continue to rise, we will have greater confidence in reopening and resuming activities safely.\" Join ST\\'s Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - People who have recovered from Covid-19 and with more than six months since their infection will get priority for a single-dose of the vaccine. This is because they are likely to still have a strong immune response within the first six months of infection, the Ministry of Health said in a statement on Thursday (June 10). Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said on Thursday that experts have recommended that those who have recovered should receive a single dose of vaccine to further boost their immunity against Covid-19. Such recovered people will be able to register from today if they are part of a population group that is already eligible for vaccination. Singapore has recorded more than 62,200 Covid-19 cases as at Thursday, including more than 54,500 dormitory residents, and 34 have died from complications due to Covid-19 infection. Several studies have reportedly indicated that people who have had Covid-19 generate an extremely strong response to the first dose of an mRNA vaccine, with apparently little further boost from the second dose. A paper by the Cedars-Sinai hospital in Los Angeles in the United States published in April said that a single dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for individuals who previously had Covid-19 generates an immunologic response similar to that of individuals receiving two doses.

       " {'text': 'covid 19 travel vietnam singapore business leisure 15072318 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: Singapore and Vietnam are discussing ways they can prepare to\"gradually and safely\" resumebusiness travel and travel to \"selected tourist sites\", said Singapore\\'s Foreign Affairs Minister Vivian Balakrishnan on Wednesday (Jun 23). Dr Balakrishnan said this will \"hopefully\" be doneby the end of the year. The minister was wrapping up hisfour-day visitto Hanoi. It markedthe first visit to Vietnam by a Singapore minister since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. While both countries share a \"very similar\" tactical approach to COVID-19, the key difference lies in their vaccination progress, saidDr Balakrishnan. \"We are very fortunate in Singapore, because our vaccination programme is well underway, whereas (in Vietnam), they stillneed to sourcemore vaccines from overseas in order to roll out vaccinations,\" he said. \"But the key thing first is Vietnam needs some time to step up its vaccination programme so we will wait for them to be ready,\" he added. \"But in the meantime, we are working at the staff level to resolve things like mutual recognition of vaccine certificates, testing as well ... and tobuild up the level of confidence in each other\\'s systems. This is essential before we open up.\" As of Jun 21, Singapore has administered more than 5 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccines, according to the Ministry of Health\\'s website.More than 2.9million peoplehave received at least onedose of a vaccine. When asked if there were any benchmarks that have to be achieved before resuming leisure travel between the two countries, Dr Balakrishnan said no specific thresholds havebeen defined and that Vietnam is being \"very careful\" as theyneed to step up their vaccination programme. Both countries havediscussed a \"selective opening\" of some of Vietnam\\'s tourism sites, said Dr Balakrishnan. \"They are exploring whether to do perhaps a trial, opening one orsome of these sites, later on in this year and I\\'ve expressed our support,\" he added. \"I know many Singaporeans do want to resume travel, but please be patient, we want to open up (safely).\" In the meantime, both countries will work together onresolving issues surroundingvaccine certificates and testing results to build up the level of confidence in each other\\'s systems. This is essential before the countries open up and \"liberalise travel later on\", said Dr Balakrishnan. He added that Vietnamhas also expressed interest in some of Singapore\\'s technologies, such as the breathalyser test for quick, rapid identification of people who may have COVID-19. The minister said Singapore will help Vietnam to source these new technologies. The next few months will be crucial, as Singapore and other Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries step up their vaccination programmes, said Dr Balakrishnan. \"The key thing is to prepare for recovery. Get our systems interoperable, get our economies restructured, restart, reboot,get the jobs, and then look forward, to a much better year next year,\" he said. \"And at the same time, maintain global peace and build those relationships.\" During his visit, Dr Balakrishnan also met VietnamPresident Nguyen Xuan Phuc, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh, as well asHanoi Party Secretary Dinh Tien Dung and Chairman of the Communist Party of Vietnam Commission for External Relations Le Hoai Trung. In his meeting with Deputy Prime Minister Pham, both parties expressed their commitment to strengthen economic and financial cooperation under the Singapore-Vietnam Strategic Partnership, which will mark its 10thanniversary in 2023, said Singapore\\'s Foreign Affairs Ministry (MFA) in a statement. Singapore is currently one of Vietnam’s top foreign investors, with a cumulative investment of more thanUS$56 billion in more than 2,600 projects, addedthe MFA. Theyalso discussed regional developments, including ASEAN and the importance of deepening economic integration through the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). In his remarks during the High Level Opening of the Asia Europe Meeting (ASEM) High Level Policy Dialogue, Dr Balakrishnan emphasised that cooperation between Asia and Europe remains \"indispensable\"in the face of increasingly complex transboundary challenges such as climate change, cybersecurity, and COVID-19. He highlighted the importance of global governance, integrating economicsand maintaining free trade amid present challenges. He also underscored ASEM’s crucial role in supporting multilateralism and global governance in the wake of recovery from the pandemic.

       " {'text': 'novavax vaccine moths spike protein covid 19 non mrna 15088434 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: Singapore could be getting Novavax vaccines - a non-mRNA vaccine which has demonstrated high efficacy against the COVID-19virus - before the end of the year. Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said on Thursday (Jun 24) that Singapore authorities had signed an advance purchase agreement with Novavax in January this year. He said that the vaccine is still undergoing Phase 3 clinical trials, and Singapore is awaiting Novavax\\'s application for regulatory approval whileworking closely with them. Novavax has said that it is on track to file for emergency authorisation in the US and elsewhere in the third quarter of 2021. \"But we hope the vaccine supplies can arrive before the end of this year for those who want to take something that is non-mRNA,\" said Mr Ong at a COVID-19multi-ministry task force press conference where he announced that the country will be ramping up its vaccination programme. What is the Novavax vaccine and how is it different from other vaccines being used now? Here\\'s what we know so far: PROTEIN-BASED VACCINE Novavax callsits approach recombinant nanoparticle vaccine technology, it hasalso been called a protein sub-unit vaccine. The technology has been in use for two decades to make vaccines, including for whooping cough and shingles. According to a CNN report, Novavax clones amodifiedversion of the gene for the COVID-19 virus spike protein into a baculovirus that infects insects. Scientiststhen infectmoth cells with that virus, spurring them to produce the coronavirus spike protein.These virus-like nanoparticles are harvested to make the vaccine. Sinovac uses the whole, deactivatedvirus, whilevectorvaccines, like AstraZeneca, use anadenovirus to carrygenetic instructions for the human body to make the spike protein. mRNA vaccines like Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna use pieces of genetic material called messenger RNA to instructcells to make a piece of the coronavirus spike protein. All of them have the same purpose - to stimulate the body to produce an immune response to the virus without actually causing illness. The main difference between Novavax and the mRNA or vector vaccines is that itis made with lab-grown copies of the COVID-19 spike protein, whereas vector and mRNA vaccines include genetic instructions for the body to make its own spike protein. Novavaxrequires two doses given 21 days apart and the vaccine is stable at 2 to 8 deg Celsius, which are standardrefrigeratortemperatures. This means that it will be easier to store and transport for low and middle-income countries. HIGH EFFICACY The Novavax jab is about 90 per cent effective against COVID-19 across a variety of variants of the virus. In Phase 3 trials in the UK earlier this year, it was89.3 per centeffective at preventing COVID-19 and around 86 per centeffective at protecting against the Alpha variant from the UK. It was 95.6 per cent effective against the original COVID-19 strain. In a late-stage study in the United States and Mexico, itwas more than 93 per cent effective against the predominant virus variants of concern. It has shown far less efficacy against the Beta variant at about 55 per cent among HIV-negative people in a trial in South Africa. However, it is 100 per cent effective at preventing moderate and severe disease, similar to other approved vaccines. FEWER SIDE EFFECTS Novavax has said that the vaccine was generally well-tolerated among participants. Side effects included headache, fatigue and muscle pain and were generally mild. A small number of participants experienced side effects described as severe. Data showed that about 40 per cent of people who received Novavax reported fatigue after the second dose, as compared with 65 per cent for Moderna and more than 55 per cent for Pfizer, the Atlantic said. VACCINE PRODUCTION According to news reports, the vaccine has taken longer to complete trials and ramp up production because the US company has faced operational issues. It is small compared to the pharmaceutical giants that have had their vaccines approved so far. However, it has now got the funding and manufacturing partners to ramp up production. South Korea\\'s SK Bioscience was reportedto begin manufacturing Novavax COVID-19 vaccines in June and theSerum Institute of India is also supposed to make millions of doses of the Novavax shot, known there as Covovax,for the WHO-backed COVAX scheme.

       " {'text': 'alliances for action singapore together steady progress 15097430 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: Under the Singapore Together movement, 25 Alliances for Action have been announced over the past year. These are making “steady progress” in the country’s push to emerge stronger from COVID-19, the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY) said on Saturday (Jun 26). The alliances bring together people from the community, and private and public sectors to work together on solutions to social and economic issues. For example, nine industry-led Alliances for Action were convened by the Emerging Stronger Taskforce, which released its five key recommendationsto chart Singapore’s post-pandemic recovery in May. The recommendations have been accepted by the Future Economy Council and will be incorporated into the council’s work, said MCCY in a media release. The Beyond COVID-19 Taskforce, another Alliance for Action, also recently concluded its work and released its recommendations on how the social service sector can build resilience over the longer term. An Alliance for Action on lower-wage workers, formed in March, was midway through a series of co-creation workshops to mobilise the community to uplift the wages and well-being of lower-wage workers. The Singapore Together movement was announced by Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat in 2019 to involve Singaporeans in creating the country’s shared future together. On Saturday, Mr Heng said that COVID-19 has strengthened the movement’s sense of purpose and uncovered areas that need more urgent action. “Singaporeans wish for a more caring, just and equal society, and are prepared to play an active part in achieving it,” he said in remarks made on the second anniversary of Singapore Together. “The pandemic has convinced me that our people have the conviction and will to recover and build a brighter shared future post-COVID-19, and that this future is within our reach.” An Alliance for Action on online ordering for hawkers, for example, was launched last week to work on solutions to the challenges that hawkers face in going digital. Many food and beverage business have turned to online ordering and delivery amid dine-in restrictions to curb the spread of COVID-19. With work-from-home arrangements leading to increased blurring of work-life boundaries, an Alliance for Action on work-life harmony was also launched in February in response to discussions in the Emerging Singapore Conversations. “The Alliances for Action have made good progress, exploring and trying out solutions to complex issues, especially those that Singaporeans said matter most to them in our Emerging Stronger Conversations,” said Minister for National Development and Minister-in-charge of Social Integration Desmond Lee. MORE CONVERSATIONS The Alliances for Action and other partnerships address 15 major themes from the Emerging Stronger Conversations. Themes include social support, environment and jobs and the economy. Under the digitalisation and technology theme, for example, were the Alliances for Action on online ordering for hawkers, tackling online harms targeted at women and girls, enhancing digital readiness and enhancing digital access for the needy. Altogether, about 16,900 Singaporeans have exchanged their views in these conversations since the series was launched in June last year. There will also be more opportunities for participation and “deep dive” conversations to come, said MCCY. These will include Emerging Stronger Conversations on marriage and parenthood as well as Singapore’s Green Plan 2030. Feedback from more than 100 conversations on women’s development will also be consolidated into a White Paperthat will be tabled in Parliament, noted MCCY. Ms Indranee Rajah said that many Singaporeans have stepped forward with ground-up initiatives to help where needed. “I have met and spoken with several of them, and am inspired by their generosity and care. I commend all of them for embodying the spirit of Singapore Together,” said Ms Indranee, Minister in the Prime Minister’s Office and Second Minister for Finance andNational Development. Reflecting on the past two years of the Singapore Together movement, Mr Heng said one learning point was that Singaporeans’ aspirations for a more caring, just and equal society have found stronger expression during COVID-19. “With what we have learnt, we will further grow our Alliances for Action in the coming year, especially in the areas of creating new jobs and opportunities, reducing inequality, making further progress on Singapore’s women’s development and building a greener Singapore.” It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

Speaking at a COVID-19 multi ministry task force press conference, Mr Wong noted that there areplans to make several \"immediate moves\" over the next few weeks. \"First is the next stage of our reopening - specifically to move from two persons to five persons for higher-risk settings like F&B (food and beverage)dining-in. We had said earlier that we planned to do this sometime around mid-July. \"With the vaccine on track, with regular testing of workers in these higher-risk settingsproceeding, we should be able to get there,\" he said. \"Exactly what, when, this will be, we will work out the datesand we will give some advance noticebut this is something we should be able to proceed on.\" Singapore began to gradually reopen on Monday, with a number of restrictions easing, including the resumption of dining-in. However, this was only allowed in groups of up to two people, instead of up to five as previously planned. Dining-inhad not been allowedsince May 16 amid the rising number of COVID-19 communitycases. Mr Wong also noted that there are plans to revise the public health guidelines for those who are vaccinated. This wouldapplyin two aspects, he said. \"We could allow gatherings involving just vaccinated persons to have larger group sizesand also relax the social distancing rules in such settingsbecause only vaccinated persons are involved,\" Mr Wongsaid. \"So that\\'s within Singapore and this could apply to a whole range of different settings, religious services, concerts, sporting eventsand so on. So that\\'s one area of work that we are working on.\" There could also be changes to theoutbound travel restrictionsfor Singaporeans. \"Potentially we are working on some new guidelines for people in Singapore to be able to travel abroad. And then when you come back, you either can serve a shortened SHN (Stay-Home Notice),a quarantine time under theStay-HomeNotice wouldbe shorter, ormay be waived entirelyand replaced with some tests,and this will depend on the country that you visit,\" he said. \"These are the potentially revised guidelines that would apply to vaccinated persons. We are still working through themand we will announce them when we are ready.\" Ultimately, Mr Wong emphasised the need forvaccinations. This, he said, has been highlighted across the globe. \"At the end of the day, whether it is in Singapore or anywhere in the world, this is really a race between the virus and vaccination. And so, it is of utmost importance, as everyone on the panel has already said, for us to get our vaccination rates up,\" said Mr Wong.

In a press release on Friday (Jun 25) night, MOH said it was investigating multiple cases of COVID-19 infection among individuals who reside or work in the area, as well as visitors of the vicinity. Special testing operations and wastewater testing were also being conducted. \"As an added layer of ringfencing to help to identify cases and prevent further transmission, MOH is working with the People’s Association for residents of specific blocks within the region to collect ART kits,\" it said. Those eligible are \"strongly encouraged\" to collect these kits and perform self-testing, said MOH. Residents can collect the kits at their nearest Residents\\' Committee Centre on Jun 26 and Jun 27. Residents can refer to www.gowhere.gov.sg/art to see if their blocks are included in the collection drive and locate the nearest Residents\\' Committee Centre from which they can collect their test kits. Singapore reported 15 new COVID-19 cases in the community on Friday. Three of the community cases were linked to the 115 Bukit Merah View Market and Food Centre cluster, which currently has 87 cases linked to it. Six residents at 105 Henderson Cresent in Bukit Merah have also tested positive, forming a new cluster on Friday. On Thursday,Associate Professor Kenneth Mak, the Health Ministry’s director of medical services said more than half of the cases linked to the cluster at115 Bukit Merah View Market and Hawker Centre had not been vaccinated. He added thatthe clusters in the Bukit Merah and Tiong Bahru area were of concern to the authorities, and that they would continue to monitor them. COMMUNITY TESTING AT ENG WATT STREET In a separate press release on Friday, MOH said 13 cases had been detected so far in its investigation into likely COVID-19 transmission at Eng Watt Street. The 13 cases were in three households at 66 Eng Watt Street. Epidemiological investigations were ongoing to determine links and source of transmission. To disrupt any wider, undetected transmission, MOH said it will conduct mandatory testing for all residents of 66 Eng Watt Street. Testing will be conducted at the pavilion at 2D Boon Tiong Road between 9am and 4pm on Jun 26 and Jun 27. Testing is optional for those who tested negative for COVID-19 from Jun 22 onwards. Those who test positive will be isolated, and close contacts will be identified, tested and quarantined. MOH said it will also conduct voluntary testing for visitors and those who interacted with residents of 66 Eng Watt Street between Jun 8 and Jun 22, and encouraged those affected to come forward. Testing for these individuals will be conducted by appointment at designated Regional Screening Centres between 9am and 4pm on Jun 26 and Jun 27.

This is part of its Stay Prepared initiative to “help everyone stay safe, especially with the emergence of new and more infectious COVID-19 variants”. Regular use of an oximeter can help alert people to seek medical attention when their blood oxygen levels become dangerously low, it added. \"\\'Silent pneumonia\\'is one of the most serious consequences of COVID-19, where seriously ill people can feel generally well, despite damaged lungs and dangerously low levels of oxygen,” Temasek Foundation said. Singapore Post will also distribute a leaflet with a redemption tab to each household letterbox between Jun 28 and Jul 3. Residents can take the leaflet to collect the oximeter between Jul 5 and Aug 5 at more than 300 participating supermarket and pharmacy outlets across the island. Information on the collection points and operating hours are available at www.stayprepared.sg/oximeter. They can also collect on behalf of other family households or their friends and neighbours by bringing along their household leaflets with the redemption tabs. “There is plenty of stock, so there is no need to rush,” saidTemasek Foundation, adding that residents may opt to collect after Jul 7 or during off-peak hours to avoid crowds. In case of a defective or faulty oximeter, residents may exchange their unit at the Temasek Shophouse at 28 Orchard Road. They may do so between Jul 5 and Aug 31, during operating hours. However, free oximeters cannot be collected at the premises.Residents must bring the oximeter and its box in its original condition, along with Government-issued identification such as their NRIC or FIN card for identification purposes. This is the latest initiative from the Temasek Foundation amid the COVID-19 pandemic, following the distribution of free hand sanitisers and face masks to Singapore households.

       " {'text': 'covid 19 delta variant virus vaccine moh 15041706 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: On May 31, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong signalled that a new, dangerous front had opened up in Singapore\\'s battle against COVID-19. It was not about the tightening or easing of restrictions, but a shift instrategy to contain a changing enemy. “Unfortunately, we are also fighting new, more infectious variants of the COVID-19 virus,” he said. “What does a more infectious virus mean for our fight against COVID-19? It implies that we must continually adjust our strategies and raise our game to keep COVID-19 under control.” Singapore, Mr Lee said, needed to do more of three things, and faster: Testing, contact tracing and vaccination against COVID-19. On Friday (Jun 18), Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said Singapore has raised its contact tracing, testing and quarantine capabilities as well as vaccinated a \"good part\" of its population. “So I believe we are now able to put ‘circuit breaker’ behind us and keep most businesses open while navigating a wave of transmissions, as we have just done over the past few weeks,” he said. But even as he signalled progress was being made, Mr Ong also sounded a cautionary note:“However, with the Delta variant, we still need to be very careful of high-risk settings, meaning enclosed, mask off, and lots of interaction, namely in F&B (places) and gyms.” It is easy to see why the variants have created a new dynamic for the authorities to deal with. The Ministry of Health (MOH) told CNA on Friday that as of the end of May, it has detected 428 local COVID-19 cases with the more infectious B16172 variant –recently dubbed the Delta variant –of the coronavirus first detected in India. The Delta variant has also been identified in 122 imported cases, MOH said. The B1617 variant has been called a triple mutant variant since it is split into three lineages, including B16171 (Kappa) and B16172. While MOH did not say when the first Delta variant case was confirmed in Singapore and which case this was, figures from the global epidemic tracker GISAID show that the first Delta case was detected here on Apr 1. The GISAID data did not indicateif this first case was local or imported. From Apr 1 to May 31, MOHannounced in its daily updates a total of 574 new community infections. MOH figures also showed that as of May 31, nine local cases have the B1351 (Beta) variant first detected in South Africa, seven local cases have the B117 (Alpha) variant first detected in Britain, and five local cases have the B11281/P1 (Gamma) variant first detected in Brazil. The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified these strains as “variants of concern” as they are more transmissible, virulent, or resistant to public health measures or treatments. MOH also said early in May that three local cases have the Kappa variant. The Kappa variant is a “variant of interest” under WHO’s classification, meaning it has caused community transmission and clusters, or has been detected in multiple countries. MOH said the National Public Health Laboratory conducts viral genomic sequencing on all COVID-19 cases in Singapore to detect variants. “Sequencing and analysis takes about seven days on average but it may take longer, particularly if there is a lower viral load in the swab specimens,” a spokesperson said.“Due to the time taken to carry out this process, variant cases will be reported as confirmed cases, but not necessarily as variant cases, in our daily press releases.” The spokesperson said sequencing is an ongoing process carried out concurrently with “prompt public health action”. “The National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) reports regularly to GISAID as and when the analysis is completed,” the spokesperson added. CHANGI AIRPORT CLUSTER The B1617 variant’s relentless spread was highlighted in the Changi Airport cluster, which ballooned to more than 100 cases in less than a month to become Singapore’s largest active COVID-19 cluster. The cluster was closed on Friday after going through two incubation periods without any new cases. The cluster’s index case, Case 62873, is an 88-year-old cleaner who worked at Changi Airport Terminal 3. He tested positive on May 5 despite being fully vaccinated. While it remains unclear how exactly the variant reached Singapore, spread so quickly and infected other members of the public, there were some early clues. Mr Ong Ye Kung said on May 14 that several cases linked to the airport cluster had tested preliminarily positive for the B1617 variant. The infected airport workers mainly received travellers from high-risk countries in the immigration and baggage claim areas, he said.These workers would then go on to have their meals at the Terminal 3 Basement 2 commercial area and food court, where they likely passed the virus to the community, he added. Initial transmission could have occurred through an airport worker who had helped a family from South Asia, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore and Changi Airport Group (CAG) said on May 21. The family later tested positive for the virus. On May 24, CAG chief executive officer Lee Seow Hiang confirmed that the B1617 variant was part of what caused the cluster. While the CEO said the airport had implemented “many layers of stringent safety protocols”, he acknowledged that “something changed” with the B1617 variant. “It penetrated our defences and caused a community outbreak,” he conceded. The Changi Airport cluster had108 cases as of Friday, with the most recent cases reported on May 23. OTHER NOTABLE CLUSTERS Another large cluster linked to the B1617 variant was the one that spread in Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH). This remains Singapore’s only COVID-19 cluster in a hospital. The cluster is now closed. A fully vaccinated 46-year-old female nurse at TTSH, or case 62541, became the first case linked to the cluster after she tested positive on Apr 27. By May 4, just a week after the first case was discovered, the cluster had swelled to 40 cases, MOH figures showed. On the same day, MOH’s director of medical services Kenneth Mak confirmed that the nurse, along with four others in the cluster, were infected with the Delta variant. Authorities are still investigating the source of the cluster. Until now, variant cases continue to emerge alongside new clusters. MOH confirmed on Wednesday that one case in the new Bukit Merah View market cluster had tested preliminarily positive for the Delta variant.The cluster was first identified three days earlier on Jun 13 with four cases linked to the food centre there. The cluster had 65cases as of Friday. Assistant Professor Hannah Clapham, who researches infectious diseases at the National University of Singapore’s (NUS) Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, said it was important to study the clusters to learn about the Delta variant’s transmission rate, where and how it was spreading, and the effectiveness of the measures against it. “It would seem that the higher transmissibility of the B16172 variant did mean that it was able to evade the measures that were in place in Singapore,” she said. “It could also be that as this variant was spreading globally, we saw more introductions of B16172 into Singapore and therefore this is the variant that spread.” Other countries are also dealing with the new challenges presented by the more infectious variant. According to GISAID, the UK hadreported 46,890 Delta cases as of Friday, the highest number of confirmed cases in the world ahead of India(6,684 cases) and the US (2,853 cases). The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Tuesday recognised the Delta variant as a “variant of concern”, with top infectious diseases expert Dr Anthony Fauci encouraging everyone to get vaccinated, CNN reported.Dr Fauci pointed out that the Delta variant was in circulation in the United States at a rate similar to the tipping point seen in the UK, where the variant has become dominant. The UK had announced on Monday that it would delay the easing of COVID-19 restrictions by another four weeks, until Jul 19, following a rise in cases and the growing spread of the Delta variant. HOW MUCH MORE INFECTIOUS? Beyond the fast rate of infection, it is worth understanding how variants form and how a particular strain gains dominance over the rest. There are thousands of different coronavirus variants circulating worldwide. Viruses mutate all the time when replicating and most changes make no difference. Some even harm the virus. But others can make the virus more infectious and the disease more threatening – and these strains tend to dominate. “The few mutations that give a virus an advantage, such as being able to bind to the host cell better, tend to (allow the variant to) survive and eventually replace the other strains of the virus,”Dr Paul Tambyah, president of the Asia Pacific Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infection, told CNA. So, while experts CNA spoke to agreed that the Delta variant is more infectious, how much more infectious exactly is it? “PCR tests indicate that the amount of virus in the (Delta) samples is often higher than what we see before,” said Professor Leo Yee Sin, executive director at the NCID. “This could be 100- to 1000-fold higher than expected, reflecting the millions of virus particles present in each specimen. This high viral load in the respiratory tract may imply higher transmission ability resulting in a large number of cases and at faster speed.” Citing research coming out of the UK, Dr Tambyah said the Delta strain was associated with secondary infections in 13.5 per cent of cases with local transmission. This is in contrast to 11 per cent for the Gamma variant and 8.1 per cent for the Alpha variant. AIRBORNE TRANSMISSION OF VARIANTS Another worry is the potential airborne transmission of variants. While it has been established that COVID-19 infection primarily occurs through exposure to respiratory fluids carrying the virus, the science increasingly shows that the virus could also be spread by tiny particles suspended in the air. COVID-19 multi-ministry task force co-chair Lawrence Wong alluded to this on May 18 when recommending the wearing of masks with better filtration. “It\\'s not just wearing a cloth mask, but wear one with high filtration capability – a surgical mask or one of those with the filter inserts,” he said.“That is important because of the latest evidence about the nature of the various strains, how transmissible they are and the fact that the spread can happen through aerosolised particles.” Professor Laurent Rénia, who studies infectious diseases at Nanyang Technological University’s (NTU) Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, said the issue of airborne transmission is still a matter of debate in the scientific community. “But evidence is accumulating that short range aerosol transmission may occur,” he said. NCID’s ProfLeo said the larger amount of virus excreted by Delta variant cases could be spread through various modes of transmission, including direct contact, surfaces and airborne droplets. “When a person sneezes or coughs, he or she produces a range of particles of different size and weight,” she explained. “The very small and light particles can be dispersed a longer distance away and some might linger in the air for a longer period of time.” Professor Dale Fisher, senior consultant at the National University Hospital’s (NUH) division of infectious disease, believes the variants’ more infectious nature makes it seem like transmission modes have changed. “What might look like a change in the mode of transmission is actually just because the virus is less forgiving,” he said. “Now, if an aerosol could have transmitted it before uncommonly, well maybe now it might be a little bit more common.” VACCINES EFFECTIVE AGAINST VARIANTS? With the variants being more infectious and potentially spreading through the air, some have questioned how effective current vaccinations are against these strains. Some studies have shown that vaccines are slightly less effective against the Delta variant, but the experts were quick to stress that the jabs still offered good protection and helped reduce severe disease. For instance, Dr Leong Hoe Nam, infectious diseases specialist at the Rophi Clinic, pointed to a UK study that showed the Pfizer-BioNTech shot was 88 per cent effective against the Delta variant two weeks after the second dose.The Pfizer-BioNTech jab has a usual efficacy of about 95 per cent, meaning the chance of getting COVID-19 is 95 per cent lower after full vaccination. In the Delta variant clusters, Prof Leo has seen vaccinated cases with family members who have tested positive. This means it could still be possible for vaccinated people to spread the virus. “Genetic sequencing monitoring by the National Public Health Laboratory is still ongoing and we cannot rule out that a vaccinated patient is capable of transmitting the infection,” she said. Still, Dr Tambyah said a vaccine effectiveness of at least 80 per cent was “more than enough to eliminate the virus eventually when enough people are vaccinated”. “Vaccine breakthroughs occur with any virus, including the highly successful measles and chickenpox vaccines, but when enough people are vaccinated, the breakthroughs are rare and of limited public health significance,” he said. Dr Tambyah said vaccines have shown “time and again” to be the only way to end an epidemic, including in smallpox and to a lesser extent polio and measles.“Careful vaccination strategies are needed to ensure that the community transmission of the virus in Singapore is significantly reduced,” he said. Forty-nine per cent of the population have taken their first doses of vaccination, and “slightly over” 35 per cent are fully vaccinated with both doses, Mr Ong said on Friday.As of Jun 15, more than 4.7 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccination have been administered in Singapore, he added. More than 2.7 million people have received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Still, the experts said Singapore’s vaccination strategy could evolve as more people got their jabs. If evidence shows that the variants could “escape” the immune response induced by the vaccine or after natural infection, NTU’s Prof Rénia said a booster injection of a new vaccine with proteins from the variants could be necessary. Dr Tambyah also pointed to the possibility of the authorities introducing “ring vaccination”, when contacts of a single case or small cluster are quickly vaccinated. While this approach has yet to be tried in the COVID-19 pandemic, it proved effective in mumps outbreaks on US college campuses, he said. “It may not work for secondary cases but it will reduce further spread,” he added. TESTING AND CONTACT TRACING Vaccination is just one brick in the wall keeping COVID-19 variants at bay. Testing and tracing strategies are set to evolve as the vaccination rollout progresses, the experts said. Routine and large-scale testing for COVID-19 could become part of Singapore’s new normal. Singapore is shifting its approach to testing, and this must be done faster, more liberally and extensively, said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong in his televised speech in May. On Jun 16, rapid self-test kits went on sale in pharmacies. These help detect and isolate persons quickly when they are most infectious, and will be a “big help” in slowing the spread of COVID-19, Mr Lee said. With tests becoming faster and cheaper, routine testing could be done at more workplaces, restaurants and shopping malls, and for individuals like educators and taxi drivers whose jobs involve coming into close contact with many people, he said. Singapore will also contact trace more widely, Mr Lee said, with contact tracers working faster and better because they have more experience, skills and better tools like TraceTogether and SafeEntry. “I will be looking out for how the testing and contact tracing parts of the strategy change as vaccination increases,” NUS’ Asst Prof Clapham said. “Once we get to a very high proportion of the population vaccinated, we may worry less about asymptomatic infections, as we don’t have the same risk of these infections leading to outbreaks of severe disease.” IMPROVING SAFETY MEASURES Until then, organisations at ground zero of variant clusters continue to ramp up safety measures. Both TTSH and Changi Airport put in place restrictions on people entering their premises and completed at least one round of testing for thousands of employees while also introducing other safety measures. “We now know many of the cases infected with new variant strains of concern, including B16172, have higher quantities of virus in their secretion,” said ProfLeo, noting that the preventive measures then become “even more important”. These include keeping the environment clean and well ventilated, as well as reducing human-to-human contact, she added. Dr Hoi Shu Yin, chief nurse at TTSH, told CNA that the hospital is cleaning and auditing its wards for hygiene more frequently.“We also took steps to improve air ventilation in our wards by retrofitting all general wards and ward toilets with exhaust fans,” she said, adding that high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters have also been installed. Likewise, Changi Airport’s terminals have been fitted with HEPA filters that prevent stagnant air and ensure constant air flow in a single direction. Airport workers are now segregated according to their COVID-19 exposure risk, with no mingling between zones. Other high-risk places are doing more too. The Singapore General Hospital said staff working in wards are required to wear N95 respirators, rather than surgical masks, for “a better mask fit”. The hospital is also swabbing non-vaccinated staff weekly and vaccinated staff every two weeks, its director of infection prevention and epidemiology Dr Ling Moi Lin told CNA. “It is critical that we reduce the transmission of the virus rapidly with good public health measures … such as good hand hygiene and masking, adequate ventilation as well as increasing the percentage of vaccinated persons,” said Dr Ling.“As long as there are viruses circulating, there is an opportunity for variants to develop and we need to remove that opportunity.” WHAT YOU CAN DO On a personal level, the experts said the proper wearing of masks that meet filtration standards is integral in fighting back against the more infectious variants. In mid-May, health authorities recommended that people wear masks with better filtration amid a spike in variant cases and the emergence of new clusters. These masks, both single-use or reusable, should have at least a 95 per cent bacterial filtration efficiency, said MOH at the time. NCID’s Prof Leo reiterated that masks should closely and completely cover the nose and mouth. “If we sneeze or cough, do it with the mask on because we rely on the filtration function of the mask to limit the number of particles flowing out into the environment,” she said. Beyond masks, Prof Leo said the usual measures still apply: Hand hygiene, staying home as much as possible as well as early medical attention and testing. “It is important to remember prevention measures work hand in hand together. No one preventive measure can work alone,” she added. “Community resilience where everyone is doing their very best is key to combating SARS-CoV-2 that is elusive in nature.” To overcome the variants, NUH’s Prof Fisher said people should adhere to the same measures, like minimising contact with others, more seriously. “It’s more about doing all the things that we know and doing them well,” he added. “So it’s actually the same measures – they’re just being (implemented) more aggressively.” VARIANTS WILL CONTINUE TO EMERGE Nevertheless, the experts agreed that despite Singapore’s best efforts, different and new variants will probably continue to emerge and re-emerge over time. New strains that are even more transmissible and less virulent, meaning they cause less severe disease, are “extremely likely” to emerge, said Dr Tambyah. “After a few years, the virus will probably become like one of the common cold viruses widespread but deadly only to the elderly and vulnerable,” he added. Dr Tambyah highlighted the Russian flu in the late 19th century as one example of this. Iteventually became a seasonal coronavirus now seen regularly by doctors. The experts stressed that new variant strains arise when viruses evolve to adapt and evade human defences, with each variant bringing different challenges. “Most experts, including myself, believe that SARS-CoV-2, unlike SARS-CoV (which caused the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), will stay with us,” said ProfLeo.“It will continue to evolve and we humans will continue to develop defence mechanisms such as vaccines and treatment.” The human versus COVID-19 struggle is “expected to be dynamic” and “occasionally volatile with blips of resurgence” in cases, she said. “We foresee ongoing restriction-relaxation to achieve some degree of balance allowing the healthcare system to cope with the cases and the entire society to return to the desired state of productivity,” she added. But Dr Leong at the Rophi Clinic warned against a lapse in measures like wearing masks and safe distancing, highlighting that the coronavirus could “mutate against the vaccine”. “The weaker we are in this defence, the more likely replication and in turn mutations and variants appear,” he added. “Disorganised, half-hearted attempts are exactly the prescription for viral mutants.” It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

This represents around 96 per cent of the more than 310,000 eligible students whohave registered for vaccination appointments since Jun 1, the ministry said in a joint press release with theSingapore Examinations and Assessment Board (SEAB). MOE and SEAB also outlined details of its safe management measures for PSLE and GCE oral examinations. MASKS MANDATORY FOR ORAL EXAMINATIONS To minimise the risk of COVID-19 transmission,all candidates and oral examiners will be required to wear surgical masks. \"As facial expressions will not be taken into consideration for the assessment, candidates will not be disadvantaged by the wearing of surgical masks during oral examinations,\" MOE and SEAB said. Before the start of the oral examination, examiners will ask candidates to state their name and school loudly, in order to ensure they can hear each other clearly. Candidates and examiners can also ask each other tospeak louder or repeat their questions.A placardreminding candidates of this will also be placed in front of them. They will not be penalised for making such requests. Examiners will also take mask-wearing into consideration when assessing candidates, said MOE and SEAB. Othersafe management measures will also continue to be in place, includingtemperature and symptom screening, staggered dismissal of candidates, frequent cleaning of high touch surfaces and using well-ventilated venues such as halls and classrooms for examinations. Candidates will not be allowed to sit fororal and listening comprehension examinations if they have COVID-19,are on quarantine order or a stay-home notice or have been issued with a leave of absence. Those on medical leave due to acute respiratory infection or are onapproved absence will also be barred from attending the examinations. As oral examinations are conducted over several days, those who miss their assigned date with valid reasons can take the examination on another date within the window or sit for a make-up oral examination, said MOE and SEAB. Candidates who are unable to take up either option can apply forspecial consideration - a procedure thatawards candidates with projected gradesobtained through considering their performance in other papers for a subjectin national and school-based examinations. Special considerationwill also take into account the school cohort\\'s performance. All applicationsare \"assessed on a case-by-case basis and subjected to a rigorous review process\". REMOVAL OF COMMON LAST TOPICS FOR PSLE Common Last Topics (CLT), which were removed from the national examinations for graduating cohorts due to the impact of last year\\'s \"circuit breaker\" period on curriculum time, will continue to be excluded for PSLE examinations in 2021. CLTs area set of topics identified from subject syllabuses by the Education Ministry to be taught last by all schools for graduating cohorts. MOE and SEAB said that schools were able to draw on theirthree-and-a-half week experience ofhome-based learning (HBL)in 2020, allowing them tocarry out seven days of full HBL \"smoothly\" from May 19 to May 28. They are expected to be able to coverthe examinable curriculum \"in good time\" for national examinations in 2021, said the two bodies. \"However, Primary 6 students may encounter additional disruptions to their learning compared to other graduating cohorts as a significant proportion of our P6 students are still not eligible for the COVID-19 vaccination due to age,\" MOEand SEAB said. With the rise of more infectious variants of COVID-19, the need foroccasional instances of full HBL in primary schools \"cannot be ruled out\". The fact that younger Primary 6 students may not learn as effectively during HBL was also taken into consideration, said MOE and SEAB. The CLTs that will be removed in this year\\'sPSLE are as follows: \"This move aims to support the wellbeing of our P6 students, who also have to familiarise themselves with the new PSLE Achievement Level scoring system,\" said MOE and SEAB. RESUMPTION OF CCAsPUSHED BACK The resumption of in-person Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) will be pushed backby at least a week, MOE and SEAB said. MOE earlier announced thatfollowing students\\' return to schools from Jun 28, CCAs would resume from thesecond week of Term 3. In line with the national posture on the evolving COVID-19 situation,CCAs insecondary schools, junior colleges and Millennia Institutewill resume on Jul 12, the third week of Term 3. In-person CCAs will resumefor primary schools in the fifth week of Term 3. MOE and SEAB said that theywill continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation and provide updates if there are further changes to the arrangements for this year’s national examinations and school activities. \"We hope that these measures will give our students and their parents greater peace of mind,\" saidEducation Minister Chan Chun Sing in a Facebook post.

       " {'text': 'covid 19 man jailed breach stay home notice wife birthday 15082904 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: A man was sentenced to seven days in jail on Thursday (Jun 24) for leaving the hotel room where he was serving his COVID-19 stay-home notice last year and going to meet his wife to celebrate his birthday. Bai Fan, a 38-year-old American and Singapore permanent resident, had arrived at Changi Airport Terminal 1 on Sep 19, 2020 from Shanghai, following a 19-hour transit in Hong Kong. The court heard that Bai’s request to serve his stay-home notice at his residence rather than at a dedicated facility was denied. This was because a surge in COVID-19 cases in Hong Kong at the time meant it was mandatory that all travellers with a travel history to the territory - including those in transit - would have to serve their notice at a dedicated facility. Deputy Public Prosecutor Timotheus Koh noted that an Immigration and Checkpoints Authority officer told Bai to remain in his room at the Fairmont Hotel on Bras Basah Road for the duration of his notice period -from Sep 19 to Oct 3 last year - and to call a hotline if he required assistance during that time. The accused was said to have understood the instructions. When he arrived at the accommodation, hotel staff reminded him that he was to remain in his room and told him to read an information sheet issued by the Singapore Tourism Board, which included a reminder to stay in the room at all times during the 14-day period. Investigations showed that on Sep 20, 2020, the accused spoke to his wife over the phone and asked her to get a birthday cake for him, said Mr Koh. The couple arranged to meet near the hotel, with Bai’s wife driving the family car to pick him up. Bai left his room at 7.05pm that day and made his way from the Fairmont Hotel’s South Tower, where his room was, to the North Tower, which was occupied by guests who were not on stay-home notice. The prosecution pointed out that the doors linking the north and south towers were barricaded by furniture to prevent people from crossing between the two towers. “The accused circumvented the barricades and entered the North Tower,” said Mr Koh, noting Bai then took the lift down to the hotel driveway, where he met his wife and boarded the car. Bai’s wife then drove the car to the basement carpark of the hotel, where they had a “long talk about their relationship”, the prosecution added. After their time together, Bai\\'s wife drove him back, dropping him off at the hotel driveway. Bai re-entered his room at 12.08 am. Despite having reason to suspect he had come into contact with COVID-19 due to his transit in Hong Kong, Bai had chosen to breach his stay-home notice requirements and expose others to the risk of infection, Mr Koh said. Bai’s lawyer, SS Dhillon, noted that his client had originally travelled from mainland China - which did not require a stay-home notice - and that he did not interact with anyone nor leave the airport lounge during his transit in Hong Kong. Bai was thus \"mentally totally unprepared” to serve a two-week stay-home notice, Mr Dhillon said, adding that his client would not have flown to Singapore had he known he would have to serve the notice. Mr Dhillon noted that CCTV footage showed that his client had worn a mask at all times while outside his hotel room. In addition, Bai was shown to not have COVID-19 at the end of his stay-home notice, proving he was of “no risk” during that time, the lawyer said. A 10-day jail term as the prosecution had called for would be disproportionate, given his client’s “low risk of transmission” and “low culpability”, Mr Dhillon said. The prosecution however countered that the defence’s emphasis on Bai’s original point of departure being Shanghai was a “red herring”, given the restrictions on all travellers who had travelled through Hong Kong at the time. In addition, Mr Koh pointed out that Bai had moved through publicly accessible areas and had deliberately circumvented security measures to meet with his wife. A separate charge of meeting his wife on Sep 19 was taken into consideration. An ICA statement in March noted the couple had spent about an hour and 40 minutes together in the car on that date. For committing an offence under the Infectious Diseases (COVID-19 - Stay Orders) Regulations 2020, Bai could have been jailed for up to six months, fined up to S$10,000 or both. Foreign nationals face further penalties, including the revoking or shortening of their permits and passes to remain or work in Singapore.

       " {'text': 'covid 19 sydney lockdown delta variant 15103402 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SYDNEY:Millions of Sydney residents began the first full day of a two-week coronavirus lockdown on Sunday (Jun 27), as Australia imposed new restrictions to contain an outbreak of the highly contagious Delta variant. Restaurants, bars and cafes were shuttered after stay-at-home orders for central neighbourhoods were extended Saturday evening across the sprawling city and to the coastal and mountainous regions surrounding it. While the city centre was virtually deserted, large numbers of surfers and swimmers hit the water at Sydney\\'s Bondi Beach, with outdoor exercise still allowed. Australia\\'s northern city of Darwin also entered a separate snap 48-hour lockdown on Sunday after a handful of cases were linked to a coronavirus outbreak on a remote gold mine. Northern Territory Chief Minister Michael Gunner said officials were concerned about being unable to reach close contacts of infected people in the region, home to a large Indigenous population feared to be more vulnerable to COVID-19. \"We are taking extreme action right now to stop or slow any spread before the coronavirus is let loose in the Territory, and that means we need a lockdown,\" he said. Health experts had advised that a shorter snap lockdown of Sydney - which has proved effective in other Australian cities in recent months - would not be enough to contain the growing cluster, New South Wales state Premier Gladys Berejiklian said. More than 110 COVID-19 cases have been reported since a driver for an international flight crew tested positive in mid-June to the highly contagious Delta variant, which first emerged in India. \"Given how contagious this strain of the virus is, we do anticipate that in the next few days case numbers are likely to increase even beyond what we have seen today,\" Berejiklian told reporters Sunday. TESTING TIME The flare-up has been a shock for a city that had returned to relative normality after months with few local cases. Matt Daly, 37, who lives south of Sydney, said he supported the measures but anticipated a \"testing\" period of working from home and entertaining his two young children who are on school holidays. \"A lot of juggling over the next two weeks. Really hope it doesn\\'t extend further,\" he told AFP. Sydney\\'s restrictions require people to stay home until at least Jul9, only venturing out to purchase essential goods, obtain medical care, exercise, go to school or if they are unable to work from home. Professional musician Blain Cunneen, 27, said his work -performing gigs, studio sessions and teaching students - had gone \"up in smoke\" overnight. \"All that was starting to operate again almost as normal... very suddenly overnight I got a bunch of emails and texts about everything being cancelled,\" he told AFP. Anyone outside of the lockdown zone who had visited Sydney since Monday was also instructed to self-isolate for 14 days, while several other states have banned travel to and from the city. It is the latest in a string of \"circuit-breaker\" lockdowns across major Australian metropolises, with most cases linked to quarantining returning travellers. More than 150,000 people in Darwin and surrounding areas are under stay-at-home orders for at least 48 hours to give health officials time to trace contacts, for the first time since a nationwide shutdown in the early stages of the pandemic. \"The Northern Territory is now facing its biggest threat since the COVID-19 crisis began,\" Gunner said. Cases of COVID-19 were also detected in the major cities of Perth and Brisbane on Sunday, prompting local authorities to tighten restrictions. Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt said he was confident Australia would manage. \"It\\'s a difficult day but we\\'ve done this before, we know how to do it. And we will get through it,\" he said. Australia has been among the world\\'s most successful countries in containing COVID-19, with just over 30,000 cases and 910 deaths in a population of about 25 million. However, the government has faced criticism for a sluggish vaccine rollout.

       " {'text': 'singapore stay home notice higher risk covid 19 self test 15073232 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: The stay-home notice period fornew travellers from higher-risk countries or regions will be shortenedfrom 21 days to 14 days from Jun 24, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Wednesday (Jun 23). This is\"based on updated evidence gathered over the past month\", MOH added. These travellers will be required to test themselves regularly with self-administered antigen rapid test (ART) kits in addition to the existing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests. Until recently, \"little was known about the emerging variant of concern, including its incubation period\", said the ministry.As a precaution, MOH had required travellers with recent travel history to higher-risk places to serve a 21-day stay-home notice. All countries and regions are considered higher-risk except Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Hong Kong, Macau, mainland Chinaand New Zealand. \"We have since reviewed the international evidence and local case data,\" MOH said, adding that it had \"found no evidence - from both overseas and local data - that these variants come with longer incubation periods\". Since the 21-day stay-home notice period for those with recent travel history to higher-risk places was implemented on May 8, Singapore has had 270 imported cases among this groupas of Jun 22, said the ministry. \"All of them had incubation periods well within the 14-day window,\" MOH said. \"As such, we will reduce the SHN period from 21 days back to 14 days.\" TRAVELLERS TO SELF-TEST New travellers will be required to test themselves regularly with ARTself-test kits on days three, sevenand 11 of their arrival in Singapore, while serving their stay-home notice, MOH said. This is \"to identify potential infection cases early and provide infected travellers with appropriate medical care as soon as possible\", given thehigher transmissibility of new variants of concern, the ministry added. The new testing requirement will be implemented for new travellers who arrivefrom 11.59pm on Jun 27. They will also have to take PCRtests on arrival in Singapore, and on day 14, before they end their stay-home notice. TRAVELLERS ARRIVING FROM TAIWAN AND ISRAEL Travellers arriving from Taiwan and Israel will be able to apply to serve their 14-day stay-home notice at their place of residence and not at a dedicated facility. They must apply before arrival and must have spent the last 21 days prior to travel in Taiwan or Israel to be eligible. Travellersmust also be occupying their place of residence alone or with household members with the same travel history who are also serving the same stay-home notice duration, MOH said. \"Refund details are being worked out for travellers who are affected by these changes, and will be shared with them separately,\" the Health Ministry added. They will also have to undergo testing using the same regular self-administered ART kits and PCR tests. NO CHANGE FOR MIGRANT WORKERS, SEA CREW MEMBERS There is no change for migrant workers from higher-risk countries or regions who stay in dormitories or work in the Construction, Marine and Process (CMP) sector. They will continue to spend an additional seven days at the Migrant Worker Onboarding Centre or at a dedicated facility after their initial 14-day stay-home notice, MOH said. The additionalstay, which has been implemented since early this year,will include an extra testing regime, medical examination and, if required, a settling-in programme. \"This precautionary measure will further minimise any small risk of imported COVID-19 positive cases transmitting the virus into the dormitories or at the worksites which can result in large clusters, and will be regularly reviewed as the COVID-19 situation evolves,\" MOH said. New crew members from higher-risk places who are entering Singapore on a long-term permit to work onboard harbour craft operating in the port of Singapore will have similar requirements. After their 14-day stay-home notice, they will undergo \"an additional seven-day stay and testing regime at a dedicated facility\" before they are allowed to commence work onboard a craft. \"This will serve as a precaution in view of the essential marine services that the harbour craft provide to support our supply chain,\" said MOH.

       " {'text': 'covid 19 bukit merah market cluster vaccine 15082866 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: Of the COVID-19caseslinked to a cluster at 115 Bukit Merah View Market and Hawker Centre, more than half were not vaccinated, while about a third were fully vaccinated,said Associate Professor Kenneth Mak, the Health Ministry’s director of medical services, on Thursday (Jun 24). Specifically, out of the 82 cases, 51.1 per cent of the cases were not vaccinated, while 36.7 per cent of them were fully vaccinated, noted Assoc Prof Mak at a press conference by the COVID-19 multi-ministry task force. Amongthose who were vaccinated, the majority were either mildly symptomaticor asymptomatic, he said. He added that 46 of these cases were not “household-related”,and 16 of these cases had been detected from surveillance or community testing operations. A total of 27 cases had been isolated or quarantined before detection. In addition, nearly 47 per cent of the linked cases were above the age of 60, Assoc Prof Mak said. This comes as the Bukit Merah market and food centre cluster “continues to grow”, while additional smaller clusters have emerged from it too, said co-chair of the task force, Mr Gan Kim Yong. “Any of these new clusters can become another big cluster if we are not careful.” Assoc Prof Makadded that the clusters in the Bukit Merah and Tiong Bahru area areof concern to authorities, and they continue to monitor them. In the meantime, results of phylogenetic studies are pending, before any links to the Bukit Merah View market cluster can be confirmed, he said. Assoc Prof Mak added that this area of concern was picked up as a result of the clusters identified, and supported by other tests conducted. “For example, wastewater testing that allows us to understand whether there might be cryptic chains of transmission occurring within the area,” said Assoc Prof Mak. These tests have also allowed authorities to “sharpen” strategies for heightening community surveillance through aggressive testing in the area, such as in the Enabling Village and the Redhill area, he noted. In addition, authorities mapped areas that people might have moved around to, and included these within the boundaries for testing. This was to avoid missing out \"various nexus of activity that may be contributing towards cryptic spread\", said Assoc Prof Mak. AGGRESSIVE COMMUNITY SURVEILLANCE Assoc Prof Mak added that over the last three weeks, “aggressive community surveillance” has been conducted, with at least 219,000 tests having been carried out in various areas, such as dormitories, workplaces and community areas. He noted that overall, the number of community cases hadincreased in the past week, compared to the week before. But the proportion of unlinked cases hadfallen from 25 per centto 21 per cent in the same period, he said. “Household transmission appears to be decreasing. Those that were detected on entry into quarantine has also further decreased from 18.8 per cent on the 16th of June, to 5.5 per cent as of the 22nd. “And this suggests that we are getting more cases more quickly as a result of all of the aggressive testing that we\\'ve been doing.” Assoc Prof Mak also noted that out of the 141 cases admitted to hospitals, there are five cases in the intensive care unit (ICU) – all of whom were unvaccinated. “It reinforces our concern that those who are not vaccinated, if infected, may get a more aggressive course of disease, a more severe course of disease, may require oxygen supplementation, or even ICU care.” He said that this was also borne out by the Bukit Merah View market cluster, despite seniors comprising a high proportion of cases. “This reinforces the call that we\\'ve been giving: for all who have yet to be vaccinated, to step forward and make use of the opportunities that are coming up to register and be vaccinated. \"Our seniors, in particular, will be hard hit if the clusters increase, or if more clusters like we see in Bukit Merahthen break through in our community.\" Downloadourappor subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

StarMed Specialist Centre, which has been approved to administer the Government's stock of Sinovac COVID-19 vaccines, told CNA on Wednesday (Jun 23) that it wasworkingwith another clinic to import more doses of Sinovac as well as other vaccine brands such as Sinopharm. “We’re just seeing a lot of demand for these vaccines that are approved under the (special access route) that are non-mRNA based and at this stage, it’s really just exploratory, to understand whether it's possible, and what are the regulatory and logistic hurdles that are involved in bringing in these vaccines,” said the centre’s chief executive officer Dr Louis Tan. The other clinic - one of the 24 clinics approved to administer the Sinovac shots - has declined to be named, citing concerns such as being inundated with queries. Last week, several clinics were flooded with hundreds of enquiries about the Sinovac COVID-19 vaccine, after MOH released its list of approvedclinicsto administer the shots. At least four healthcare institutions including StarMed Specialist Centre, have started administering the shots. Dr Tan said his centre is currently administering around 80 doses a dayand has vaccinated more than 200 patients since it received its first shipment of Sinovac shots last Friday. The second shipment of 200 doses arrived on Monday. “We’re going to keep at this (pace) for a while, then maybe a month later, we’ll step it up to 120 doses a day,” he said. “The rationale is because a month later is when people need to start coming in for the second dose so ... if I can only take in 80 vaccinations per day, it would mean that - one month later - I won't be able to vaccinate new patients anymore.” He added that more than 4,000 people have scheduled vaccination appointments at the centre, with bookings running up to the end of September. Thomson Wellth Clinic, which also received its first shipment of Sinovac vaccines last Friday, said it has been managing appointment bookings for more than 1,500 individuals who registered their interest to receive the Sinovac vaccine. It said it is able to administer about 150 vaccinations a day and has vaccinated about 400 people so far. “The clinic has a large seating area which can accommodate high throughput, with adequate safe-distancing measures in place, as such, the clinic is able to comfortably accept walk-in patients and if we have spare capacity, they can receive their vaccinations on the spot,” said Thomson Medical spokesperson. “We are prepared to extend our operating hours to meet demand, if necessary.” REPORTING SIDE EFFECTS FROM SINOVAC VACCINES Clinics CNA spoke to said they had a reporting protocol in place to document data related to the Sinovac vaccine. This includes collecting data on serious adverse side effects from the vaccine. Ms Serena Wee, chief executive of Icon Cancer Centre Farrer Park, told CNA that a dedicated phone line has been set up for patient to report any reactions from the vaccine. To date, the centre has received only one report from a patient who developed a rash after the injection, said Ms Wee, adding that the case has been recorded and reported to MOH. Thomson Wellth Clinic and StarMed Specialist Centre told CNA that they have not observed any serious reactions, such as anaphylaxis, so far. CNA has contacted MOH and the Health Sciences Authority for more information on the alternative vaccines being imported through the special access route and the healthcare institutions that have applied for them.

Lockdown measures were set to end on Monday. But Muhyiddin said they will not be eased until daily cases fell below 4,000, Bernama said. Senior Minister for Defence Ismail Sabri Yaakob also said that Phase 1 of the movement control order will be maintained until the three key threshold value indicators are achieved. The indicators are that the number of daily COVID-19 cases drop to below 4,000, the rate of bed usage in intensive care units is at a moderate level and that 10 per cent of the population has received two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine. \"Based on the risk evaluation carried out by the Ministry of Health, the government will maintain the Phase 1 period nationwide,\" said Ismail Sabri in a statement. \"This takes into account the current situation, which has yet to successfully transition from Phase 1 to Phase 2, where the graph on daily COVID-19 positive cases shows a horizontal trend,\" he added. The minister also said that restaurants could operate from 6am to 10pm starting Monday. Currently restaurants are only allowed to operate from 8am to 8pm. He said the decision was made after taking into account the appeals from and the views of food outlet operators. Malaysia reported 5,803 cases on Saturday. In May, a nationwide movement control order(MCO) was re-imposed in Malaysia amid a third wave of COVID-19 cases. Known as MCO 3.0, all economic sectors were allowed to operate during the period but cross-district and interstate travel as well as social, sports and educational activities were prohibited. Stricter restrictions on the economic and social sectors were later announced on May 21 as community cases continued to rise. On Jun 11,Ismail Sabriannounced in a statement that the MCO, which was then due to end on Jun 14,would be extended to Jun 28.

Nineteen were linked to previous cases, with 17 already on quarantine and two detected through surveillance, said the Ministry of Health (MOH). There were also seven imported cases, who had beenplaced on stay-home notice upon arrival in Singapore. No new infections were reported in migrant workers\\' dormitories. In all, Singapore reported 31 new COVID-19 cases on Wednesday. TESTING FOR VISITORS TO 455 SENGKANG WEST AVENUE MOH said it is investigating cases of COVID-19 infection among visitors to shops at 455 Sengkang West Avenue. To \"pre-emptively mitigate\" any potential risk of wider, undetected community transmission, MOH said it will offer free COVID-19 testing for members of the public who visited these shops from May 12 to May 30. These visitors were also advised to monitor their health closely for 14 days from their date of visit, and to visit a regional screening centre or Swab and Send Home (SASH) Public Health Preparedness Clinic for a free COVID-19 test. MINDSVILLE@NAPIRI CLUSTER A total of 27 people at MINDSville@Napiri Adult Disability Home have tested positive forCOVID-19, the Ministry of Social and Family Development said on Wednesday. This comes after one of the residents, a 37-year-old Singaporean woman,was confirmed to have the infection on Monday. Identified as Case 63924, she was initially identified as an unlinked case in MOH\\'s update on Tuesday. MOH included four of the new MINDSville cases in the cluster in its daily case count on Wednesday. It said that it would include the remaining 22 cases in Thursday’s case count following verification of the test results. The facility has 112 residents. CASES FROM HOUGANG, YISHUN AMONG UNLINKED INFECTIONS Two unlinked cases reported on Wednesday were detected during the testing of residents at HDB blocks in Hougang and Yishun. They include a 43-year-old Singaporean who works in an administrative role at Changi Prison Complex, and was last at her workplace on Mar 2. The woman, who is fully vaccinated, developed a cough on May 29 but did not seek medical attention. She took a COVID-19 test on Jun 1 as part of the Health Ministry’s special testing operations for residents of Hougang Avenue 8. She developed a sore throat, blocked nose and loss of taste the next day, and her test came back positive for COVID-19 infection the same day. The second case is an 80-year-old Singaporean who is a retiree. The woman, who is also fully vaccinated, was tested for COVID-19 on Jun 1 as part of special testing operations for residents of Yishun Street 72. She was asymptomatic but her test came back positive for COVID-19 infection on the same day. Her serology test result is negative for the N antigen, which suggests early infection, MOH said. The ministry also said in a separate update that it has concluded testing operations for residents and visitors at Block 745 Yishun Street 72, with three people testing positive as of 10pm on Wednesday. Details on the positive cases will be reported in upcoming press releases, it said. Testing at Blocks 501 and 507 at Hougang Avenue 8 is ongoing, with 681 people tested and one confirmed case as of 10pm on Wednesday, it said. The other unlinked cases include a 22-year-old Myanmar national who works as a healthcare assistant at Grace Lodge nursing home and a 36-year-old Vietnam national who is a homemaker. The remaining unlinked case is a 61-year-old Singaporean who works at Singapore Pools at NTUC FairPrice along Clementi Avenue 3. The woman was last at work on May 26 and received her first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine on May 30. The woman developed body aches on the same day she took her vaccine, and subsequently a fever and sore throat on Jun 1. She sought medical treatment at a clinic on the same day, where she underwent an antigen rapid test (ART). She was immediately isolated when her ART result came back positive, and a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test was administered. Her PCR testalso came back positive for COVID-19 infection on Jun 1. CHANGI PRISON COMPLEX CLUSTER One more case has been linked to the Changi Prison Complex cluster, bringing the number of infections in the cluster to 15. The 46-year-old Singaporean inmate had already been quarantined after being identified as a close contact of a previously confirmed case, a 39-year-old Chinese national who is employed by SATS Food Services as a cook at Changi Prison Complex. MOH said the inmate was tested regularly for COVID-19 during quarantine – the last test being onMay 29 – and all his test results were negative. He is asymptomatic and was detected when he was tested again onMay 31. He has tested preliminarily positive for the B1617 variant, and is pending further confirmatory tests. HONG YE GROUP CLEANERS CLUSTER Two students and a homemaker have been added to the Hong Ye Group cleaners cluster, which now has 25 confirmed cases. Two of the cases were asymptomatic and detected from testing during quarantine: A 52-year-old Singaporean homemaker and a four-year-old Singaporean boy who attends The Spark Playhouse at 406 Hougang Avenue 10. The two are family members of the same previously confirmed case. The remaining case is a nine-year-old Singaporean who is a student at Fu Hua Primary School. The boy was last in school on May 18. He developed a fever on May 31 and went to a clinic the next day, where he underwent an ART and PCR test. He was immediately isolated when his ART result came back positive on Jun 1. He was also quarantined on Jun 1 ashe had been identified as a family member of another previously confirmed case.His PCR test came back positive for COVID-19 on Jun 2. MASSEUSE LINKED TO CHEVY’S BAR AND BISTRO CLUSTER A 30-year-old Malaysian who works as a massage therapist at Zenith Healing @ La Maison De Ja has been linked to this cluster. She is a close contact of a previously confirmed case, a 21-year-old Malaysian who works as a kitchen staff member at Indo Bowl at 39 Sultan Gate. She developed a sore throat and cough during quarantine on May 28, but her COVID-19 test the same day came back negative. The woman subsequently developed a fever on Jun 1, and tested positive this time. The Chevy’s Bar and Bistro cluster has now grown to seven cases. NTUC FOODFARE ANCHORVALE A 20-year-old Vietnam national has been linked to the cluster at NTUC Foodfare at 308 Anchorvale Road. The woman, who works as a kitchen assistant at the coffee shop, developed a fever onMay 29 but did not seek medical attention. She was quarantined on May 30 after she was identified as a close contact of a previously confirmed case, a 23-year-old Malaysian who works as a cook at West Grill Station (Anchorvale). The woman was tested for COVID-19 on Jun 1, with the result coming back positive. This cluster now has a total of 10 infections. NEW CLUSTER Two Singaporeans, aged three and 71, have been linked to a previously confirmed case, forming a new cluster. Both of them had already been quarantined and are close contacts of Case 63941, the 36-year-old Vietnam national who was listed as an unlinked case on Wednesday. The three-year-old boy is a student atPCF Sparkletots Preschool (Kreta Ayer – Kim Seng), and was last in school onMay 14.He experienced symptoms such as runny nose, cough, body aches and headache prior to testing positive for COVID-19. The 71-year-old womanworks as a stall assistant at 328 Katong Laksa Tiong Bahru Plaza and was last at work on May 27. She developed a cough, body aches and headaches on May 28 but did not seek medical attention. She tested positive for COVID-19 on Jun 1 during quarantine. GLENEAGLES HOSPITAL TECHNICIAN AMONG NEW CASES More cases have been traced to two existing clusters. The first cluster is linked to a previously confirmed COVID-19 case, a 49-year-old permanent resident who works as a manager at Success Consultancy. The four new cases linked to him include a61-year-old Singaporean who works as a technician at Gleneagles Hospital, a 36-year-old permanent resident who worksas a senior executive at ICFC and a 61-year-old Singaporean who works as a canteenvendor at Greenwood Primary School. The remaining case is a 39-year-old Singaporean who works at Versaform. The second cluster is linked to a65-year-old Singaporeanhomemaker who was confirmed to have COVID-19 on May 30. Two more cases have been linked to the woman: A 93-year-old Singaporean retiree and a 28-year-old Singaporean who works at the Typo shop at Westgate. The 28-year-oldwas tested for COVID-19 onMay 28 as part of testing operations for those who worked in or visited JEM or Westgate. ATATCUTZ BARBER IS CLOSE CONTACT OF PIZZA HUT DELIVERY RIDER The remaining linked case announced on Wednesday is a 24-year-old Malaysianwho works as a barber at Atatcutz Singapore at 348 Bedok Road. The man is a close contact of a previously confirmed COVID-19 case, a26-year-old Malaysian man who works as a delivery rider for Pizza Hut at Hougang Green. MOH said he developed a fever, cough and runny nose on May 29 but did not seek medical attention. He was quarantined on Jun 1 and reported his symptoms. He was tested for COVID-19 on the same day and his test came back positive on Jun 2. DECREASE IN COMMUNITY CASES MOH said the overall number of new cases in the community has decreased from 165 cases in the week before to 126 cases in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has also fallen from 30 cases in the week before to 27 cases in the past week. Among the 184 confirmed cases reported from May 27 to Jun 2, a total of 55 cases have tested positive for their serology tests while 108 have tested negative. A further 21 serology test results are pending. The Health Ministry added several new locations to its list of places visited by COVID-19 cases in the community during their infectious period. The places include shopping malls Causeway Point and Tiong Bahru Plaza, as well as Masjid Jamek Queenstown and Marina Bay Sands Casino. Among the seven imported cases, there are two Singaporeans and four permanent residents who returned from India and the United Arab Emirates. The remaining imported case is a long-term visit pass holder who arrived from India. 42MORE PATIENTS DISCHARGED MOH also announced the closure of the Tuas South Community Care Facility cluster, as no cases have been linked to it for the past two incubation periods. Forty-two more cases have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities, taking Singapore\\'s total recoveries to 61,523. There are 216 cases still in hospital. Most of them are stable or improving, and two are in critical condition in the intensive care unit. Another 328 are being isolated and cared for at community facilities. As of Wednesday, Singapore has reported a total of 62,100COVID-19 cases and 33 fatalities.

       " {'text': 'covid 19 coronavirus singapore mental health hotline resource 14899148 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners Urgent attention must be paid to the impact of this raging pandemic on our mental health, former NMP and mental health advocate Anthea Ong urges. SINGAPORE: “It feels like deja vu,” a young community worker said, a day after the tightened measures for Phase 2 came into effect. He remembers the stress and manic scramble to support children living in rental flats and transitional shelters for home-based learning. He recalls helping migrant workers with food and essential items during the outbreak in the dormitories at the onset of circuit breaker last year. Just 10 days later, two friends with home-based businesses reliant on clients coming to their homes experienced heart palpitations following the announcement of the two-person cap as part of Phase 2 (Heightened Alert). They are not alone in feeling nervous about the COVID-19 situation in Singapore. Calls to some mental health hotlines saw a spike on Sunday (May 16), the first day of the latest phase of COVID-19 restrictions, executives who run these hotlines tell me. COVID-19 HAS TAKEN AN EMOTIONAL TOLL ON US Psychologists have pointed out how stressors released over the uncertainty over livelihoods, routines and catching a deadly virus have created a sense of constant danger and exerted an emotional toll on us. After a year of dealing with a raging pandemic, we have seen signs of increased stress and worry, even when Singapore was doing well in curbing infection numbers. More than nine in 10 Singaporeans (91 per cent) have said that their mental health has declined in the last year, according to a study by AIA last month. The sources are multifold. In the #AreWeOkay poll by SG Mental Health Matters conducted between March and April, 51.2 per cent of respondents said the restrictions on social activities and interactions have negatively impacted their mental health. Forty-four per cent said that changes to work and school had a similar effect. As cases ticked up in recent weeks, fuelling calls for a clean circuit breaker to be pulled, I would argue we should be careful not to do so lightly, not without preparing for the mental health support needed. After all, during the circuit breaker last year, the Samaritans of Singapore received over 10,000 calls in distress, a 36 per cent increase. Over the same period, the non-profit organisation Caregivers’ Alliance supported 11 caregivers, of which six had lost their loved ones to suicide and the remaining five struggling with family members attempting suicide. (Mental health groups have seen a surge in calls since COVID-19 hit.Who are the people tirelessly manning these helplines? Find out on Heart of the Matter.) It looks like the email address you entered is not valid. MANY INITIATIVES SPRINGING UP OVER PAST YEAR People focus on the financial costs and risk of deep economic scarring when restrictions slow recovery. Just as important but less talked about is the price of loneliness and social withdrawal, domestic violence and unresolved grief, not to mention work-from-home stress and the helplessness over an uncertain, volatile future. There are baby steps to build resilience and support people as this coronavirus persists and should additional restrictions be required. Many government-led and community initiatives have sprung up. A National Care Hotline was set up in April last year manned by officers trained to provide mental health first aid and refer cases to public healthcare institutions and community service providers to follow up if necessary. These benefitted 30,000 calls as of October 2020. The Ministry of Social & Family Development also recently launched a 24-hour National Anti-Violence Helpline for the public to report cases of family violence, abuse and neglect. It is also heartening to see targeted efforts to aid specific groups, like the Seniors Go Digital Programme to help seniors connect online with friends, family and government services. There is also a budding recognition that workplaces must step up where the stressors can come from work. More employers, like the CEOs and leaders I work with at the WorkWell Leaders Workgroup, have accelerated plans for employee mental well-being including work-from-home support programmes in the last year. THE BIG CHALLENGES FOR MENTAL HEALTH Yet let’s be clear about the enormity of the mental health challenges that lie head. While we are better prepared for a second circuit breaker, we carry more baggage picked up from a year of economic uncertainty, pandemic fatigue and the emotional roller-coaster of on-off restriction measures. The mental health divide has also widened, as pandemic measures have a greater impact on segments requiring more attention. Blue-collar workers and low-income individuals were the hardest hit by the circuit breaker. Incomes at the 20th percentile fell4.5 per cent in June 2020 compared to the same period in 2019, according to the Ministry of Manpower’s Labour Force report. Last year’s circuit breaker also shone the spotlight on isolation’s ill effects - on victims of family violence trapped with abusers, migrant workers confined to dorms and foreign domestic workers with little space away from their employers. Would people also know how to find help? Less than one in three (29.7 per cent) of respondents to the #AreWeOkay knew how to seek out subsidised mental healthcare. REFRAMING THE CONVERSATIONS OVER MENTAL HEALTH Updates given by the COVID-19 Multi-Ministry Taskforce (MTF) have rightly been focused on the number and breakdown of infections, the ensuing control measures and economic relief support for those affected. Yet let’s also hope that each MTF incorporates an update on mental health strategies included into our pandemic management approach and provide reminders on the mental health support resources available, as much as reminders to see the doctor if unwell or take a swab test if one has been to an area of infections have become commonplace. “What gets measured gets done” is a maxim that should apply to the rate of infections as much as rates of anxiety, depression, self-harm, suicide and other mental health issues from this pandemic, an urgent call also made by psychiatrists and psychologists in The Lancet. The Government had promised a whole-of-government review of all mental health policies in the Budget 2020 parliamentary debates, an inter-agency mental health task force has been set up last October and three new priorities were announced during the Budget this year. Yet more needs to be done urgently, including improving accessibility, affordability and quality of mental healthcare. Here is also where our national leaders could show compassion to acknowledge the dread and apprehension among those who have been quarantined or received a notification of possible exposure on their TraceTogether app. Leaders can also demonstrate sensitivity to people’s concerns and needs. Each day’s updates brings a sense of fear reflecting uncertainties around elderly relatives who live away by themselves, employment, healthcare and family care for many - even if others may just merely let out another collective sigh and move on. The trauma experienced from COVID-19 also gets repeated in varying degrees with every announcement of more clusters and each round of new restrictions. This persistent COVID-19 crisis is equally a mental health crisis. Not all of us get infected by the virus but all of us are affected by the mental health impact of the pandemic.

       " {'text': 'covid 19 vaccinations singapore students pfizer biontech 14940000 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: When Secondary 4 student Salwa Taib Ali first heard about the COVID-19 vaccination exercise for students aged 12 and above, she immediately told her parents that she would like to sign up for it. “I was really excited because I would be able to play my part in ensuring that the COVID-19 situation in Singapore does not ... deteriorate,” she told CNA. The Ngee Ann Secondary School studentwas among the first students aged12 and aboveto receive a first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on Thursday (Jun 3). Bookings for vaccination slots opened on Tuesday. “I was also really happy, especially because I’m taking my O-Levels this year. I was pretty stressed out because I was really scared I would contract COVID-19, or any of my friends or peers would contract COVID-19,” said 15-year-old Salwa. “So when the vaccination (exercise) was announced, and students were allowed to take it, I was really excited and the first thing I did was to tell my parents to book me for the first slot available.” The Ministry of Education (MOE) announced on May 31 that more than 400,000 students would be progressively invited to register for vaccinationsfrom Jun 1, after the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was approved in May by the Health Sciences Authority for those aged 12 to 15 years. The invites were first sent out to students or parents of students in graduating cohorts from secondary schools and at pre-university levels, or students sitting for the GCE N-, O- or A-Level examinations later this year. In a Facebook post on Thursday evening, Education Minister Chan Chun Sing said more than9,000 students have \"booked appointments to receive the first dose of vaccination against COVID-19 today\". \"I am heartened by the positive response that we have received thus far, and the high sign-up rate. As we battle the evolving challenges from the pandemic, vaccination remains the best way to keep our students and children safe,\" he said, adding that eligible students will be notified via SMS invitations until Jun 13. Mr Chan also urged parents to sign their child up for vaccination when they receive the invite. Secondary 5 student Philicia Geow wasone of those who received an invite to register for vaccination. “Being in the graduating cohort this year, we’re doing our national exams soon, andbeing able to have the prioritythis timeinstead of having to get our vaccinations during our national examsis something that I’m pretty grateful for,” said Philicia. The CHIJ Katong Convent studenthas three siblings, two of whom are also in the age range to receive jabs as part of the vaccination exercise for students. Philicia will receive her first doseon Monday at a community centre near her home. “I’m looking forward to, hopefully, the restrictions getting more lenient ...I feel like this vaccination is a big milestone for not only our country but for the whole world as well,” she said. “I\\'m really looking forward to the entire world, or even just our country, being able to overcome this challenge of the pandemic, because I\\'m really looking forward to being able to just go out without wearing a mask and being able to meet people again.” \"REALLY FAST, PROMPT AND EASY\" Speaking to CNA hours after receiving her jab, Salwa said the injection went “way better than expected”, and that the process was “really fast, prompt and easy”. She didnot experienceany side effects shortly after the jab. Adding that she is looking forward to returning to school for face-to-face classes when more students are vaccinated, she said: “With the increasing number of people taking vaccines, I hope that (we can have) more face-to-face lessons, which will also help.” She also hopes to resume PE classes and other mass school activities, which had to be cancelled due to the rising number of COVID-19 community cases. “Many of these are things that my friends and I like to do together. So I hope that with the increased number of students and my friends taking the vaccine, I hope that we’ll be able to resume these activities once again.” Over the next two weeks, the remaining full-time students in schools and institutes of higher learning will receive invitations to register for vaccinations, said the Education Ministry. Theseincludeprivately-funded schools, madrasahs and special education schools, said MOE on May 31.Privately-funded schools comprise Anglo-Chinese School (International), StJoseph\\'s Institution International High School and Hwa Chong International School. Students who are enrolled in private education institutions, such asinternational schools, can register as part of the national vaccination exercise, which is separate from the one for students, said MOE in response to CNA queries. Children who are home schooled can also register as part of the national vaccination exercise. “If supplies continue to arrive as scheduled, the national vaccination exercise will be rolled out to the rest of the age-eligible population by mid-June 2021, starting with Singapore citizens,\" added the Education Ministry. Students below18 years old will only be offered the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, while those aged 18 and above can opt for either the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines. The interval between the first and second dose will be six to eight weeks. The Education Ministry said it has conducted two webinars to address parents’ concerns and queries about the safety of the vaccines. “Our schools will also work closely with parents to encourage students and their parents to sign-up for the vaccination. Parents should also consult their family doctors if they have questions pertaining to the suitability of the vaccination for their children,” the ministry added. Eligible students can get vaccinated at community vaccination centres. There will also be four dedicated MOE vaccination centres set up at Raffles City Convention Centre, ITE College Central, ITE College East and ITE College West, said MOE. Each ITE centre will have up to 1,600 vaccination slots per day, which is\"comparable\" to the number of slots atcommunity vaccination centres, while Raffles Convention Centre will have upto 2,000 slots per day, the ministry added. The vaccination exercise for students is expected to be completed by August, MOE said on May 31. Hearing that students her age would be able to register to get vaccinated was a “pleasant surprise”, said Secondary 4 student Julia Ho, adding that she had expected those in her age group to be among the last to get vaccinated. Seeing the increasing number of COVID-19 infections involvingstudentsover the past few weeks was “slightly worrying”, saidthe Nanyang Girls’ High School student. She will be getting her first dose of thevaccine on Monday. “The first thought that really came to me at that point in time was that if the majority of us in schools get vaccinated, then I think it would definitely create a much safer environment for all of us ...where we can learn in peace without having to worry asmuch about the virus spreading among us in schools,” she said. “I think it really brings this sense of hope that we can resume to what school was like two years ago – where we could have things such as mass assemblies, mass celebrations like Chinese New Year celebrations or Teachers’ Day in person as a school –which I think really adds that human touch to the school experience.” Downloadourappor subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

       " {'text': 'covid 19 pm lee phase 2 heightened alert jun 13 speech 14919830 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: Barring any super-spreader events or large clusters, Singapore “should be on track” to bringing itsCOVID-19 outbreak under control, said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Monday (May 31). In an address to the nation, Mr Lee added that if the number of community cases falls further, the country “should be” able to relax existing restrictions under the Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) period after Jun 13, the date that they are currently set to last until. His speech providing an update on the COVID-19 situation comes almost three weeks after Singapore introduced fresh restrictions on social gatherings and activities, following the emergence of several clusters of infections. “We will know for sure in another week or so. Meanwhile, I count on everyone to keep up our efforts and stay vigilant,” said Mr Lee.He alsoencouraged members of the public to go out only for essential purposes, and to see a doctor immediately if they feel unwell. SINGAPORE IN A BETTER POSITION TODAY Mr Lee said that the country is “in a much better position today”, compared to a year ago when it had its first big outbreak of infections. This is because it has built up testing and contact tracing capabilities, while its vaccination programme is also “well advanced”. But new variants have emerged, and will continue to do so, he said, and a more infectious virus means Singapore will have to “raise (its) game” to keep the pandemic under control. Specifically, Singapore will have to step up testing, contract tracing and vaccinations, he said. TESTING TO BECOME PART OF NEW NORMAL Firstly, testing must be done “faster, and more liberally and extensively”, Mr Lee said, adding that Singapore will be shifting its approach to testing. He explained that many different tests have become available, such as antigen rapid tests, saliva tests, breathalysers, and even Do-It-Yourself tests, available at pharmacies, that are coming on-stream. “These alternatives to PCR tests help us detect and isolate persons quickly when they are most infectious. This will be a big help in slowing down the spread of COVID-19,” he said. With tests becoming faster and cheaper, routine testing can be done at more workplaces, restaurants and shopping malls, and for individuals whose jobs involve coming into close contact with many people, such as educators and taxi drivers, he said. “Henceforth we will not only test to identify infections when a new case pops up. We will also routinely and regularly test people who appear well, in normal work or social or community settings, to make these places safe,” he said. This will provide confidence to resume larger-scale events. “Therefore, you should expect routine, large-scale, fast and simple testing to be part of our new normal,” he said. SPEEDING UP VACCINATIONS Good progress has been made with vaccinations since December, said Mr Lee, adding that vaccinations will be sped up further in the next two months, with first dose vaccinations as a priority. The country’s 40 vaccination centres island-wide are running smoothly, but the constraint is vaccine supply, he added. The good news is that since the last update by the multi-ministry task force against COVID-19, authorities have received confirmation of faster vaccine deliveries over the next two months, he said. These supplies mean the vaccine will be extended to everyone, even sooner than expected – with the next group being students. “In this latest outbreak, we have seen more cases of children getting infected, in schools and tuition centres. The children were not seriously ill, but parents are naturally worried. “Therefore, we will take advantage of the June holidays to vaccinate students,” he said. Bookings open on Tuesday, with priority given to graduating cohorts for O, N, and A-Levels, as well as special needs students. This will be followed by students aged 12 and above, including students in Institutes of Higher Learning. Finally, young adults 39 years and younger will be vaccinated. CONTACT TRACING Contact tracing will also be done more quickly and more widely, he said. Mr Lee said such operations have already vastly improved, owing to tools such as TraceTogether and SafeEntry, and Singaporeans’ “self-discipline, public spirit and support of (the tools)\". But the net for contact tracing will now be cast wider. “Our experience has shown that if a close contact is infected, he is quite likely to infect others who stay with him in the same household,” said Mr Lee. Therefore, when a close contact of an infected case is identified, that first-degree contact will be tested and isolated. But now, his or her household members will also be notified to isolate themselves immediately, without waiting to see whether that first-degree contact tests positive, said Mr Lee. “This more aggressive approach will help us to shut down clusters more quickly.” ENCOURAGING THE ELDERLY TO GET VACCINATED Mr Lee also made a “special pitch” to the elderly. Nearly three-quarters of the elderly – 760,000 senior citizens aged 60 and above – have had at least one jab or booked a slot already, but 280,000 have still not yet booked appointments, he said. He urged this group to come forward, adding that the process has been made more convenient for them. “If you are above 60, you can now walk into any vaccination centre, and get vaccinated on the spot. No need to register. No need to book in advance.” Those who are immobile can be jabbed during home visits by medical professionals. Today, nearly four in 10 residents have had at least one dose of the vaccine, but the next target is to get two-thirds of residents vaccinated with at least the first dose, said Mr Lee. This goal should be achieved by early July, if supplies come in as planned, he added. THE NEW NORMAL Painting a picture of the new normal, Mr Lee said he does not expect COVID-19 to disappear. “It will remain with humankind, and become endemic. The virus will continue to circulate in pockets of the global population for years to come.” This means small outbreaks of COVID-19 will occur in Singapore from time to time too, he said. “Our aim must be to keep the community as a whole safe, while accepting that some people may get infected every now and then. Just as we do with the common flu or dengue fever, which we now manage through public health measures and personal precautions,” Mr Lee said. Living with the COVID-19 virus also means not completely closing Singapore’s borders. “We will not be able to prevent some infected persons from slipping through from time to time. But as long as our population is mostly vaccinated, we should be able to trace, isolate, and treat the cases that pop up, and prevent a severe and disastrous outbreak,” he said.

       " {'text': 'e sports espl gaming growing industry covid 19 14946634 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: While many industries have taken a beating from the COVID-19 pandemic, e-sports is one of the few that are thriving as people seek various entertainment options while spending more time at home. E-sports Players League (ESPL), a Singapore-based e-sports tournament platform, said it has seen “very fast” growth in user numbers since launching at the start of last year. This bolstered its confidence to expand from four to 16 markets across Asia, Europe and America over the same period. “User activities kept growing,” said president and co-founder Lau Kin Wai. “At the peak from April to July, we saw the number of users doubling every month.” The user base in Singapore has jumped by 120 per cent since day one, he added, while the fastest-growing markets, such as India and Bangladesh, saw as much as 300 per cent growth. ESPL describes itself as an e-sports tournament and media platform which focuses on the amateurs, or grassroots gamers as it calls them. This segment of the gaming community is currently “very underserved” given how most competitions are catered for e-sports professionals, Mr Lau told CNA. “Just like any other sport, there is a group of people who are not playing the sport for a living but are serious about it. They want to up their game and want to know how they fare against friends or other people. That’s where we come in.” Around the world, there are other e-sports platforms that serve everyday gamers such as US-listed Super League Gaming which calls itself \"the amateur e-sports experience platform\". Founded in 2015, it runs tournaments and community-building events. ESPL said it is the only such platform in Singapore. Last year, it organised 312 online tournaments, serving more than half a million amateur gamers around the world. E-sports has already been gaining momentum over the past few years.According to games and e-sports research firm Newzoo, the global industry is set to see more than US$1 billion in revenue for 2021, up 14 per cent from last year. And the pandemic has given the industry a boost. Apart from seeking entertainment options, people are also looking tostay connected with others. “There’s also the social interaction factor,” said Mr Lau. “We find that a lot of people game partly because they want to interact with friends or other people. Especially if there’s a competition, you rally your friends towards a common goal and that’s very much a social interaction.” Still as a new business, ESPL\\'sexponential growth amid a global crisis came as a surprise. Said Mr Lau: “Like everyone, we were very unsure of how this will impact every single thing we do. We held back on all advertising and was hoping to hunker down, but our user base just kept growing. “Only around May or June that we realised that the pandemic is driving all things digital and we’d be one of those that will be growing still.” Apart from e-sports enthusiasts, ESPL said it has also captured the attention of other businesses keen on partnerships or taking up advertisements on its platform. Not just the usual gaming and technology-related brands, Mr Lau said there has been “fast-growing” demand from consumer brands, ranging from energy drinks, shampoo to deodorants. “With the digital consumer behaviour being accelerated by a good five years, every single brand in the world is shifting a lot of focus to engaging consumers online. Our users are usually between 21 and35 years old and they are the prime targets for most of these consumer brands,” he explained. MORE THAN A PANDEMIC-DRIVEN TREND ESPL plans to hold more than 700 tournaments this year, more than double what it had in 2020. It believes that it can continue to grow, even beyond the pandemic. “It doesn\\'t mean that once the pandemic is over, people will go non-digital. The behaviour has changed,” said Mr Lau. “Likewise with our platform, if you know that this is something that allows you to interact with friends on a Friday night, it will remain an option even when the time comes for us to be able to spend more time outside.” The platform also aims to have a wide variety of games beyond the classic first-person shooter titles. In addition, it will soon allow gamers on its platform to organise their own tournaments for free. This is in response to the requests it has received from users, said Mr Lau. ESPL is also betting on collaborations with new investors. It recently raised nearly S$3 million, marking its biggest funding round which included “strategic investors” such as Genting Ventures, the corporate venture arm of the Genting Group, and Warner Music Asia. With the latter, the e-sports online platform is looking at “crossover initiatives between music and gaming”, said Mr Lau. “A lot of gamers are plugged into music when they game and that adrenaline rush is definitely enhanced with the right music,” he added, noting that the record label will become the exclusive music partner of ESPL. The platform could also start hosting virtual concerts within its games, said Mr Lau, referring to an emerging trend in other parts of the world. “We could do a lot of this potentially with Warner Music to create new media between music and gaming,” he said.

When CNA visited Wee Healthfirst Medical Clinic in Clementi- one of the 24 approved clinics - at about 2.30pm on Thursday,at least 15people were there to ask about the Sinovac vaccine. Staff members were seen handing out paper slips for people to leave their details so that the clinic could contact them once the shots were available. Nearly 1,000 names were given to the clinic, according to the clinic’s director Dr Seow Yu Jin. \"It\\'s just been manic, it\\'s been verybusy ...Some patients, unfortunately, couldn\\'t get through on the phone and had to personallycome down and there was a long queue outside of the clinic, which I really wasn\\'t expecting,\" said Dr Seow. He saidthe clinic is currently waiting for its first batch of Sinovac shots to arrive. \"Hopefully they (the vaccine shots)willcome tomorrow.We\\'re bedding downprocesses –tonight, I\\'m just going tofinalisemy patient leafletsand then hopefully start vaccinating by the weekend,\" he said. He added that the clinic plans to open outside its usual operating hours in order to administer the vaccine. \"For example, this weekend, my Saturday clinicwill run from 8am to 1pm.In order todeal with this response, we will probably have to open after 1pm until about 5pm, 6pm, when we can just purely vaccinate, just get through the numbers,\" he said. It was a similar situation at StarMed Specialist Centre, an ambulatory surgery centre in Farrer Park, which hasseen an “overwhelming” response since its phone lines opened at 8am on Thursday. “We\\'ve already had (more than)400 bookings for vaccinations,” the centre’s chief executive officer Dr Louis Tan told CNA. \"It\\'s fair to say that wehave seen a larger number of patients who are above the age of 40 make enquiries as to thesevaccinations,\" he added. The centre hasplaced an order of 1,000 doses of the Sinovac vaccine, which was the maximum amount it was allowed, according to Dr Tan. It will be receiving 200 doses, with the firstbatch expected on Friday. To cope with the demand, the centre intends to bring in more nurses to support its current staff members,he said. At the moment, the centredoes not plan to extend its operating hours, but it will do soif necessary, said Dr Tan. When CNA tried calling the other clinics on the approved list between 3pm and 5pm, most of the phone lines were busy. Two of them who picked up - iCare Medical and Wellness Clinic, and Chinatown Wellness - told CNA that they were “swamped” with enquiries from the public, but did not give figures. Meanwhile, Pinnacle Family Clinic’s Pasir Ris branch told CNA it has received more than200 enquiries over the phone about the vaccine. StarMed Specialist Centre, which was involved in the vaccination of migrant workers and provided medical support at various community care facilities, said it will apply the same safety precautions when administering the Sinovac jabs. \"(We willscreen)patients for recent illness,fever ...possibility of pregnancy and so forth, as well as filtering them by age, these are all standard questions that we would ask patients before we administerthe vaccine,\" said Dr Tan. He added that the centre waswaiting for more guidelines from MOH. MOH reiterated on Wednesday that the Sinovac vaccine is not part of the nationalvaccine programme and those taking the Sinovac jabs will not be covered under the Vaccine Injury Financial Assistance Programme for COVID-19 Vaccination. The ministry added that those who wishto receive the vaccine through theSpecial Access Route should discuss the risks and benefits with their doctors at theirselected private healthcare institutions.

According to data released by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) on Tuesday (Jun 15), developers sold 891 units private residential units in May, excluding executive condominiums. This represents a 29.7 per cent decline in sales compared to April this year, although it was still about 83 per cent higher than in May last year, when Singapore was in its \"circuit breaker\" period. The Outside Central Region led new home sales in May, with 401 units sold, followed by the Rest of Central Region with 299 units sold and the Core Central Region with 191 units sold, URA data showed. The fall in sales comes amid the Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) measures, which started on May 16 to curb the spread of COVID-19. Viewings were restricted during this period. \"In response to a resurgence of virus infections, stricter measures were imposed on property sales galleries and house viewings, such as having no more than two persons per group (including salesperson) for property viewings,\" said Ms Christine Sun, senior vice-president of research andanalytics at OrangeTee & Tie. \"However, the drop in sales volume was not as drastic as a year earlier during the circuit breakerperiod,\" she added. \"The difference in sales before and after Heightened Alert is not significant. The industry is more prepared for disruption and the usage of virtual viewings might have helped to mitigate the drop in sales,\"saidHuttons Asia\\'s CEO Mark Yip. The firm believes that sales in May would have been \"much higher\" if there were no restrictions on showflat viewings, Mr Yip added. Sales performance was stronger this year as the property sector \"seems to be more prepared to ensure business continuity\" amid the tightened measures, said Ms Sun, adding that many developers and sales agents were able to switch to remote viewings quickly. The top five projects which saw the most units sold in May were One Bernam, with 83 units sold, followed by Treasure at Tampines, Normanton Park, Midwood and Affinity at Serangoon. Ten unitswere sold for at least S$10 million each in May, said Ms Sun. The priciest unit was a 548 sqm 20th floor apartment at Park Nova that sold for S$34.4 million. OUTLOOK AS PHASE 3 (HEIGHTENED ALERT) KICKS IN As COVID-19restrictions ease, with Singapore now in Phase 3 (Heightened Alert), experts saidsales could pick up again. \"There is potential for sales in June to match May’s numbers as the relaxed COVID-19 measures of up to fivein a group may see pent-up demand translate into actual sales,\" said Mr Yip, adding that he expects July to be a \"very busy month, with several launches lined up\". Ms Sun said new home sales may pick up again as restrictions are further eased. \"With many HDB owners selling their flats in recent months, we may also expect upgrader demand to remain strong, which will likely boost ... the new sales market,\" she added.

       " {'text': 'vaccine efficacy effectiveness meaning pfizer sinovac moderna 14978556 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners High vaccination uptake is key to easing COVID-19 restrictions, but a majority of polled respondents misunderstand how much protection vaccines provide, say Clarence Tam, Hannah Clapham and Yung Chee Fu. SINGAPORE: Eighteen months into the pandemic,we have multiple COVID-19 vaccines available. This is cause for great optimism. Scientific trials have shown that several have efficacies well above the minimum 50 per cent required by the World Health Organization (WHO). Some, like the mRNA vaccines used in Singapore, have efficacies above 90 per cent. The amount of information on these vaccines, however, is also a source of confusion. Studies show that, given the choice, people prefer vaccines with a higher vaccine efficacy number and fewer side effects.Media reports interpreting the latest findings from vaccine studies have understandably led the public to compare which vaccines are safer and which offer better protection. Unfortunately, the scientific community has not communicated clearly what vaccine efficacy means. Therefore, there is misunderstanding about how much protection different vaccines provide and their implications for people deciding whether to get vaccinated. To get an insight on how the public interprets vaccine efficacy, we polled Facebook users in Singapore to see what they thought vaccine efficacy meant. Only a quarter of users identified the accurate interpretation – if vaccine efficacy is 95 per cent, your chances of getting COVID-19 will be 95 per cent lower if you are vaccinated than if you are not. Instead, most people are under the impression that if you get vaccinated, you still have a 5 per cent chance of getting COVID-19. This suggests that many people have an inflated sense of their risk of COVID-19 if they get vaccinated, and this could undermine confidence in how much benefit these vaccines provide. This misinterpretation is understandable – what most people want to know is how likely they are to get COVID-19 if they get vaccinated. But this is not exactly what vaccine efficacy measures. Your chances of getting COVID-19 depend not just on how good the vaccine is, but also on how much virus is circulating in the population and other factors that affect your risk of COVID-19. These factors include your age, if you have underlying medical conditions, if you work in a high-risk job, how much social interaction you have and your mask-wearing and hand hygiene practices. Vaccine trials do not generally account for all of these social and lifestyle factors, so they provide limited information about your individual risk of contracting COVID-19. It looks like the email address you entered is not valid. WHAT VACCINE EFFICACY MEANS We can illustrate the idea of vaccine efficacy with an example from a scientific trial of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, currently used in Singapore. In that trial, around 36,000 people were randomly split into two groups. Half received two doses of the vaccine, while the other half got two doses of an identical-looking but inactive placebo injection. Everyone was then observed for about six weeks to see who developed COVID-19. In the 18,000-strong control group who received the placebo injection, there were 169 symptomatic COVID-19 cases over the six weeks. This equates to a risk of getting COVID-19 of about 90 cases for every 10,000 unvaccinated people for this period. In contrast, in the 18,000 vaccinated individuals, there were only eight symptomatic COVID-19 cases, or about four cases for every 10,000 vaccinated people. This means that among vaccinated people, the chances of getting symptomatic COVID-19 were about 20 times lower, or 5 per cent of the risk compared to people who got the placebo injection. Consequently, the vaccine has an efficacy of 95 per cent, because in vaccinated people it reduces the risk of getting symptomatic COVID-19 by 95 per cent compared to unvaccinated people. But it does not mean that 5 per cent of those who got the vaccine went on to get COVID-19. To date, the risk of getting COVID-19 in Singapore has been very low. Over 2020, before vaccination began, there were about 2,400 community cases in a population of around 5.4million people living in the community. So for a resident in Singapore, the chances of getting COVID-19 in 2020 were about 1 in 2,250. Had the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines been available then, getting vaccinated would have reduced this risk by about 20 times, to around one in every 50,000 vaccinated individuals. Recent increases in community cases mean your risk of getting COVID-19 is currently somewhat higher, but getting vaccinated will still drastically reduce your chances of getting COVID-19. COMPARING EFFICACIES ACROSS VACCINES CHALLENGING There has been much interest in which vaccines have better efficacy. Yet, comparing efficacy numbers for different vaccines is not straightforward. Trials of different vaccines were done in different countries with varying levels of virus transmission, at different time points in the epidemic and with different virus variants circulating. The trials were also done with different groups of volunteers – some included older adults, while others included mostly younger people who tend to have milder illness. And different trials diagnosed COVID-19 in slightly different ways. All these influence the estimated efficacy. It is also important to note that headline vaccine efficacy numbers indicate the level of protection against any symptomatic COVID-19 disease. For the majority of individuals, COVID-19 is relatively mild, so it is more important to know how well these vaccines protect against severe disease. The evidence so far is that most of the vaccines available are highly effective for preventing COVID-19 hospitalisation and death, even if some vaccines provide better protection against milder disease. UNDERSTANDING THE USE OF ALTERNATIVE VACCINES It is important to interpret vaccine efficacy figures in relation to how much virus transmission is currently happening. The current low levels of transmission put Singapore in an advantageous position. With rapid scaling up of vaccination, we can drastically reduce the COVID-19 risk in the population and maintain it at a low level even as we ease other social distancing measures. But for this to work, we need a very high uptake of vaccination in the population. Recent surveys in March suggest that a third of adults are unwilling or still unsure about whether to get vaccinated. So there is still work to do to communicate the benefits of vaccination, address public concerns and reduce hesitation. The Singapore Government is also taking other steps to improve the vaccination take-up rates. They recently announced that the second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, usually given within three to four weeks, would be delayed to six to eight weeks. This will allow more people to receive their first dose earlier. Alternatives to mRNA vaccines will also be made available through the special access route. This will provide vaccination options for people who cannot receive the mRNA vaccines, including those with severe allergies. With more options available, people may wonder if it is prudent to mix and match vaccines, for example, because of a belief that taking two different vaccines gives better protection, or because of an unpleasant reaction to the first dose of a mRNA vaccine. It is not recommended to mix and match vaccines unless medically advised, because we currently do not have any information on how much protection this would provide. Different vaccines are designed and tested using specific dosing schedules and regimens. Doses of alternative vaccines, such as Sinovac, will be limited and it is important that we reserve these for those who need them for medical reasons. (Are COVID-19 vaccines still effective against new variants? And could these increase the risk of reinfection? Experts explain why COVID-19 could become a “chronic problem\" on CNA\\'s Heart of the Matter podcast.) QUESTIONS REGARDING VACCINATION TO BE TACKLED The science of COVID-19 vaccines is indeed evolving constantly as we accumulate more information from large-scale vaccination programmes and the emergence of new variants. For example, it is too early to know how much protection these vaccines will provide against more recent variants, such as the Delta (B16172) variant currently causing global concern, or how long vaccine protection will last. But vaccination remains overwhelmingly the best way to reduce your individual risk of COVID-19. It is also currently the only viable way to navigate a safe relaxation of control measures while minimising the risk of large epidemics. This is not to say that vaccination will drive out the virus completely. As we open up our borders and ease restrictions, we need to accept that the risk of introducing the virus into the community will increase and cases will continue to occur. Having a large fraction of the population vaccinated will vastly improve our chances of managing these clusters without spiralling epidemics overrunning our healthcare facilities, and without having to implement repeated lockdowns.

       " {'text': \"changi airport singapore borders travellers closed suspension 14966062 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners A handful of netizens have been calling for the aviation hub to close its doors to the world after a COVID-19 cluster there but IPS’ Faizal Yahya says be careful what you ask for. SINGAPORE: The recent wave of infections in Singapore, which included a COVID-19 cluster at Changi Airport last month, has prompted some calls for the suspension of passenger travel at the airport altogether. While many have called for an earliertightening of restrictions of travel fromcertain places with surges in infections,which are reasonable, worryingly, there are some who have commented that Changi should also have been closed to inbound travelers to protect Singapore from bringing in COVID-19 cases into the country. “Can’t they just close the border for 14 days?” asked one. “How about a complete ban” asked another. While suchcalls are few and far between, they are alarming, do not understand the gravity of shutting off travel and shouldbe addressed. Even if a pause for 14 days eliminates imported cases completely, the risk remains after Changi reopens. Without a clear end in sight for this pandemic, staying shut until COVID-19 is brought to heel is not a viable option. CRIPPLING CHANGI’S RECOVERY Currently, due to COVID-19 restrictions on global travel, Changi only recorded 11.8 million passengers in 2020, a 82.8 per cent decrease compared to the 68.3 million in 2019. Even though total passenger movement totalled 173,000 in April 2021, which is much higher than the low base of 25,200 a year ago when Singapore had a circuit breaker, Changi’s numbers have slowed to a trickle, at less than 5 per cent of pre-COVID traffic. These have not factored in new travel restrictions imposed after a new wave of infections hit Singapore. Airlines and airport leaders have already started adjusting to this reality of a collapse in air travel. The reduction in air travel has prompted major policy shifts such as the shelving of development for Terminal 5 for at least two years as air travel trends are analysed. Singapore Airlines has also undertaken a major restructuring exercise. COMPETITION IS RIFE Even though international travel has been muted during COVID-19, Changi Airport's competitors have fared better, sustained by domestic traffic which make up almost 90 per cent of air travel in a pandemic year. It looks like the email address you entered is not valid. For 2020, the 11.8 million passengers that came through Changi were far fewerthan the 43 million and 72.6 million respectively at Malaysian and Thai airports. While Bangkok’s Suvarnabhumi and Don Mueang airports saw a 53 per cent dip in passengers over FY2020, they had a respectable 648,000 people coming through in September 2020, according to the Airports of Thailand. Out of these, 588,00 were domestic travel passengers. Airports of Thailand also predicts that it should hit almost 80 per cent of 2019 passenger volume by the next fiscal year. These regional airports have already given Changi a run for its money in attracting budget travellers pre-coronavirus, with Don Mueang’s emergence as the world’s largest low-cost air hub with multiple low-cost carriers (LCC) plying routes since 2015 and Malaysia building a low-cost carrier terminal at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) in 2014. Further afield, the Gulf states with their airports in Abu Dhabi, Doha and Dubai are also gaining ground. Pre-coronavirus, airline seat count doubled in the Middle East between 2009 to 2018 to 264.3 million scheduled passengers departing from the region. As at end-2020, Dubai welcomed 25.9 million people through its terminals, a third of the 86.4 million that passed in 2019. “The Middle East sits in a unique position in dealing with the consequences of the pandemic and the airline losses from it”, Oliver Wyman Transportation and Services partner Michael Wette was quoted in an industry report as saying. “Mostly state-owned operators are somewhat protected from the short-term financial hit, given that the government will likely provide financial support.” With sufficient oil and natural resources to cushion the blow, the Airports Council International forecasted on Feb 1 that over the next 20 years, total passenger traffic will grow at 5.2 per cent in the Middle East compared to 4.7 per cent in the Asia Pacific, with Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates leading the way. THE IMPACT OF SCALING BACK ON AIR TRAVEL With the aviation sector contributing 3 per cent to Singapore’s GDP and as many as 119,000 jobs, scaling back on passenger air travel is a risk the country can ill afford. Travel bans to certain countries based on medical advice might have been necessary but has larger implications beyond the immediate drop in travel. It is Changi’s excellent connectivity - based on its more than 400 flight destinations, flight frequency of an airplane arriving or departing from Changi every 80 seconds and the availability of more than 100 airlines that Changi serves – that makes Singapore a key aviation hub. Maintaining long-haul connections with Europe and North America during the pandemic is necessary to sustain Changi’s air hub role in the region. Airlines that find new routes to bypass Changi for transit may find these alternatives eventually more attractive and may not return. A long-term suspension of passenger travel at Changi, the de facto home of SIA, will inevitably harm the airline’s recovery and the fortunes of its more than 28,000 employees across the group. In addition, it will also hurt Singapore’s S$6.8 billion logistics sector, which hires more than 86,000 employees. In the 2018 to 2019 period, Changi served 24 cargo airlines operating over 320 weekly scheduled freighter flights, linking Singapore to 48 cities. Passenger flights also carried freight in their under bellies. Air connectivity is also critical to Singapore’s growth sectors like the pharmaceutical industry and e-commerce where portals here provide over 20,000 items from more than 800 brands. KEEP CALM AND INCREASE PRESENCE The cases of COVID–19 infections in Singapore and our key trading partners may continue to oscillate. That is why instead of halting passenger flows, Changi has taken steps to improve public health safety through segregating workers into risk-based zones and passengers from places of different risk profiles among other measures. Instead of knee-jerk reactions, the CAG must maintain visibility in key markets such as China and Indonesia through publicity and promotions so that it is well-placed to take advantage of the recovery once travel restrictions ease and vaccination rates go up. For example, Changi has collaborated with Chinese mobile payment partners Alipay, WeChat Pay and UnionPay to launch quarterly shopping promotions targeting Chinese passengers. As a key air hub in the region and within a key growth area for air traffic, Changi’s air connectivity should never be undermined because the loss of market share might not be regained. No doubt steps must be taken to protect public safety. This is where responsivetravel restrictions onhigh-risk destinationsis needed when cases in other parts of the world spike. But closure to passenger travel should not be an immediate option.

       " {'text': 'e bike numbers double singapore demand food delivery riders 15067674 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: The number of electric bicycles in Singapore has soared over the past year, buoyed by increased demand from food delivery services amid the COVID-19 pandemic. There were31,660 registered electric bicycles - or e-bikes or power-assisted bicycles (PABs) -as of the end of May,according to figures provided by the Land Transport Authority (LTA). That is twicethe figure of 15,800 registered e-bikes in May last year. Since it was made mandatory in 2018 for e-bikes to be registered before they can be used on roads and cycling paths, their numbers have hovered at around 13,000. But more people turned to e-bikes after the ban on the use of e-scooters and other personal mobility devices (PMDs) on footpaths in November 2019. E-scooter numbers tumbled from about 100,000 in 2019 to just 6,671 registered devices as of the end of May this year - a 93 per cent drop. “These e-scooters have been declared by registered owners to be UL2272-certified, or have undergone inspections by LTA,” said a spokesperson from the agency,referring to a mandatory fire safety certification for PMDs here. E-bikes sold in Singapore must meet the requirement that a cyclist pedals before the motor kicks in, and it cannot have a throttle thatallows them to move without pedalling. This is unlike e-scooters, which generally do not have such pedals. DEMAND FROM FOOD DELIVERY RIDERS Retailers attributed the rise in demand for e-bikes to the increasing popularity of food delivery services following the outbreak of COVID-19, with delivery riders making up the bulk of their customers. “Sales of PABs have been rising due to COVID-19 as more people are ordering food online, the demand for delivery riders has gone up and hence (there has been a) direct increase in sales of PABs,” said Mr Jay Jin, general manager for Kernel Singapore. Kernel is one of several companies thathave pivoted from selling PMDs to selling bicycles and e-bikes following the footpath ban in 2019. “We expect the sales of e-bikes to continue to increase as the demand for food deliveries continues to boom,” said Mr Jin. Mr Chew Boon Hur, the general manager for Mobot, another e-bike retailer, said food delivery riders make up about 80 per cent of e-bike customers. Of the major food delivery services here, foodpanda said about a third of its delivery riders use e-bikes, adding that it had seen an increase in the number of riders on e-bikes since last year’s COVID-19 “circuit breaker”. Deliveroo said it has a fleet of about 9,000 riders, but declined to reveal how many use e-bikes. Although food delivery riders make up the bulk of those using e-bikes, an increasing number of avid cyclists are turning to such devices,Mobot’s Mr Chew noted. As such, Mobot has started selling two new models for such cyclists, who make up about 20 per cent of its customers, he said. Mr Chew noted thate-bike sales have been going up across the world as well. According to market research firm NPD, e-bike sales increased 145 per cent between 2019 and 2020 in the United States alone. In Singapore, however, regulations such as restrictions on the weight and speed of e-bikes have limited what models can be sold here and hampered the growth of e-bikes, Mr Chew said. RISE IN ACCIDENTS The spike in Singapore’s e-bike population has been accompanied by a rise in the number of traffic accidents involving the two-wheelers. Figures provided by the Traffic Police showed that the number of accidents involving e-bikes rose from 24 in 2019 to 75 in 2020 - a threefold increase. Of the 75 accidents last year, three were fatal. There were no fatal accidents involving e-bikes in 2019. Food delivery companies CNA contacted did not say if any of the accidents involved their riders, although they stressed thatthe safety of their riders is a priority. “The safety of our riders is a top priority for us, and we regularly remind our riders to comply with traffic regulations. Riders who are caught riding dangerously or breaking traffic rules will face penalties, including potential blacklist,” said a foodpanda spokesperson. “At Deliveroo, we don’t impose time limits on riders to complete their deliveries, or provide incentives for fast deliveries, as our priority is safe delivery,\" said a spokesperson from the company.\"Our aim is to deliver food to customers’ doorsteps as efficiently as possible, but never compromising the safety of our riders, pedestrians and other road users.\" Grab meanwhile pointed to a new training programme focused on thefood delivery sector that it is introducing next month. “New Grab delivery-partners would be required to complete the course within two months of activating their Grab account, with the module being tailored based on the partners\\' mode of food delivery,” said a Grab spokesperson. THEORY TESTS From Jun 30, it will be mandatory for e-bike and e-scooter riders to pass an online theory test, which will quiz riders on their understanding of the rules and safe riding practices. Thiscould potentially help reduce the number of accidents, saidMr Saktiandi Supaat, who chairs the Government Parliamentary Committee for Transport. “I hope as LTA builds more of the cycling paths and dedicated lanes and pedestrians, we could also see reduced accidents,” Mr Saktiandi added. Urban transport expertPark Byung Joon from theSingapore University of Social Sciences is sceptical about the impact of theory tests. “I doubt theory tests will be effective. How many drivers signal when they change lanes? They took theory tests too,” said Associate Professor Park. He believes greater investment in measures such as surveillance equipment and manpower for enforcement purposes will be able to play a greater role in reducing accidents. Retailers are hopeful the e-bikeboom will not lead it to the same fate as the e-scooter. “Personally, I do not think so,” said Mr Chew, adding most riders are law-abiding. Kernel’s Mr Jin said he is confident the steps taken by LTA would help to keep roads safe for both riders and motorists. “We will also do our part to advocate safe riding as a retailer,” he added. Apart from the food delivery riders, Mr Chew believes that the popularity of e-bikes will continue to rise among cyclists, as conventional bicycle manufacturers such as Trek and Cannondale have begun releasing their own e-bike models. “In the past, cyclists used to have the perception that e-bike riders are not real cyclists, they are lazy and have an unfair advantage,” said Mr Chew, noting that there has since been a mindset shift. “Cyclists are now viewing e-bikes as another bicycle they can add to their arsenal.” It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

       " {'text': 'covid cluster mindsville napiri adult care home challenge 14946852 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the virus has found its way intoadult care homes in countries around the world, and Singaporeis no exception. One of the latest local clusters – at MINDSville@Napiri, a home for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities – has grown to 27 cases in a matter of days. Four cases are staff members and 23 are residents. This is not the first time Singapore has seen an outbreak in an adult care home. Last year, cases were found in nursing homes such as the Lee Ah Mooi Old Age Home and Orange Valley Nursing Home, leading to mass-testing for thousands of residents and employees across the island. It is critical to keep COVID-19 out of care homes for the elderly and disabled, saidProfessor Dale Fisher, whochairs the World Health Organization’s Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network. This is becausetheyoften house people who are “vulnerable to severe disease and death” – meaning the outcomes of infections are “much poorer”, he added. But itisparticularly challenging to keep these facilities COVID-free,mainly because of the need for close contact between residents and staff members, said experts CNA spoke to. CHALLENGES OF KEEPING HOMES COVID-FREE Prof Fisher explained that there is a lot of contact between the resident and others, such asnurses, allied health staff, cleaners, auxiliary staff membersand visitors. \"So one person, perhaps asymptomatic, can spread it to many residents and residents can spread it to staff. The more people, the more contact of each individual– the greater the risk of spread.\" An adult disability home may be even more vulnerable to an outbreak if there is “more intensive support” with more activities and contact, said Prof Fisher, who is also a senior infectious diseases consultant at the National University Hospital. Butreducing this human contact is tricky because it plays a key role in managing resident’s behaviours, said Mr Ardi S Hardjoe, the chief executive at Thye Hua Kwan Nursing Home. The Thye Hua Kwan group also runs several homes for the disabled. Mr Ardi noted that contact, activities and interaction help fightagainst boredom, isolation and despair – which are potential consequences that must be avoided in institutional living. “If we don\\'t keep the residents fully engaged, and if they\\'re bored and doing nothing every single day … that will trigger them to display behaviours,” Mr Ardi added. Professor Paul Tambyah, president of the Asia Pacific Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infection suggested that another challenge in adult care facilities may be that “many individuals may not understand basic hygiene concepts”. In addition, he said many of these facilities are short-staffed, making it hard for staff to practice “full proper hygiene” in between handling clients. On top of that, many residents may not be able to recognise symptoms of infections, especially if they are subtle – such as a loss of smell or taste, he noted. Another challenge he put forth was that there are many different vendors, service providers, and volunteers going in and out of these homes, and it may be difficult to screen all of them or ensure all of them have been completely vaccinated. THE MINDSVILLE@NAPIRI CLUSTER Specifically, Prof Tambyah pointed out that it is not the first time thatMINDSville@Napiri has seen an outbreak. In July 2019, the care home was the site of a measles cluster. But he said that this outbreak of COVID-19 cases was picked up “relatively quickly”, with most cases being asymptomatic. The Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) had said that of the 27 cases, 23 were asymptomatic and discovered through proactive testing. “This may also have been a result of a good vaccination program,” he said. According to MSF, about 91 per cent of the home’s staff and residents were inoculated during vaccination exercises conducted in February and March. Since the cases were detected, the home\\'s operator, Minds, said it has disinfected thepremisesand completed swab tests for all 255 residents and staff. It has also banned visitors and stopped admitting or discharging residents. It also said that it has implemented safe management measures stipulated by authorities since the start of the pandemic – including limiting interactions, having split zones and conducting daily temperature-taking. All residents have had their outings and home leave suspended since May 7, but they have been allowed to keep their external medical appointments, said the home’s operator, Minds. All live-in staff have also not been allowed to leave since then, except for essential purposes, it said. THE NEED TO BE MINDFUL Inthe meantime, Thye Hua Kwan’s Mr Ardi said the cluster at MINDSville@Napiri has made his team“a lot more mindful” about hygiene and safety rules. “We do reiterate that we have to minimise direct human contact from the visitor screening, have safe distancing measures, split teams, split zones for employees.” They have also “done their best” to make working from home a default, Mr Ardi said. “But for running institutions and homes, it could be quite difficult, as we need the clinical team to be present … so this is something that we\\'re juggling with,” he said. Mr Ardi added that if any cases are to be detected in their facilities, a 10-step safety protocol is in place. HOW TO PREVENT FUTURE OUTBREAKS As for what more can be done to prevent future outbreaks in adult care homes, experts say vaccination is key. Prof Fisher noted: “If an outbreak occurs but no one gets sick because the vaccine makes the disease mild, then there is no problem. “Until we are all vaccinated, we must really limit contacts – for example, minimise activities and visitors, (and so on).” Prof Tambyah added that vaccinations must cover not just staff and residents, but also vendors and visitors to the homes.

       " {'text': 'airlines singapore negative covid19 test ica 14919492 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: Airlines will be responsible for ensuring that returning Singapore citizens and permanent residents (PRs) have a valid negative COVID-19 test, said the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS). All airlines flying into Changi Airport have been informed of the new requirement, said CAAS airport operations regulation and aviation security director Margaret Tan, responding to queries from CNA. Airlines must check that all passengers - including returning Singapore citizens and PRs - have a valid negative Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test result certificate before allowing them to board a flight to Singapore, said Ms Tan. These certificates should be issued by an internationally accredited or recognised laboratory, clinic or medical facility specified by Singapore’s Ministry of Health, she added. \"Airlines must not allow a passenger to board the flight to Singapore if that passenger fails to produce the result of the required PCR test or if the result of that PCR test is positive. They will be responsible to carry a person who is denied entry into Singapore back to the point of departure,” she said. This comes after the Ministry of Health announced last week that Singaporeans and PRs are now required to present a valid negative COVID-19 PCR test taken within 72 hours before departing for Singapore. Excluded are those who have stayed in lower-risk countries and regions - comprising Australia, Brunei, mainland China, New Zealand, Hong Kong and Macau - in the last 21 days before departure to Singapore. Previously only long-term pass holders and short-term pass visitors entering Singapore were required to present a valid negative COVID-19 PCR test. Those who arrive in Singapore without a valid negative test result may be denied entry, MOH said, adding that PRs and long-term pass holders who fail to comply may also have their permit or pass cancelled. According to the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority\\'s (ICA) SafeTravel website, those travelling by plane or by boat will have to present their test result at the air and sea checkpoints upon arrival in Singapore. Singapore Airlines (SIA) said passengers will be required to show its service agents a valid negative COVID-19 PCR test certificate. “This test must have been taken within 72 hours of their first point of embarkation,” said a spokesperson for the national carrier. “Passengers who are unable to produce a valid certificate will not be permitted to board the flight.” However, those who are unable to get COVID-19 tests in time will be allowed to book another flight on SIA without incurring further penalties. “Complimentary rebooking is available for passengers who are unable to meet the requirements in time, subject to seat availability,” said the SIA spokesperson. COULD A SINGAPORE CITIZEN BE BARRED FROM ENTRY? While the onus is on people to ensure they have the necessary negative test and airlines to make sure no-one boards a flight to Singapore without one, it is unclear what would happen if a citizen arrived without thatnecessary documentation. In response to questions on this issue, ICA directed CNA to a page on its website on requirements for citizens and PRs travelling to Singapore, which highlights the need for the negative test.However,Singapore Management University associate professor of law Eugene Tan said that ifa citizen didarrive at a Singapore immigration without the requisite negative test,there may be no legal basis for ICA to deny the citizen entryso long as the person has valid travel documents. If a Singapore citizen were to be rejected entry into the country on the basis of not possessing a negative COVID-19 test, a “legitimate argument” could be made that the individual’s rights under Article 13(1) of the Singapore Constitution - which states that no Singapore citizen shall be \"banished or excluded\" from the country- had been breached, said Assoc Prof Tan. He noted that it is more likely that a Singaporean without the requisite negative COVID-19 test would not be able to board the aircraft or sea vessel in the first place. “Therefore, the situation of the citizen being excluded from Singapore does not arise in such a situation,” he said. Assoc Prof Tan believes it is a “moot legal question” as to whether a pre-departure COVID-19 test is “so unreasonable or unlawful such that it effectively restricts and derogates\" from a citizen\\'s constitutionalright. “In my view, no, given the global pandemic and the need to protect passengers travelling to Singapore and the public health imperative to keep people in Singapore safe,” he said.

       " {'text': 'cp foods singapore stops imports from thai factory covid 19 14920940 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: Charoen Pokphand (CP) Foods Singapore said on Monday (May 31) it has stopped importing food products from its Saraburi factory in Thailand, after reports of a COVID-19 outbreak among employees working there. The company also assured consumers that the items currently for sale in Singapore have been cleared for consumption. “Before they can be distributed to retailers or made available for online sale to the public, CP Foods’ products need to undergo a clearance process conducted by the Singapore Food Agency,” it said. The company also noted that theWorld Health Organization and the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) have said there is a low likelihood of people contracting COVID-19 from food or food packaging. “Customers can rest assured that the items that they have bought, and the current products carried by all the retailers, are safe for consumption,\" said CP Foods Singapore. In response to CNA\\'s queries, theSFAsaid on Tuesday that Singapore imports processed chicken products from the \"affected establishment in Thailand\\'s Saraburi province\". These imports account for less than 1 per cent of Singapore\\'s total chicken imports last year, it added. \"Current state of knowledge across scientific communities and public health authorities worldwide is that the COVID-19 virus is not transmitted to humans via food. COVID-19 is a respiratory illness and is transmitted human-to-human via respiratory droplets and contact,\" said SFA. \"Contact with food or food packaging is no different from contact with other non-food packaging and the environment,\" it added. \"An infected person can contaminate the food or food packaging but the risk of infections of COVID-19 due to contact with contaminated surfaces of food and food packaging is very low and can be further reduced through good public and personal hygiene practices.\" FACTORY TAKES MEASURES AFTER OUTBREAK The Saraburi factory is one of the 19 poultry processing factories that CP Foods Singapore imports its stocks from. On Sunday, it was reported that the Saraburi factory in Bangkok has beenclosed after 245 workers tested positive for COVID-19. Following the outbreak, CP Foods said it immediately closed the areas where those who had tested positive worked. These areas will remain closed for five days, it said in a statement on Monday. Efforts have been made to get the affected areas cleaned and disinfectedin line with health measures to ensure no contamination takes place in the workplace. “A lab test will be required to confirm that the areas are disease-free,” it said, adding that only workers who have tested negative for COVID-19 will be allowed to return to work. The remaining 18 plants in Thailand will remain operational with measures in place. These includerequiring workers to change uniforms, wearing masks which fully cover their mouths and noses and following social distancing measures. The company said it has also conducted regular random testing for COVID-19 on its chicken products and no contamination has been reported. All employees are also being tested for COVID-19, CP Foods said. “Employees in high-risk groups are put under state quarantine for 14 days, while those in low-risk groups are required to place themselves under self-quarantine for the same period,” it added. The company said it has also provided a “seal and bubble” area for workers who are not infected and relocated chicken production to other plants to prevent disruptions to business and customers.

Mandatory swab tests for more than 300 residents in Block 325A Sumang Walk wereannounced on Monday night, after eight infections were discovered across three different households. The latest case was a13-year-old girl, a student of Paya Lebar Methodist Girls' School. Her infection was confirmed last Saturday and she currently has no links to previous COVID-19 cases. Four other residents – members of the same family – tested positive for COVID-19 earlier in May. They were linked to theChangi Airport Terminal 3 cluster. Three people in another household also tested positive–a 28-year-old Singaporean homemaker whose infection was confirmed on May 20 and two family members. The Ministry of Health (MOH) said the mandatory polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing is to prevent any possible spread in the community. If any cases are detected, they will be isolatedand their close contacts will be tested and quarantined, MOH said. MP Janil Puthucheary (PAP-Pasir Ris-Punggol)said residents were calm after receiving word of the testing. “Actually, many of them volunteered to help … the residents’ network, the grassroots volunteers and the residents of the block offered to help their neighbours,” said Dr Puthucheary. He said they will be “keeping an ear out” for residents who may be under quarantine or stay-home notice ordersand need assistance. “We have quite a few families here with children.They know each other quite well and they've pledged to help to look after each other.” Common areas at the block have been cleaned and disinfected, Dr Puthucheary said. A total of 361 residents across 124 households will undergo the swab tests. The tests will be conducted at the pavilion at Block 324 Sumang Walk on Tuesday and Wednesday from 9am to 4pm. MOH has also encouraged people who visited the block from May 10 to Jun 5 to come forward for testing. The ministry said in an update on Tuesday evening that 230 residents and visitors of Block 325A Sumang Walk had been tested as of 12pm. UPDATE ON HOUGANG AVENUE 8 TESTING MOH also provided an update on the testing exercise forseveral blocks inHougang Avenue 8last week. A total of 4,091 visitors of Block 506 Hougang Avenue 8, as well as residents and visitors of seven nearby blocks, have voluntarily stepped forward for testing as of 12pm on Tuesday. Of these, 3,965 individuals were negative for COVID-19 infection and 126more test results are pending. The testing exercise last week was the second round of mandatory COVID-19 testing for residents and visitors ofBlock 506 Hougang Avenue 8. It was conducted after a new cluster was linked to Block 506, and viral fragments were detected in wastewater samples from some of the blocks in the area. The seven neighbouring blocks are511 Hougang Avenue 10; 681, 683 and 684 Hougang Avenue 8; 682 Hougang Avenue 4; and 685 and 698 Hougang Street 61. Additional reporting by Nisha Rahim.

       " {'text': 'covid 19 77 fined parks no mask enforcement hdb common areas 14992678 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: A total of 77 people have been fined for breaching COVID-19 regulations in parks since the start of Phase 2 (Heightened Alert), the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE) said on Friday (Jun 11). These individuals flouted safe management measures in parks managed by the National Parks Board (NParks). Some of them had gathered in groups of more than two people while others did not wear a mask even though they were not engaging in strenuous exercises. MSE said two groups of eight individuals were caught gathering in Changi Beach Park and East Coast Park. NParks has also issued more than 6,000 advisories to individuals for not wearing masks and more than 800 advisories for gathering in groups of more than two people, added MSE. To ensure that parks remain safe for all, NParks will continue to temporarily close access to some parks, as well as sections of beaches, lawns, and facilities when those areas get too crowded or where people remain non-compliant with safe management measures, said MSE. These facilities include areas such as hard courts, shelters and car parks. Members of the public are advised to check the Safe Distance @ Parks portal for the latest updates on visitorship levels before heading to parks. “We request all park visitors to be socially responsible and to keep our green spaces safe for everyone. Visitors should observe safe management measures such as keeping to allowable group sizes, as well as wearing a mask except when engaging in strenuous exercises or consuming food, drink or medication,” said MSE. MORE ENFORCEMENT AT PARKS, HDB ESTATE COMMON AREAS MSE said agencies have also stepped up enforcement at hotspots including parks and Housing Board (HDB) estate common areas such as basketball courts and pavilions. This comes after public feedback and ground observations of areas where safe management measures were more frequently breached. Where repeated breaches of safe management measures have been observed, agencies will close off facilities to ensure the safety of the community, said MSE. MSE cited an example where more than a dozen people were found gathering at a pavilion at Block 90 Pipit Road for dance sessions on several occasions. In view of the multiple breaches of the safe management measures, the pavilion was cordoned off on May 31. “We therefore urge members of the public to use these facilities responsibly,” said MSE. From Jun 14, the limit on group sizes for social gatherings will be increased from two to five people, as part of the first step in Singapore’s plan to move back to Phase 3 (Heightened Alert). Five distinct visitors per household daily will also be allowed and social gatherings should be limited to no more than two a day. More restrictions will be eased from Jun 21, when dining-in will be allowed to resume if the COVID-19 situation remains under control in the coming weeks.

SINGAPORE: With COVID-19 vaccinations in full swing and students over 12 years old eligible from this month, you or your family members may be gearing up for the first or second dose of the vaccine. But why have some fully vaccinated people been infected? Can you do anything to boost your immunity before getting your shots? With similar questions in mind, Talking Point host Diana Ser spoke to infectious disease experts. She came away equipped to separate fact from fiction and convinced that getting vaccinated “is the right thing to do”, not only for herself but “to help protect those around us”. Here is what you need to know about this crucial aspect of the fight against the novel coronavirus. WATCH: Why do vaccinated folks still get COVID-19? 10+1 common vaccination questions (8:10) Q Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna — what is the difference? A In Singapore, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine has been approved for use in those aged 12 or over, while Moderna is approved for people aged 18 or above. Their efficacy is about the same: 95 per cent for Pfizer-BioNTech and 94 per cent for Moderna. Both use mRNA technology, which teaches our cells to make a protein that triggers an immune response in our bodies. “The main difference is that the doses of the two vaccines are different,” said Ooi Eng Eong of Duke-National University of Singapore (NUS) Medical School. Pfizer-BioNTech uses 30 micrograms of mRNA, while Moderna uses 100 micrograms. It does not mean the Moderna vaccine is thrice as potent as Pfizer’s. The difference is due to “guesswork” on the companies’ part “as to where the sweet spot for the dose of the vaccine is”, said the professor. It looks like the email address you entered is not valid. Q Does a higher dosage mean more side effects? A It seems so, at least in phase three of the trial data, where side effects such as tiredness and rate of fever “appear to be more common in the Moderna vaccine” than the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, said Ooi. “But we can’t be sure that it’s entirely due to dosage,” he added. Side effects are caused by the body’s immune response to the vaccine. Out of more than 2.2 million doses administered as of Apr18, there were 95 reports of suspected serious vaccine reactions, said the Health Sciences Authority. That is a rate of 0.004 per cent, with 20 of these cases involving a potentially life-threatening allergic reaction called anaphylaxis. Q Will exercising the day before my jab boost my immunity and the vaccine’s efficacy? A No, according to Tseng Hsien Cho, physician lead at the Raffles Medical Group. This is because some people may do too much strenuous exercise and experience discomfort the following day, which makes their immune system “worse than usual”, he said. Regular exercise, a healthy balanced diet and adequate sleep, however, can help to maximise the vaccine’s efficacy. “Just one night of good sleep the day before can help to boost one’s immunity,” he said. Q Could alcohol affect my immune response? A Chronic alcoholism would “definitely” affect one’s immune system and “dampen a person’s immunity” to COVID-19. But having “a glass or two of alcohol” would not affect one’s immunity or the vaccine’s efficacy, said Tseng. Q Will moving my arm help with the soreness? What else can I do after the injection? A Yes, keeping the arm mobile improves its blood circulation and “prevents the joints from stiffening”, said Tseng. Doctors would recommend a “light snack” before the vaccination, and adequate hydration before and after the injection. But drinking too much water “may cause swelling” and even water retention. “Just eat and drink as (you) would normally do,” he advised. Q Will taking paracetamol before the jab help? A No, doctors “don’t recommend taking medication without symptoms”, Tseng said. Q If fully vaccinated people are getting infected, what is the point of the vaccine? A With mutated forms of the virus that are “quite different from the original”, said infectious diseases specialist Leong Hoe Nam, this is akin to a course syllabus changing — a student who scored 95 marks previously may fare worse now. “But even if we went back to the original strain … the (vaccine’s) efficacy was only 95 per cent,” he noted. “(Out of) 100 people, there are five (who’d) still end up with an illness, but we understand that to be mild.” Vaccination “changes a severe disease to a mild disease” and a mild disease to an asymptomatic disease. Hence people have a “responsibility” to prevent severe forms of the disease, which require oxygen or intensive care, he said. Otherwise, an “overloaded” healthcare system means other patients might not receive treatment for their ailments. “It boils down to you and me getting vaccinated, making a deadly illness very mild or asymptomatic, protecting ourselves and keeping our healthcare institutions working well,” he added. WATCH: The full episode — How effective is the COVID-19 vaccine? Why the vaccinated still get infected(21:55) Q How long will my protection last? A About 30 per cent of people overall will have antibodies that last for years at least, said Leong. The other 70 per cent “won’t have enough”: The antibodies will fall in time or “never mount adequately”. In those cases, “you’ll need to remind the immune system by going for a booster vaccine”, he added. Q How much of the population has been vaccinated? Is there a magic number? A Nearly four in 10 residents have had at least one jab, and the next target is to get at least the first dose to two in three residents by early next month, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on Monday. Initially, experts believed that herd immunity could be reached if 70 per cent of the population is vaccinated. But with the new, more transmissible variants, “many experts around the world think that it should be about 80 per cent”, said Hsu Li Yang, the NUS Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health’s infectious diseases programme leader. Herd immunity means “those who aren’t vaccinated will still be indirectly protected” because people around them are vaccinated, acting like a “shield”. The associate professor cautioned, however, that herd immunity does not mean COVID-19 “will go away”. “There’ll still be occasional cases and maybe even clusters … after we’ve achieved the vaccination rate of about 80 per cent,” he said. “I’m not sure that there’s a magic number in this case.” Q What will herd immunity look like? Will social distancing and masking up still be needed? A “That’s like looking into the crystal ball,” said Hsu. Scientists are not sure, but as he sees it, this is unlikely to happen in “the next three to four years at least”. Ultimately, it also depends on Singapore’s tolerance for COVID-19. For countries that do not want a single case, even if 80 per cent or more of the population is vaccinated, people would still need to wear masks and be careful about travellers coming in across the borders, he said. If the approach is to “reduce the risk of COVID-19” so that it becomes like the flu, and the population can accept “a few cases, a few outbreaks, maybe a few deaths”, then Singapore “can start peeling back our restrictions and mask-wearing and stuff”.

       " {'text': 'sinovac mrna no evidence inactivated covid 19 vaccines 14966950 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: There is \"no evidence\" that inactivated virus vaccines demonstrate higher efficacy against COVID-19 variants than messenger RNA (mRNA)-based vaccines, said the government-appointed expert committee on COVID-19 vaccination in Singapore. \"We have noted social media messages asserting that the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are ineffective against (variants of concern)and that inactivated virus COVID-19 vaccines would provide superior protection,\" said the committee in a media release on Monday (Jun 7). The two vaccines currently used in Singapore\\'s national vaccination programme- Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna - are based on mRNA technology. Both were recommended by the expert committeeandauthorised by the Health Science Authority (HSA) under the Pandemic Special Access Route (PSAR). The committee said its assessment, based on a continual review of data and evidence, remains that the authorised mRNA vaccines are \"safe and highly effective\" and continue to show protection against the virus variants. \"The inactivated virus COVID-19 vaccines have variable protection and there is currently no evidence to suggest that inactivated virus vaccines demonstrate higher vaccine efficacy against (variants of concerns) than the mRNA vaccines,\" said the committee. The Sinovac vaccine, of which Singapore has 200,000 doses, uses inactivated viruses. Monday\\'s clarification by the expert committee follows a similar statement less than three weeks ago, in response to an open letter by 12 doctors that had called for children to be given COVID-19 vaccines other than mRNA ones over fears of \"unknown and unstudied\" long-term side effects. Eleven of the 12 doctors later retracted their statements. AUTHORISED VACCINES \"SAFE AND EFFECTIVE\" AGAINST COVID-19 Both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines have shown to be highlyefficacious, especially in protecting against severe COVID-19 disease and hospitalisation, said the committee. It said thehigh efficacy of the vaccineswas demonstrated in Phase 3 clinical trials, and further supported with data from real-world rollouts of the vaccines, including in the United States, the UK and Israel. This also includes protection against key COVID-19 variants such as the Alpha and Beta variants, which were the predominant strains circulating in these countries. The Alpha variant,B117, was first detected in the UK while the Beta variant, B1351, was first detected in South Africa. The committee added that despite concerns over the Delta variant, which was first detected in India, data showed that the mRNA vaccines continue to be effective. It cited a study in the UK, which showed that two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine gave about 88 per cent protection against symptomatic COVID-19, even with the Delta variant. \"While further studies are required before a definitive conclusion can be made, the available data globally indicates that substantial protection is preserved,\" said the committee. It added that protection given by any vaccine is not 100 per cent and \"vaccine-breakthrough\" infections can occur, with the emergency and spread of new variants due to mutations. \"The detection of asymptomatic to mild infections locally with the Delta variant does not indicate a lack of protection,\" it said, adding that the findings are in keeping with global evidence that mRNA vaccines have a \"high level\" of protection against symptomatic and severe COVID-19 disease. The committee said both mRNA vaccines were approved by multiple international regulatory bodies. Their manufacturers have also\"publicly released\" detailed study protocols, as well as openly published their findings to be scrutinised by the scientific community after peer review. Detailed assessments of the vaccines by regulatory bodies such as the US Food and Drug Administration and the UK Medicines & Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency have also been publicly published. \"In sum, the PSAR-authorised mRNA vaccines have reliable scientific evidence that they are safe and effective, and the (committee) continues to strongly recommend that medically eligible persons should be vaccinated with them,\" it said. SINOVAC PROTECTION AGAINST NEW VARIANTS STILL UNKNOWN The committee said the Sinovac COVID-19 vaccine has yet to meet the requirements for a PSAR authorisation by the HSA. Additional safety and quality data required to meet the standards of the evaluation are still pending. The Sinovac vaccine, which is developed by China\\'s Sinovac Biotech, has shown variable protection across multiple studies carried out internationally, said the committee. The most complete analysis of the vaccine showed an efficacy of 51 per cent on per-protocol analysis. However, its protection against newer variants such as the Delta variant and under real-world conditions remain unknown, the committee added. The Sinovac COVID-19 vaccine was approved for emergency use by the World Health Organization last Tuesday. The WHO recommended that it be usedforpeople aged 18 years and older. As such, the Sinovac vaccine is currently not an option for children and adolescents globally nor in Singapore under the special access route. \"It is critical that medical professionals do not spread unsubstantiated and unscientific information. \"The public has a right to expect medical professionals to give advice based on fact and not on unproven assertions,\" said the committee. It also reminded members of the public to rely on reputable sourcesof scientific and medical information, as well as verify opinions shared by others against such sources.

       " {'text': 'self isolation household members covid 19 close contacts necessa 14939248 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: The new strategy of getting entire households to self-isolate at home if one member has been identified as a close contact of a COVID-19 case is necessary, but it is not likely to be a long-term approach, saidinfectious diseases experts. The measure was announced on Monday (May 31) as authorities noted that with more infectiousCOVID-19 strains, transmission of the virus may occurmore quickly among people who live together. Members of the same household can be released from isolation only after the person under quarantine for being a close contact of a COVID-19 casetests negative. “With this new highly transmissible (B16172) strain we have to do this to get ahead of the game. There are currently many linked cases that are not isolated at the time of diagnosis. This measure is targeting those people,” said senior consultant at the National University Hospital’s division of infectious diseases Professor Dale Fisher. Prof Fisher, who is also chair of the national infection prevention and control committee at the Ministry of Health (MOH),described the approach as “very targeted and clever”. The aim of the measure is to \"movetwo steps ahead of the virus\", saidProfessor Leo Yee Sin, executive director of the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID). At a media conference on Monday, Health Minister Ong Ye Kung provided numbers on COVID-19 cases who were linked to previous infectious but were not quarantined. They made up 21 per cent of the 182 cases reported between May 17 and 23 and a quarter of the 136 cases in the next seven days, he said. He added that close to 70 per cent of all linked new cases are due to household transmissions. \"Network ringfencing becomes more necessary now than previously” with new variants that are more transmissible, said deanof the National University of Singapore’s Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health Professor Teo Yik Ying. “The incubation period may be as short as one or two days, and so household contacts may also be infected and be contagious before contact tracing can catch up,” he added. STRATEGY LIKELY TO BE TEMPORARY Prof Teo said that while this approach will help in the short-term to “keep up or even stay ahead of the transmissions happening within the community”, itis unlikelyto be the long-term strategy that Singapore will adopt. “I expect this strategy will be eased when the vaccination uptake in Singapore is sufficiently high,” he said. Prof Fisher similarly said that as more get vaccinated, “we will become less dependent on measures such as these”. Professor Paul Tambyah, president of the Asia Pacific Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infection, said that the key to controlling the virus remains mass vaccination. “These strategies may help in the interim but the focus on expanding vaccination is key,” he said. As for the impact of the strategy,Prof Fisher said Singapore should see the number of COVID-19 diagnoses made outside of quarantine fall in “even just a few days” while Prof Tambyah said the traditional approach is to wait for one incubation period or 14 days to see the effectiveness of any measure. “We would be able to see results near the end of Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) in mid-June,” he added. CHALLENGES OF THE STRATEGY While the strategy is likely to slow transmission within the community, it is not without challenges. These include getting buy-in from people as the measure isnot mandated by law, Prof Fisher said. “But they need to know that they may be saving Singapore from more stringent measures. If one of their family members is a contact then all household members should stay home until cleared as they could be the next link in the chain of transmission,” he said. Prof Teo noted that the main challenge is the inconvenience to the entire household as they will need to rely on others to deliver food, medication and other essential items. “Compliance (with the measure) may be patchy,”he added. Job security may be another concern for some, said Prof Tambyah, adding that some people may not be willing to be identified ashousehold contacts of first-degree contacts if they feel that their jobs would be in“jeopardy” due to self-isolation. Having everyone confined at home would also increase the risk of transmission among them. “While the wider public is protected, large families in small homes may have high rates of infection. This is what happened in the dormitories last year when there were many individuals in each room with even more sharing toilet and shower facilities,” Prof Tambyahsaid. Self-isolation, which is an “efficient” strategy in limiting transmission, will have to go hand in hand with other strategies, said Professor of infectious diseases Laurent Renia from Nanyang Technological University’s Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine. These include vaccination, social distancing and other public health measures. “To contain any new waves, we have to continue testing to detect any new community and imported cases in the community and then isolate the positive cases,” he said.

       " {'text': 'moh reviewing covid 19 processes inclusive people special needs 14977136 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) is reviewing its COVID-19 processes and arrangements to be more inclusive ofpeople with special needs, Parliamentary Secretary for Health Rahayu Mahzam said on Wednesday (Jun 9). The ministry is also looking into engaging people who are trained to work with thosewith special needs, she said in a Facebook post at midnight. “My colleagues at MOH will work to improve on our processes,” she said. Her post came a day after a family member of a person with special needs wrote on Facebookthe issues her brother faced during the swab and quarantine process. WHAT HAPPENED Ms Amylia Koh had detailed her experienceafter her brother, who has an intellectual disability and relies on his family to care for him,was issued a quarantine order. He is a client atMINDSville@Napiri, which is currently an open cluster. As ofTuesday, 33 people from the home for people with intellectual and developmental disabilitieswere diagnosed with COVID-19. Ms Koh, who said that she was writing the post as a “frustrated caregiver”, wrotethat after a request for quarantine at home was declined, she made arrangements with MOH to care for her brother during his stay at a government quarantine facility. “My brother would be out of his routine, in an unfamiliar setting, away from our parents. People with special needs thrive on routine and might engage in maladaptive behaviours due to change,” she said. However, she initially had issues accompanying him. “Not only was the team unprepared to manage QO (quarantine order) cases of persons with special needs, but also demonstrated a severe lack of compassion and understanding when caregivers tried to enlighten them on the disability and their needs,” she said. She also raised her concerns about the swabbing process. “To describe the swabbing experience as horrifying would be to undermine what my brother was put through,” she said. She addedthat although she was his caregiver and “the person who was most equipped to handle my brother and his needs, I was instructed to watch from a distance”. “All the swabbers took turns trying to swab my brother, who became increasingly frustrated and was on the brink of an aggressive meltdown,” she said. Half an hour later, \"they finally heeded my suggestion and allowed me to step in and assist them\", she said. She also said she had enquired on the possibility of using alternative testing methods such as a newbreathalyzer testthat has receivedprovisional authorisation by the Health Sciences Authority. ENGAGING EXPERIENCED PEOPLETO WORKWITH PEOPLE WITH SPECIAL NEEDS In response to Ms Koh\\'s post, Ms Rahayu said that MOH hasheard her feedback and will improve communications between various agencies involved in managing the quarantine process. \"We understand their grievance and it is indeed unfortunate that they had to go through such an experience,\" she said. \"We recognise that the swab process and the quarantine can be more challenging for persons with special needs as they may not be comfortable with unfamiliar people or environment.\" Ms Rahayu, whohas a child with special needs, said that these tests need to be done by people who are trainedto ensure accurate results, but that these professionals have not been specially trained to deal with peoplewith special needs. \"We are looking into engaging relevant professionals, as well as volunteers from the National Council of Social Service, who are trained to work with persons with special needs,\" she said. She said that the ministrywill also look into the various feedback received, including studying the effectiveness of deploying alternative COVID-19 tests while balancing the considerations for speed, comfort and accuracy of the test. \"We will also improve communications between the various agencies involved in managing the quarantine process,\" she added. She noted that quarantine of close contacts is carried out for effective containment of cases to limit the spread of the COVID-19 virus in the community. \"We accommodate requests for an accompanying caregiver for persons under quarantine (PUQ) with an extenuating circumstance,\" she said referring to people who may be elderly, minors or those who have a medical condition and are unable to look after themselves. \"We have reminded Certis, our agent for quarantine orders, to be mindful and exercise compassion when dealing with persons with special needs,\" she said. She added that those who man the operations on the ground, work very hardto manage various cases. They do their best and often have to keep learning and keep improving so that they can make processes better for all, she said. \"COVID-19 has tested all of us and we have to keep finding the best way to suppress this pandemic, as we continue to be compassionate and considerate to one another,\" she said.

       " {'text': 'covid 19 mrna vaccine small risk heart inflammation moh hsa 14995786 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners Six cases, four involving men aged between 18 to 30 years old, have been reported in Singapore. SINGAPORE: There may be a \"very small risk\"of heart inflammation after the second dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, said the government-appointed expert committee on COVID-19 vaccination in Singapore. In a media release on Friday (Jun 11), the committee said it is closely monitoring international reports that the second dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines may be associated with a small risk of myocarditis and pericarditis in young men. Myocarditis andpericarditis are inflammatory conditions that affect the heart muscles and the outer lining of the heart respectively. Increased occurrences of myocarditis andpericarditis after the second dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccinations have been observed in Israel and the United States, and in adolescents and young men younger than 25 years. Singapore uses the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines for its national vaccination programme. Both are mRNA-based vaccines. In a separate update, the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) said Israel, which uses the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, recently announced that there may be a probable link between the second dose and the onset of myocarditis in men aged between 16 and 30 years old in its population. The link was found stronger among the younger age group of 16 to 19 years old. While no other country has highlighted a similar causal link to date, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported that it hasobserved more cases of myocarditis and pericarditis in male patients aged between 16 and 24 years old. \"Nonetheless, they have stressed that investigations are ongoing, and they have not made any conclusion about a causal link,\" said HSA. MOST CASESARE \"MILD\", SIX SUCH REPORTS RECEIVED BY HSA Myocarditis and pericarditis occur more often in men compared to women. Symptoms include chest pain, shortness of breathor abnormal heartbeats. Most cases are mild and patients recover without the need for significant intervention, nor do they suffer from any long-term effects. The expert committee added that very rarely, severe cases may result in damage to the heart muscles. The two conditions are separate and distinct from heart attacks, which are caused when the blood flow to the heart is blocked. In Singapore, HSA said it has received six such reports as of Jun 7. Two of the cases involved a man and a woman older than 40 years old. The other four cases involved men aged between 18 and 30 years old. \"(The four cases) areat the upper end of the expected range for this age group, based on background incidence rates,\" said HSA. Most of the cases were reported to have occurred within a few days after receiving the second dose of the vaccine. All have recovered or have been discharged well from the hospital. Although the local numbers are small, the pattern of occurrence after the second COVID-19 vaccine and in young men is consistent with what has been observed in the US and Israel, which are the two major users of the mRNA vaccines, said HSA. Those who developed myocarditis and pericarditis responded well to treatment and recovered, added HSA. \"Overall, the benefits of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines continue to outweigh the known risks of COVID-19 disease and its severe complications in a pandemic,\" it added. The authority has also informed the Ministry of Health (MOH) and the expert committee of its assessment. \"We will also continue to monitor this closely and take the relevant and necessary regulatory actions,\" said HSA. The committee said it has reviewed the available international and local data. \"Our assessment is that the benefits of receiving the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, i.e., reduction in COVID-19 infections and severe complications even if infected, continue to outweigh the risks of vaccination.\" AVOID STRENUOUS ACTIVITY ONE WEEK AFTER SECOND DOSE OF VACCINE As further studies and investigations are ongoing, the currently available data suggests that theremay be a \"very small risk\" of myocarditis and pericarditis after the second dose of an mRNA vaccine, particularly in young men, said the expert committee As a precaution, the committee recommended that those vaccinated, particularly adolescents and younger men, should avoid strenuous physical activity for one week after their second dose. They should also seek medical attention promptly if they develop chest pain, shortness of breath or abnormal heartbeats. \"COVID-19 continues to be a health threat globally and in Singapore. \"The emergence of infectious variants can lead to widespread community COVID-19 transmission as well as the risk of severe COVID-19 disease and complications, including long term chronic complications,\" said the committee. It that the benefits of mRNA COVID-19 vaccination continue to outweigh the known and potential risks. HSA and MOH will also continue to monitor the safety profile of the COVID-19 vaccines closely and update members of the public of any significant safety concerns detected with the vaccines.

Shop employees from seven other blocks in the area will also be tested afterCOVID-19 viral fragments were detected in wastewater samples, the Ministry of Health said on Thursday (Jun 3). The swabbing exercisewill take place over two days. Long queues had already formed outside the test sites when CNA arrived at the scene at around 9am on Friday. The swabs are being carried out at the void deck of Block 507 Hougang Avenue 8 andthe tented pavilion at Block 685A Hougang Street 61. The new round of testing aims to detect cases who wereincubating the virus in the first round of testing and to prevent spread in the community, saidMOH. In an Instagram post on Thursday night, Member of Parliament for Aljunied Gerald Giam, who oversees the area, said his team had just conducted another round of late-night letter drops to share information about the latest swab operation. He added that residents couldcontact him if they hadany concerns or questions. BUSINESSES BRACING FOR A DROP IN SALES Businesses CNA spoke to said they are currently arranging for their employees to gofor their tests in batches. However, they are also bracing themselves for a drop in sales. Mr Leonard Ting, who owns a scooter repair shop at 684 Hougang Avenue 8, said his sales had dropped by 50 per centwhen news ofpositive casesat Block 506 Hougang Avenue 8 first broke in May. On some days, his shop served fewer than five customers. “If this continues and there are more confirmed cases, this will really hurt our business,” he said. “We used to have about 15 customers a day, but after the first round of testing, people were afraid and they wanted to stay away.” Nearby Mr Ting’s shop, over at Block 681 Hougang Avenue 8,employees ofAl-Falah Restauranthave increased the frequency of cleaning and sanitising to four times a day, up from two previously. They have also been instructed to clean surfaces, such as those touched by customers, throughout the day. Already hard-hit by tighter measures to control the growing number of community cases, Mr Mohamed Ansar Ali, the restaurant’s senior manager, said the stepped-up cleaning routinewillgive employeesand customers a “peace of mind”. “Our business has dropped by 70 per centsince Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) and we hardly see any customers,” he said. “So whencustomers (notice the restaurant) isclean, maybe they will be more comfortable to buy from (us).\" VITAL TO IDENTIFY SYMPTOMATIC INDVIDUALS: PROF TAMBYAH Professor Paul Tambyah, president of the Asia Pacific Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infection told CNA that the key from this round of testingis to identify symptomatic individuals. “In reality, asymptomatic individuals or pre-symptomatic individuals can spread the virus, but symptomatic individuals spread the virus far more effectively than an asymptomatic individual, so people must be able to go and seek medical attention without fear of the impact of a quarantine or a stay-home notice,” he said.

TheModerna COVID-19 vaccine is currentlyauthorised for use in Singapore for people aged 18 and above. The vaccination centre at Kolam Ayer Community Club is run by Minmed. \"Our investigations found that the individual’s date of birth had been erroneously entered when booking a vaccination appointment after receiving the sign-up link,\" the ministries said in a joint press release early Friday morning. \"This resulted in his age being incorrectly registered as above 18 years of age, making it possible for a Moderna vaccination centre to be selected. \"The vaccination centre staff had failed to verify his age during registration, which should have been carried out.\" The error was discovered during the post-vaccination observation period whenvaccination centre staff members identified that the boy was under 18. He wasplaced under a longer observation time of 50 minutes asan additional precaution and \"remains generally well\", said the ministries. The expert committee for COVID-19 vaccination said in a separate statement that it has reviewed the incident where the teen was \"erroneously administered\" the Moderna vaccine dose. \"The expert committee for COVID-19 vaccination does not expect any safety issues from the receipt of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine in the 16-year-old youth, and the medical team will consult the expert committee on what would be best for the youth for the completion of the vaccination,\" it said. \"Data from a trialinvolving more than 3,700 adolescents aged 12 to 17 years old has found that the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine is safe and effective among adolescents with no significant safety issues identified. The majority of adverse events were mild or moderate in severity, and the common ones were injection site pain, headache, fatigue, muscle aches and chills.\" Only the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine has been authorised for use in Singapore for children aged 12 and above. \"The safety of those receiving the vaccination is of utmost priority,\"said the ministries, adding that they take a serious view of the incident. \"We apologise for the inconvenience and anxiety caused, and have reached out to the youth’s parents to explain the situation.\" A \"thorough review\" of internal processes at vaccination sites has been carried out by MOH to prevent a recurrence of the incident. This includes strengthening itsonline registration process to ensure peoplemake appointments at suitable vaccination centres based on their eligibility, andputting in place more stringent protocols at vaccination sites to verify eligibility. \"We are in close contact with the individual and his family, and will continue to monitor his health closely and provide the necessary support,\" added the ministries. The committee said that it willcontinue to monitor \"global evidence\" and developments on COVID-19 vaccines, in particular emerging data on the efficacy and safety of vaccine use for more population subgroups.

While demand is still outstripping supply in many doctors\\' practices, this will switch to a surplus in the next few weeks, Health Minister Jens Spahn said, adding the country needed to press on fast with vaccinations to prevent the Delta variant from taking hold. The government will deliver 5 million doses to regional vaccination centres in the first week of July and drugmaker Moderna Inc will be able to deliver double the doses it had originally promised Germany, Spahn said in a televised discussion on the coronavirus. That will mean the country will shift to campaigning more actively to encourage those who are hesitant to get a shot, offering vaccines to passers-by in city centres, or at churches and mosques. Spahn said there were already hundreds of thousands of doses of vaccines produced by AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson that were not immediately being used in doctors practices. Many Germans favour the vaccine made by Pfizer/ BioNTech. Germany has now fully vaccinated more than a third of the total population, while 53per cent have had a first shot, with 852,814 doses injected on Friday alone, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI)public health agency reported on Saturday. RKI head Lothar Wieler said Germany wanted to vaccinate at least 80per cent of the population: \"We need to reach that figure so we have basic protection.\" Even though infection rates are currently low in Germany, Spahn said the rapid spread of the Delta variant in Britain and Israel showed the need for speedy vaccinations. The RKI declared on Friday that Portugal and Russia will be added to its list of \"virus-variant zones\" that already includes Britain and that triggers restrictions on travel. The total number of coronavirus cases in Germany increased by 592 to 3,726,172 on Saturday, while the death toll rose by 68 to 90,746.

As a precautionary measure, individuals who were at these locations during the specified timings should monitor their health closely for 14 days from the date of their visit. \"They should see a doctor promptly if they develop symptoms of acute respiratory infection (such as cough, sore throat and runny nose), as well as fever and loss of taste or smell, and inform the doctor of their exposure history,\" said the ministry. There is no need to avoid places where confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been, added MOH. \"The National Environment Agency will engage the management of affected premises to provide guidance on cleaning and disinfection,\" said the Health Ministry. Singapore reported15 new COVID-19 community infections on Tuesday, seven of which were not linked to previous cases. There were also three imported cases.

       " {'text': 'singapore heartland shops partner sweden firms covid 19 15067562 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: From electrical and pipe fittings to nails and bolts of various shapes and sizes, hardware store InHome Trading carries hundreds of home repair tools and products in its small shop located at a HDB block in Ang Mo Kio. The long-time business has served many generations of residents in the neighbourhood although these days, it also takes on orders from other parts of Singapore through its online store on e-commerce platform Lazada. The latter may not be much for now, said InHome’s second-generation owner Chia Wei Liat, but it is a way to cope with the uncertainties of running a retail business amid the prolonged COVID-19 pandemic. The hardware store actually made the first step to go digital in 2019, recalled the 35-year-old who took over the family business about five years ago. However, given a lack of expertise and time, its page on Lazada looked “rundown” with limited products for the longest time. “Previously the homepage was just a list of products - no sorting or any categories. We were doing this on our own and going online was a very new thing for us,” said Mr Chia. With some help, the online store went through a revamp in September last year. It now features products sorted by categories, brands and popularity. It also worked on its Google Business page by adding in details such as operating hours, phone number and a link to its online store. Customers can now leave reviews as well. The helping hand in going digital came from an unlikely partner – Swedish pest control firm Anticimex. “Their marketing team helped redesignthe layout of our online store. Now it looks much nicer and appealing to customers,” said Mr Chia. “They also helped us to set up our Google Business page. We didn’t know how to but after they told us to submit some documents, we can finally add in details such as operating hours and change the previous address which wasn’t that accurate,” he added. “This has definitely increased our brand awareness. We had people calling and said they found our number on Google.” “MAKE SOMETHING POSITIVE” The unlikely collaboration of a heartland merchant and a multinational corporation (MNC) was the result of a Sweden-Singapore initiative organised by the Swedish Chamber of Commerce Singapore (SwedCham). The initiative, according to SwedCham general manager Lisa Ferraton, aimed to foster collaboration between small and large companies during a difficult time. The MNCs sponsored an advertising campaign, which ran on selected buses and bus stops in November last year, to promote their smaller partners. Each pair also had meetings dubbed “Fika4Good”, a reference to the Swedish tradition of fika or chats over coffee, to discuss issues they face and how to solve them. Apart from InHome and Anticimex, 22 other Swedish MNCs and small home-grown businesses ranging from hawkers to tailors were paired up. Ms Ferraton noted that the chamber was pleased with what the initiative has achieved so far. “When we started this, we didn’t know where this project would go. We just wanted to try to make something positive in a challenging environment,” she said. Mr Chia admitted that he too went into the initiative with little expectations, partly as his bigger partner came from an entirely different industry. Working with an MNC that employed hundreds of people also seemed unimaginable for a heartland merchant with fewerthan 10 employees. But after a couple of meetings, the unlikely partners found some common ground. Mr Philip Tan, general manager for sales in Asia at Anticimex, recalled: “My CFO (chief financial officer) and I visited Chia at Ang Mo Kio for our first meeting and when he told us that he had to close previously because of COVID-19 but their online store is not quite (set up), we immediately knew this is where we can help them. “I roped in our marketing team to find out more about Chia’s online business and we formed a plan. Chia liked it and we had more discussions. It took us about two months to complete everything.” These days, Mr Chia checks for online orders twice a day on his smartphone. Delivery bags and a printer are also among the new additions to the shop’s cashier counter. He is aware that having an online presence “is not a one-off effort”. The store on Lazada is updated monthly with new products and competitive pricing, as being online means competition with even more sellers in and out of Singapore. “All these will require time and effort on our part but I think it’s good enough that Anticimex gave us an initial kick-off,” said Mr Chia. H&M MEETS TRADITIONAL TAILOR Partners under the initiative did not all come from differing industries. Fashion giant H&M, for instance, was paired up with local tailor Nancy Kong, which it said was a great fit. “This is very much in line with our aim for a more circular and sustainable fashion, meaning that we want to keep everything in the loop as much as possible, maximise the use of resources and minimise waste,” said H&M Southeast Asia’s sustainability manager Marian Dang. Tailors help to prolong the lifespan of old clothes by altering or repairing them, or even give them a new life through upcycling, she added. “We also felt that traditional tailors were not getting as much exposure as they should, and we want to help. So in various ways, Nancy was perfect for us,” said Ms Dang, while noting that H&M promoted Ms Kong through advertisements and shout-outs on its social media platforms. Ms Kong, who has been running Vega Tailoring and Dressmaking shop at Bukit Timah Plaza for the past three decades, said the pandemic has added to the difficulty of running a traditional business. While she has built up a group of loyal customers, revenue has halved, largely becauserestrictions on wedding receptions and people continuing to work from home mean little need for tailor-made suits or dresses. The additional exposure is certainly welcomed although she felt “a little paiseh (\\'shy\\' in Hokkien)” when her customers sent her photos of the bus ads, the soft-spoken woman told CNA with a chuckle. Ms Kong, who is inher 60s, has also been sewing fabric masks since last year, partly in an attempt to keep operating during the “circuit breaker” that shut all non-essential services. Dozens of them bearing colourful prints and some with fancy sequins and beads, are still on display outside her shop. “Running a business means you just have to keep adapting. Change is the only way out,” she said in Mandarin. But even with a keen adaptability, Ms Kong said her business faces another crucial problem that is manpower. Her trade requires an eye for details and also years to hone one’s skills. But many Singaporeans have shunned the industry while she is unable to hire foreigners due to quota restrictions. Noting that she knows of many peers who have retired, she said: “It is really difficult to hire anyone, but I will carry on this for as long as I can.” This was a new observation for Ms Dang. “We started with wanting to create more exposure for Nancy, but talking to her made us realise that there is also a manpower issue so simply increasing demand is going to make it very difficult for her.” With that in mind, H&M said it is exploring other ways to collaborate more meaningfully with Ms Kong. Ms Ferraton noted: \"One thing I\\'ve seen is how this is promoting understanding and adding value to both the MNCs and SMEs. That\\'s why I want to emphasise that we didn’t go into this initiative to teach the SMEs. We wanted to start a dialogue.\" Trade and Industry Minister Gan Kim Yong said that the initiative was a “clear example” of how Swedish and Singapore companies have come together to help one another amid the pandemic. “The campaign translated to increased exposure, footfall and sales for our local partners. I want to encourage such collaborations under the initiative to continue,” he said at a business event last month. SwedCham said it is considering pairing up MNCs with larger SMEs as part of the next phase of the initiative but this remains a work in progress. What is confirmed is that the “Fika4Good” meetings will continue, alongside another programme that sees Swedish firms hosting company attachments as part of the Workforce Singapore’s SGUnited Mid-CareerPathways Programme. “This is an important area for us atSwedCham so the local outreach will definitely continue,” said Ms Ferraton.

       " {'text': 'travel passport vaccination certs southeast asia asean singapore 15039622 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners While reopening borders is not currently feasible given the epidemiological situation, now is the time to start preparing for a gradual reopening and facilitating a resumption of international air travel, writes Brendan Sobie. SINGAPORE: It has been a rough quarter for Southeast Asia’s aviation and tourism sectors as new record waves of COVID-19 cases have set back domestic recoveries and timelines for resuming international travel. Southeast Asia now faces a slower recovery than other regions, which could have economic implications and make it harder to attract international tourists for potentially several years. However, there is a light at the end of the tunnel as vaccine rollouts are starting to accelerate throughout the region. SOUTHEAST ASIA HEADING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION Vaccines have been the key in reopening borders elsewhere around the world and in reducing or waiving quarantine requirements for vaccinated travelers. Globally, more than 25 countries have waived quarantine or have plans in place to soon start waiving quarantine for vaccinated travelers. Yet, Southeast Asia has been going in the opposite direction, with some countries increasing quarantine from 14 to 21 days in recent months even forvaccinated travelers, making it impossible to recover international traffic. International passenger traffic in Southeast Asia has been stalled for several months at around 3 per cent of pre-pandemic levels, which is slightly below the current Asia-Pacific average of around 4 per cent and well below the current global average of around 15 per cent. The gap between Asia-Pacific, including Southeast Asia, and the rest of the world will grow over the next few months as other regions gradually reopen, particularly to vaccinated travelers. While COVID-19 case numbers in Southeast Asia are currently at record or near record levels, it is critical for governments to start planning for a gradual reopening of borders, initially to vaccinated travelers. This is not the time to swing open borders but it is the time to put in place new travel protocols and a framework to facilitate a resumption of international travel. It looks like the email address you entered is not valid. THAILAND SETS THE STANDARD? Thailand’s bold declaration on Wednesday (Jun 16) to reopen to vaccinated travelers within 120 days is encouraging and is the first example of a Southeast Asian country providing a reopening timeline. However, it is just a start as Thailand is just one country and has made several U-turns over the last several months, making it somewhat questionable its borders will swing open by October. There are still questions on whether Thailand will be able to start a quarantine free pilot programme in Phuket on Jul 1, when the island is slated to reopen to vaccinated travelers from low- to medium-risk countries provided the visitor does not leave the island for 14 days and meets several requirements. The Phuket “Sandbox” plan is aimed at tourists from outside the region, particularly Europe, because it is impossible to attract visitors from other countries in Southeast Asia or anywhere in Asia-Pacific until their quarantine requirements are relaxed or waived. A MULTILATERAL EFFORT NEEDED The 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) should be working together – ideally on a multilateral rather than bilateral basis – to lay the foundation for a resumption of travel within and to and from the region. For the last year, I’ve been advocating for the ASEAN Secretariat to step up and help facilitate a recovery for Southeast Asia’s aviation and tourism industries. In a June 2020 commentary,I urged ASEAN to become more active, pointing out the impact of un-harmonised standards and protocols as well as advocating the concept of travel bubbles. I subsequently expanded on this concept in a white paper published in December 2020 by the Aviation Studies Institute at the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), recommending a pan-ASEAN air transport bubble to facilitate a resumption of international air travel between ASEAN countries. An update to the white paper was published by SUTD earlier this month, concluding that “a pan-ASEAN air transport bubble as well as other ASEAN initiatives such as the ASEAN health passport would help facilitate an earlier regional recovery and provide major economic benefits”. ASEAN stated in March 2021 it was considering a common digital vaccine passport but this initiative has so far failed to progress due to a lack of confidence in its feasibility and the failure of any member-nation to step forward and lead the way. While the ASEAN health passport may not be achievable, the 10 member countries can still work together on standards and protocols, which would help facilitate a general reopening. There is also an opportunity to work together to jointly approve industry initiatives such as the International Air Transport Association (IATA) Travel Pass. Airlines in ASEAN have talked to IATA and more than a dozen other suppliers of proposed travel passes but have not moved forward due to a lack of buy-in and consensus. While there are several travel app trials in Southeast Asia involving airlines and governments, there has been little to no progress in approving any of the available platforms or the general concept. CONTINUED LACK OF CONSENSUS A continued lack of consensus on new air travel standards and protocols also remains an obstacle. Several ASEAN countries have still not adopted the new air travel guidelines recommended by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) initially published in June 2020 and updated in December 2020 and again in March 2021. ASEAN countries and in some cases local government units within countries have adopted their own regulations, resulting in a complex patchwork of rules that can be difficult to adhere to, leading to confused passengers and unusually long airport check-in times. Mutual recognition of COVID-19 tests and vaccines is particularly important but has so far failed to materialise. Some countries are only recognising the vaccines they have been using in their own countries rather than all vaccines recognised by the World Health Organisation. For example, the Philippines earlier this month reduced its quarantine requirement from 14 to seven days but only for individuals vaccinated in the Philippines. It is encouraging the Philippines has reduced quarantine times for some vaccinated travelers, but the impact will be limited until this also applies to overseas Filipinos or visitors who were vaccinated abroad. Vietnam also has been looking at reducing or waiving quarantine, currently 21 days, to vaccinated travelers but some initial reports indicate it would be limited to travelers inoculated with vaccines approved for use in Vietnam. ASEAN countries should urgently consider a mutual vaccination recognition scheme, which would help facilitate a resumption of international travel. For example, a Singapore resident vaccinated with Moderna should be able to qualify for reduced quarantine in Vietnam, Philippines or any other ASEAN country even though Singapore is the only ASEAN country using Moderna as part of its COVID-19 vaccination programme. Reduced quarantine for all vaccinated travelers in ASEAN would be a welcome first step and could subsequently be followed by waiving quarantine requirements for vaccinated travelers. ASEAN RISKS LAGGING BEHIND OTHER REGIONS If ASEAN does not start putting in place the building blocks needed to support a resumption of international travel – such as mutual recognition of vaccines – there can be long-term economic implications as other regions start to gradually reopen to vaccinated travelers. Companies in the ASEAN aviation and travel sectors will struggle to survive a prolonged closure of the international market and will also be at a competitive disadvantage to competitors in other regions as their customers from outside ASEAN discover alternative destinations. Domestic travel is important and during the pandemic has helped companies based in those ASEAN countries with significant domestic markets. However, from a revenue and economic perspective, ASEAN is much more dependent on international tourism. ASEAN also has a domestic market that is smaller and that has so far recovered slower than other regions. Domestic passenger traffic in ASEAN reached around 50 per cent of pre-pandemic levels in the fourth quarter of 2020 but declined in the first quarter of 2021 and has declined further in the second quarter of 2021 as new waves of cases led to local travel restrictions. Domestic traffic is currently at about 30 per cent of pre-pandemic levels while globally domestic traffic is now at about 75 per cent of pre-pandemic levels. While domestic travel in ASEAN could start improving again in the third quarter of this year, it will continue to lag the global average while the more critical international market will likely remain stalled at current levels until at least the fourth quarter of this year. Not much can be done about the bleak outlook for the next few months except hunker down and weather the storm as ASEAN countries focus on containing the virus and rolling out vaccines. However, now is the time for the ASEAN Secretariat and ASEAN countries to step up and put in place the protocols and framework to facilitate a recovery in international travel that could start later this year and reach significant levels early next year, as vaccination rates reach herd immunity levels. If the groundwork is not done over the next few months, the risk is an even slower recovery and an even wider gap between ASEAN and the rest of the world with potentially devastating consequences.

       " {'text': 'exercise mask high intensity fitness experts advice covid 19 14933524 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: With tighter COVID-19 measures requiring peopleto wear masks while exercising indoors,fitness studioshave made adjustments to moderate- to high-intensity workouts to adhere to the new requirements. Under Singapore\\'sPhase 2 (Heightened Alert), only low-intensity sports and physical activities are allowed at indoor facilities, with masks on at all times. Classes like spin, zumba and hot yoga, typically considered more intense, are stillbeing offered, according to a check on fitness studios’ social media pages and class booking apps. However, some studios have provided updateson how the sessions will be conducted to adhere to the rules. Some have made the workouts less intense, provided more exercise options and breaks, as well as moved outdoors. Nonetheless, fitness experts said people shouldnot push themselves too hard since they are required to have masks on. Participants should consider their personal medical history, their experience and familiarity with the type ofexercise, as well as symptoms felt during the class to decide if it is too intense for them, said Dr Cormac O\\'Muircheartaigh, a sports medicine physician. \"Light exercises means that you should be able to hold a conversation easily while exercising,\" he said, adding that people are only able to\"say words\" with very high-intensity exercises. While spinning and zumba are typically moderate- to high-intensity exercises, he noted thatthey can be safe with masks on,“provided you have no underlying medical conditions that increase your risk”. EXERCISING WITH CAUTION People withan underlying condition affecting their heart and lungs should be especiallycautious when doing more intense exercises with a mask on, saidDr O\\'Muircheartaigh, who is also the medical director of Sports Medicine Lab. These conditions include asthma, heart rhythm problems or ischaemic heart disease, he said.Those who had heat illness or injuries previously should also be more careful, he added. “In my opinion, masks will increase the work of breathing (and) increase the discomfort and difficulty in attaining peak heart rate or exercise intensity,” he said. Some of the potential dangers of doing intense exercise with a mask on include shortness of breath and dizziness, possibly triggering an asthma episode, said Mr Dexter Tay, head of training anddevelopment at fitness education academy FIT Asia. The experts also questioned the effectiveness of a mask when it becomes damp from exercise. Mr Tay said that using masks during hot yoga classes, for example, “might be questionable with the perspiration causing the masks to be wet and potentially flimsy, rendering them ineffective”. Dr O\\'Muircheartaigh similarly said that with perspiration on a mask,the effectiveness of the barrieris reducedand it becomes less effective in reducing the risk of transmission. “For high-intensity exercise, after a short period of time, the indication for wearing a mask becomes useless,” he said. Mr Tay said peoplecan choose to work out at a moderate intensity and still reap thebenefits of exercise. “It doesn’t mean ‘go hard or go home’.In fact, times like now, it ought to be ‘no need to go so hard so that you can go home’,” he said. MODIFYING CLASSES TO THE NEW NORMAL At Bolly Dancing Studio, itsdirector Mihir Wanisaid participants are encouraged to try one class to see if they can cope with exercising with a mask on, and to go easy on themselves. “We also tell our participants - whatever you are comfortable with, do only that. If you can’t do 100 per cent, listen to your own body and you can modify accordingly,” he said. “It’s lucky enough that you’re able to do a class in the studio, don’t go full out.” Mr Wani said that at Bolly Dancing Studio, which offers classes like zumba and Bollywood dancing, some changes have been made to make sessions more comfortable with masks on. Besides limiting the number of participants to improve ventilation in the studio, it has also reduced the intensity of classes, Mr Wani said. “Our classes are mainly song and choreography based, so we choose songs that are not so intense. There are steps like jumping - we avoid that,” he added. Ms Stephanie Leong, who has been attending power yoga classeswhich are typically more vigorous, said she was apprehensive at first about attending a class with her mask on the whole time. However, the 27-year-old said there were options provided to help people adjust. “The class moved at a much slower pace compared to a regular class. Poses were similar, but with many options provided to take it down a notch,” she said. Ms Leong, a fitness instructor herself, added that participants were also given the option of taking more breaks if needed. TAKING A BREAK WHEN NEEDED At one outdoor spin class, CNA similarly observed that participants were given several breaks during a 45-minute session. Many of them lowered their masks to drink water during thosebreaks. They generally appeared to be able to cope with the intensity of the class. One participant, however, could be seen with his mask below his nose several times. The instructor was also seen wearing her mask like this at times. A participant who wanted to be known only as Charlenetold CNA that she has been going for outdoor spin classes four to five times a week. The 31-year-oldsaid one difference between the indoor and outdoor classes are the heat and humidity, especially on a sunny day. “The instructors say ‘if it is very very intense, just sit down, breathe first. Don’t push yourself too hard’,” she said, adding that it is advice she has followed. She said she would mostly pause after the fast-paced moves and take a “breather” with her mask still on. Another spin enthusiast, 29-year-old Elean Ng, decided to take a break from such exerciseclasses given the new rules. “Indoors, with aircon, I am already sweating buckets and catching my breath. Won’t it be worse to be with my mask on, while in the open space?” she said. Ms Ng used to attendspin classes one to three times a week. Now, the business intelligence developer climbs the stairs to get herdose of exercise. “Stairwells are less crowded than the footpaths sometimes, and more cooling,” she said.

       " {'text': 'malaysia khairy herd immunity covid 19 vaccine postage stamp 15039722 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners KUALA LUMPUR:Malaysia must be careful when using the term \"herd immunity\" asCOVID-19 is likely to stay even after a large portion of the population is vaccinated, national coordinating minister for immunisation Khairy Jamaluddin said on Wednesday (Jul 16). Mr Khairy, who was speaking at an online forum organised by the Oxford & Cambridge Alumni Network Malaysia, said vaccination is not a guaranteed solution to the pandemic, but merely “one tool in an arsenal of measures” Malaysia has to combat COVID-19. “I\\'ve stopped using that term. \"Some of the other leaders are still using the term ‘herd immunity’. I have advised the prime minister to be careful when using the term herd immunity, simply because it is my view as the coordinating ministerlooking at the data and the sciencethat this may very well be endemic,” Mr Khairy, who is also Minister of Science, Technology and Innovation, said. “We may see COVID in a less threatening form but it will stay with us for quite some time,” he added. Earlier this month, Health Minister Adham Baba said Malaysia has ordered enough vaccines to cover 109 per cent of its population who qualify for inoculation, with the aim of achieving herd immunity against COVID-19 by December. Based on latest statistics published by Malaysia’s Special Committee on Covid-19 Vaccine Supply (JKJAV), around 14.6 million people have registered for the national COVID-19 immunisation programme. Out of this,over 3.8 million have been fully vaccinated. This is still some way off Malaysia’s target of achieving herd immunity by inoculating 80 per cent of its population, or 26.7 million out of the total 33 million people in the country. Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin was quoted by Malaysian media on Sunday as sayingthat the federal territories of Kuala Lumpur and Putrajaya would likely reach herd immunity by August with the opening of more vaccination centres. Mr Khairy reiterated the vaccination targets in Wednesday\\'s online forum, stating how the vaccination exercise would be completed for the population in Selangor, Kuala Lumpur, Putrajaya and Sarawak by the end of August. Meanwhile, the vaccination exercises for key economic states Penang and Johor would likely be done in October, while the rest of Malaysia would be completed by December. He maintained that while it was crucialfor Malaysia to focus on vaccinations, it could be “slightly misleading” given that it is just one tool in an arsenal of measures required. He explained that moving forward, it was important for Malaysia to err on the side of caution when it comes to doing away with non-pharmaceutical interventionssuch as wearing face masks and ensuring social distancing in public spaces. “I think some countries may have done this too early, especially with the B16172 variant which is far more transmissible than the original version of the virus,” said Mr Khairy. He added that Malaysia was making inroads into preparing to live with the virus by introducing testing as part of everyday life. He said that discussions were being held with neighbours Singaporeto collaborate on a COVID-19 breathalyser test. The BreFence Go COVID-19 breath test system, which was developed by Breathonix, a spin-off company of the National University of Singapore (NUS),can generate results within one minute and has received provisional authorisation from Singapore’s Health Sciences Authority (HSA). \"MALAYSIA IS DOING PRETTY WELL\" During the webinar, Mr Khairy presented a slide showcasing the percentage of the population in some Asian countries which has received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. The graph indicated that Malaysia had a higher percentage of its population who has received at least one dose, as compared tosome of its neighbouring countries. “As you can see, benchmarked against our neighbors Indonesia, Thailand, Philippines, Vietnam, and I\\'m talking (about) our bigger neighbours here because I don\\'t run a country which is the size of a postage stamp, you see that Malaysia is doing pretty well,” said Mr Khairy. \"Even compared against a country like Japan, we are slowly creeping up towards Japan,” he added. However, Mr Khairy pointed out how Malaysia’s numbers pale in comparison with countries such as Canada, United Kingdom and the United States, because those countries had “hoarded vaccines”, he said. “This is a story about vaccine inequity, where it\\'s not the capacity of vaccination that we cannot ramp up but rather it is the supplies,” said Mr Khairy. “It’s a bigger issue that we need to discuss after this pandemic is over, about intellectual property, about the sharing of patents, about opening up patents and about ensuring a fairer distribution of vaccines in a pandemic,” he added.

There have not been any confirmed COVID-19 cases at those blocks, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (May 31). The polymerase chain reaction testing for residents at blocks 501 and 507 Hougang Avenue 8 will take place from Jun 1 to 3. Testing will be conducted at the void deck of Block 507 Hougang Avenue 8 between 9am and 4pm on those dates. “While there are currently no confirmed cases residing at 501 and 507 Hougang Avenue 8, COVID-19 viral fragments were detected in wastewater samples collected from these blocks,” the ministry said. “As a precautionary measure, we will conduct mandatory COVID-19 tests for all residents of these blocks.” The health ministry also advised residents to monitor their health and consult a doctor immediately if they feel unwell. “Leaflets will be distributed and SMS notifications will be sent to the residents to provide them with more information,” said MOH. The move is part of the ministry’s surveillance measures to detect and prevent the spread of COVID-19 cases in the community. “This mandatory testing is carried out when epidemiology investigations have assessed that there is likely ongoing transmission,” it said. “In the event that a positive case is detected, MOH will isolate the case, identify all close contacts, test and quarantine them to protect the community from further transmission.” Earlier this month, the ministry tested all residents of Block506 Hougang Avenue 8 after some residents tested positive for COVID-19. Eleven COVID-19 cases from at least four different households living at the block, including two who were detected from the mandatory testing exercise. Residents atBlock559 Pasir Ris St 51 were also tested last week afterfour COVID-19 cases weredetected in two different households living in the block. On Monday, MOH also announced mandatory testing for all residents of Block 745 Yishun Street 72, after six COVID-19cases were detected there. The need for the mandatory tests at the Yishun block was first announced by MPFaishal Ibrahim (PAP-Nee Soon)in a Facebook post on Monday afternoon. Singapore reported23 new COVID-19 cases on Monday, including 16 infections in the community.

       " {'text': 'big read hawker digital apps delivery covid 19 14914316 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners Older hawkers who are neither IT-literate nor social media-savvy have been at a greater disadvantage this time round, as others in the F&B industry are better prepared to exploit the various digital platforms to keep the latest disruption to their businesses to a minimum. SINGAPORE: Fortyyears after weathering the ups and downs of the hawker trade, an elderly couple selling wanton noodles at Tekka Market in Little India said they were facing their toughest crisis yet after new COVID-19 curbs kicked in two weeks ago. By now, Mr Goh, 69, and Mrs Goh, 68, of Chin Seng Cooked Food -who declined to give their full names -felt like they had done everything they could to change their fate. They had showed up to work at 7am daily. They had ventured into the unfamiliar world of online food deliveries by becoming listed on the WhyQ platform during the April to June \"circuit breaker\" last year. And they had simply hung on when the crowds never returned for the rest of the year. And when things were back to square one on May 16, as the month-long Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) that bans dine-in at food and beverage establishments and allows only takeaways, among other things, kicked in to stem a worrying rise in the number of COVID-19 clusters and unlinked cases in the community, Mrs Goh was left blaming themselves for not having done enough. Their business has nosedived to a point where they could foresee drawing a combined salary of only S$500 for this month. “We don’t know how to use the Internet. Anything also don’t know. We don’t have Grab. Anything also don’t have,” she said, pointing to the unusually quiet scene at the iconic food centre on a Monday morning, where there were more idling hawkers than hungry customers. Like the Gohs, older hawkers who are neither IT-literate (some are illiterate to begin with) nor social media-savvy have found themselves to be at a greater disadvantage this time round, given that the other segments of the food and beverage industry are better prepared to exploit the various digital platforms to keep the latest disruption to their businesses to a minimum. In fact, many hawkers have reported even poorer business compared to last year\\'s circuit breaker, although the current curbs are relatively more relaxed. As well-known food critic and consultant K F Seetoh noted: “Last year, people were desperate. The authorities were clueless on what this virus was going to do to us, where it was going to take us. The first thing people went for was food, water and toilet paper, so people went out to buy. “This time round, after one year, people are more cool-headed as they know that there are many delivery models, they know there are (vaccine) jabs going around, so all they do is they sit back and order online.” When that happens, the “shinier hawkers, the glossier ones” get the business, as delivery platforms will naturally promote the popular bigger ticket items - the S$40 to S$50 sets, for instance - to earn more commission. “Can’t blame them. It’s their business model. But in the course of doing so, they overlook these humble and quiet hawkers, young or old,” Mr Seetoh said. ISLANDWIDE IMPACT The latest round of restrictions on dining-in has seen hawkers operating in the once-bustling areas in the city centre or city fringes -which are heavily dependent on the working or shopping crowds -being among the worst hit. These days, the popular Zhao Ji Claypot Rice at Chinatown Complex Food Centre - where people usually had to queue up to an hour to get their fix - is seeing only 5 per cent of its usual crowd, said its 58-year-old owner, Ms Deng Shu Ling, who mans the stall alone. There is “completely no business” between 2pm and 4pm on Saturdays, she added. Madam Noorhani Ali, a 57-year-old nasi padang hawker at an eating house near Geylang Serai Market, was reduced to tears on May 18 as she sat before what looks like six full trays of unsold food, having sold almost nothing near dinnertime for the third day in a row. The scene was captured on Facebook Live by entertainer Roslan Shah, who operates a rojak stand next to hers, and wanted to rally support for Mdm Noorhani. The former cook at the staff canteen at Ngee Ann City’s Takashimaya Departmental Store said her stall, Snan’s Corner, which opened on May 1, marked the fulfilment of her dream to have a nasi padang stall. But when takings amounted to only S$200 in the first week of the period of Heightened Alert, she contemplated giving up the stall and returning to work as a cook – never mind the S$5,000 in savings that she had invested to get the business going. Mdm Noorhani said: “I was telling my husband … In about a week’s time, if we really can’t make money, we will have to tell the (eating house) owner that we want to stop the business. “(Mr Roslan) is smart using all this technology (to improve business). For me, I don’t know how,” added Mdm Noorhani, who dropped out of school after Primary 4. In some other parts of Singapore’s heartlands, while the impact is not as bad as the central business district, hawkers who rely solely on footfall have also seen a dip in their business, presumably because many of their regular customers are now turning to online deliveries. Madam Sim Chee Moey, who is in her 60s, the boss of Xing Ji Rou Cuo Mian, one of the minced meat noodle stalls that were previously known for their long queues at Bedok’s 85 Fengshan Food Centre, said the lines that normally form in the evenings are gone. Her neighbouring hawker Goh Peng Huan, 61, said his stall selling fried oyster omelette, carrot cake, bak chor mee and handmade ngoh hiang is now making a loss as business has dropped by 50 to 70 per cent, partly as the supper crowds have thinned. If the period of heightened alert were to extend beyond Jun13, he said he would consider closing his stall for a while, like the BBQ seafood stall nearby which could not even achieve sales of S$100 in one day earlier this month. ALTERED CONSUMER HABITS Pandemic-related curbs aside, the older generation of hawkers must also grapple with the changing habits of their customers, especially the younger ones, who are now getting used to having food delivered to their doorstep. Also, while many customers may still want to buy from their favourite hawkers, it does not make sense for them to travel out of their way for just a takeaway, given that eating at hawker centres is not allowed for now and people are encouraged to stay at home as far as possible to break the COVID-19 transmission chain. For an entrepreneur in his 30s who wanted to be known only as Mr Chen, it is important for him to be near home to teleconference and pick up his work calls, so he is mainly getting his meals from the two coffee shops below his block. “When I feel like eating something that is not within convenient reach, I will reach out for the app,” he added, referring to a habit that developed after last year’s circuit breaker, when he relied heavily on Deliveroo’s S$14 flat monthly fee for unlimited free deliveries. Anticipating a heavier reliance on such apps, he had bought Grab’s S$1.99 stay-home pack, which was introduced shortly before May 16. It lets users shave S$4 off their delivery fees per order with a minimum spend of S$15 for 30 times. Likewise, university student Kaavya Ganeshan, 22, who had been ordering food online at least once a week since last year’s circuit breaker said that: “I guess this is safer and convenient during this period of time where there still is local transmission of COVID-19.” The growing preference for online deliveries -spurred by the pandemic -has not only hit the hawkers’ pockets, but also undermined their autonomy, which is important to hawkers who are, after all, business owners who want to be able to control and steer their business, said psychologist Praveen Nair. Pointing out that hawkers are used to operating independently -they take matters into their own hands by working hard and making good food, so as to make more money – Mr Nair said: “Imagine how difficult things might be for someone who likes to take things into their own hands when this needs to come to an end because of the pandemic.” “Suddenly, they are at the mercy of Grab, foodpanda, government handouts, and other platforms that they may not know about. “Nobody wants to depend on another person’s decision. If you go to Grab, they can suddenly change the margins of the price, whereas in the past, hawkers would have the mental concept that everything is in their power – their rental, their cleaning fees, etc,” said Mr Nair, who is from Raven Counselling and Consultancy. The commission rates that delivery companies Deliveroo, foodpanda and GrabFood charge their F&B merchant partners are at around 30 per cent. One year since the pandemic, why do users, riders and restaurants alike still have complaints about food delivery apps? A business professor and a ride-hailing appfounder weigh in on CNA\\'s Heart of the Matter podcast: THE DIGITAL DIVIDE The fear of losing control aside, many hawkers also have to deal with another major challenge: Digital technology, which entails some basic competence in logic and literacy – much to the horror of those who only received some primary school education, typical of the older generation of hawkers. There are those who are keen to adapt, such as long-time hawkers Arthur Wong, 75, and his wife Loh Mei Ling, 70. With business at only 10 per cent of what it was pre-COVID-19, the couple is now a lot more receptive to technology than before, given that the pandemic is unlikely to blow over anytime soon. They were entertaining the thoughts of joining WhyQ and starting a Facebook page for their hawker stall, Chinatown Sun Seng Gourmet’s Corner, which sells dishes such as fried rice, hor fun and sliced fish mee hoon. Their business started as a roadside stall in Chinatown before it was moved into the Chinatown Complex in 1983. But despite being a little more digitally savvy than other 70-year-olds, knowing how to watch shows on video streaming sites such as Netflix or browse Facebook, the couple still had their reservations. With WhyQ, Mr Wong said he was afraid that he would not know how to use the system, and might even mess up processes if he and his wife have to manage on-demand delivery orders while taking orders from the walk-in crowd simultaneously. They don’t have a stall helper. His immediate neighbour, Rice Bowl Boys, which is on WhyQ, Deliveroo and GrabFood, has offered to help in case they have teething problems, but Mr Wong doubts that he could remember everything that would be taught to him. “It is very hard for us to learn from the young, although the young might find it easy to learn from the old. They ‘run’ so fast, how to learn from them?” he quipped. When it comes to starting a Facebook page, Mr Wong is worried that he might not have the time and effort to keep people updated all the time. In the end, the semi-retired couple pushed aside those digital thoughts for now, and decided to extend their operational hours by one-and-a-half hours to 6pm to see if more people would patronise the stall. Mr Yeo Cheng Poh, 74, and Madam Toh Bong Chee, 73, who sell S$3 char kway teow and carrot cake at their stall, Fried Kuay Teaw Mee, at Seah Im Food Centre in the Harbourfront area, had also resorted to working longer hours to make up for the shortfall in income. Mdm Toh said they are at their stall at 7.30am and close it after 8.30pm daily, with no rest days. Asked if they had thought about going on delivery platforms, Mdm Toh said that the only mobile phone they have is an “old man’s phone” -a Samgle-brand keypad phone - which they mainly use to call suppliers. Another hawker, Ms Deng of Zhao Ji Claypot Rice, said it took her four months to learn the English words making up the dishes that her stall offers – including words like “skating chicken”, “bacon”, “sausage” and “salted fish” – before she could take orders properly through Facebook, via her stall’s page which her son and his girlfriend had helped set up. All she replies when she sees an order is “Ok”. Mr Calvin Sim was surprised when he found out a month ago that his 73-year-old father -Mr Sim Ah Tee who runs Ah Tee Ko Ko Mee at Jalan Berseh -had been using his own savings to cover the losses he had incurred during last year’s circuit-breaker. The 49-year-old central kitchen assistant said that his father -a hawker for more than 50 years - had always said “so-so lorh” whenever he was asked about how business was going at his stall due to the pandemic. It was only when the latest dining-in restrictions began that his father told Mr Sim of the true situation -he could not afford to cover the losses anymore, and wanted to close his stall permanently. “I know he wants to continue his business but it\\'s tough when savings are low,” Mr Sim said, who had shared his father’s story on the Hawkers United – Dabao 2020 Facebook group on May 15 to rally support for his business. The older Mr Sim did not benefit from any digitisation efforts as he is illiterate and can only speak Hokkien and a bit of Mandarin. For 19-year-old student Lim Hui Yi, although her parents’ hawker business, Pho 99 Vietnamese Delight at Telok Ayer Street, is on GrabFood, being on the delivery platform has not been helpful as their profit margins are very low, and they sometimes earn nothing at all, she said. Her parents, Mr Lim Heng Lee, 49, and Ms Bou Dalis, 45, who speak limited English and are not digitally savvy, make losses sometimes too when customers report receiving the wrong order. In such cases, Grab would refund those customers the amount that they had paid for their original order, so her parents would receive less money for the food delivered. Ms Lim would then have to step in to send Grab an appeal for the refunded order. She also regularly helps her parents post shoutouts on the Hawkers United — Dabao 2020 Facebook group, which has close to 300,000 members. BRIDGING THE DIVIDE As the urgency grows to bridge Singapore’s digital divide amid the ongoing pandemic, Singapore Management University sociology professor Paulin Straughan said society’s first mistake is to look at education as the “magic wand that solves everything”. “We give the elderly the hardware, and the information download which is often heavy. And we expect the elderly to make the link and connection between the two,” she said. But a more hands-on approach to familiarisation, in dealing with hawkers requiring immediate help to onboard smoothly onto the platform and tweak their operations accordingly, would be a better approach. “Have proper infrastructure to support them. Have a good help source (hotline number, for example),” Prof Straughan said. Assoc Prof Tan Ern Ser, from the National University of Singapore’s (NUS) Sociology department, suggested designing apps catered for those without a basic level of literacy, pointing out that these would preferably feature no text-only icons, with highly visible symbols and few steps. It would also help if hawkers can organise their menu into different sets, A, B or C, with no complicated configurations, he said. NUS senior lecturer Natalie Pang Lee San said it may be useful to consider community-based approaches to support elderly hawkers to digitise their businesses. This can be done by incentivising fellow elderly hawkers who have successfully digitised their businesses to mentor and impart working knowledge to others, she said. However, Singapore University of Social Sciences’ economist Walter Theseira said policymakers should be careful about pushing all forms of digitalisation on business. He pointed out that some of them offer very little benefit to these hawkers at present. For example, he cited the push for e-payment. “Their customers all carry cash. The hawkers are used to operating with cash and transact with their suppliers with cash. Their job frankly is not made any easier on a day-to-day basis by accepting e-payments. So why should they be asked to?” he said. “There must be real benefits, from being able to access more customers, or reduce costs of cash management. Otherwise, this is an example of adopting a technology that offers no benefit and poses great learning cost, especially if a hawker fails to get paid.” WHY FOOD DELIVERY PLATFORMS NOT FOR ALL While being listed on food delivery platforms is likely to bring hawkers some real benefits, the learning cost for an elderly hawker who is not digitally savvy might be too high, said Assoc Prof Theseira. In order to gain a reasonable business following online, the hawkers would have to learn things such as how to make their offerings more attractive to an online audience, and how to do digital marketing, he noted. Although there are some success stories involving older hawkers, they usually involve an interested party, such as a younger relative, who cares enough to help them. “I don\\'t think we can expect the elderly hawkers to do all this themselves, and I don\\'t think commercial services to help them make sense,” said Assoc Prof Theseira. Mr Jonathan Lim, founder and chief executive officer of Oddle, which helps restaurants build their own online ordering systems, said that not all hawkers can benefit from being on food delivery platforms, as delivery is really a “premium service”. Oddle charges merchants a 10 per cent platform fee, and there would be another delivery fee component set by its logistics partners Lalamove, GrabExpress, Zeek, and Pandago, which is more like a taxi meter charge. “For it to make business sense, the business owner has to make enough to want to deliver to you because you’d order enough, or the customer got to pay a large enough premium. But there seems to be a disconnect in the market right now,” he said. That’s why not many hawkers are on Oddle, Mr Lim said, as the basket size for food such as chicken rice and char kway teow would be too small to justify a delivery. Agreeing, Mr Seetoh, founder of Makansutra, which publishes street food guides, said the issue lies more with hawkers being unable to afford going digital, rather than older hawkers being unable to digitalise. “Hawker profits, because of their low margins, hover around 12 to 15 per cent. So in the world of common logic, how can anybody afford a 30 per cent commission, unless they are selling big-ticket items, and they have expensive sets? “So you see, not just the old, who are not online. A lot of people just can’t afford to be online … they don’t know how to do sponsored posts, they don’t know how to hit you directly. So sometimes I feel this digital culture we are embarking on, especially to the hawkers, is leaving a lot of people behind,” Mr Seetoh said. Not many people would pay a delivery premium for a bowl of noodles costing S$5, noted Mr Au Yee Yang, 33, the hawker behind Soon Ji Ban Mian at Chinatown Complex. His stall typically receives one to two orders in two weeks via Grab, and two to three orders in a week via foodpanda. HELP FROM GOVERNMENT, DELIVERY FIRMS Amid the pandemic last year, hawkers were able to tap the Self-Employed Person Income Relief Scheme (SIRS), which handed out a total of S$9,000 over nine months. They also benefited from rental waivers and subsidies for table-cleaning and centralised dishwashing services. On top of that, there was a one-time funding of S$500 for cooked food stallholders operating in hawker centres managed by the National Environment Agency (NEA) or NEA-appointed operators to engage food delivery platforms to deliver food to their customers. This time round, while there is no more SIRS, the Ministry of Finance announced on Friday that hawkers would be part of the group of workers who will receive additional one-off support under the COVID-19 Recovery Grant (Temporary). NEA will also waive rentals again while fully subsidising table-cleaning and centralised dishwashing services. According to NEA,last year’s funding assistance had benefited more than 1,300 hawkers, including some 500 hawkers aged 60 and above. Compared with last year, NEA noted that new forms of online food ordering services have emerged, and some of these services are available to hawkers with no commission fees, and do not require hawkers to use digital devices to process orders. There have also been recent ground-up initiatives to publicise hawkers who may require more support and patronage. NEA said it has worked with hawkers’ associations and other stakeholders to spread the word on the options available. “We are mindful that some hawkers may need more help to pivot, and will continue to provide the appropriate assistance through the respective hawkers’ associations,” it added. Meanwhile, Enterprise Singapore announced a food delivery booster package that will fund 5 percentage points of the commission cost charged by the three food delivery platforms — Deliveroo, foodpanda and GrabFood from May 16 to June 15. Separately, Grab had announced that it will provide full commission rebates for stall owners operating in NEA-managed hawker centres during the period of heightened alert. For other food outlets, it will give a 50 per cent rebate on commissions for more GrabFood orders as compared to their current level of sales or previous month\\'s sales. Foodpanda is also offering zero commission on delivery orders for hawkers operating in centres managed and regulated by NEA till June 13. A Grab spokesperson said that aside from reducing costs, it would be ramping up its marketing promotion efforts for hawkers and other smaller F&B outlets. Grab is also expanding the list of hawker centres on its Hawker Centre 2.0 programme, which lets consumers mix and match orders from multiple stalls within the same hawker centre and pay just one delivery fee, the spokesperson said. Grab said the programme now has close to 400 hawker merchants from 50 hawker centres, and the participating hawkers had observed an overall increase in their number of GrabFood orders since the programme was introduced last year. Foodpanda said it is supporting hawkers by offering free mix-and-match delivery for hawker centre orders with a minimum order value of S$35 from now until further notice. “This makes it easier for families to order together.The initiative also helps support individual stalls within the hawker centre, as customers will be more incentivised to order from more stalls to save on delivery fees,” its spokesperson said. Deliveroo said it continues to work closely with all restaurants and hawkers to understand their concerns and how best to support them during this period. COMMUNITY EFFORTS Just like during last year’s circuit breaker, Singapore’s various food-related online spaces are once again abuzz with rallying calls to help hawkers in need, be they in the form of photo posts, bulk group buys or Facebook Live shoutouts. Many new initiatives have also popped up to consolidate lists of hawkers who are not on the delivery space to let netizens discover them. One of them is the Oldie Hawker Pickups Google Form, started by marketing consultant Melissa Koh, 40. Collecting over five days the details of hawker stalls that could have fallen under the radar as their owners might not be tech-savvy, she released on May 26 the user-generated list that contained more than 160 entries of hawkers who are not on any delivery platforms. Another pair of netizens had started a similar initiative by coming up with a Google map of these spots, and Ms Koh has since appended it to the list as well, so that people can search for the hawkers by their exact locations. Ms Koh saidshe wanted to help the struggling hawkers build an online footprint, after reading about them on Facebook posts and finding that the existing efforts to help them were too scattered. Her initiative is also a movement against the increasingly high costs of food deliveries as well. “People do want options. This shows that we don’t need delivery services to increase sales,” she said: “When ordering food from apps, you don’t really know where your food comes from anymore. We see the cheapest delivery, we just buy.” Another effort is a Telegram bot called @SaveTheHawkersBot, which helps match people who are physically buying food from the hawker centre with other consumers living nearby who are looking for someone to help them buy food from the same hawker centre as well. Social media executive Jocelyn Ng, 24, also started an Instagram page, @wheretodapao, to capture the stories of the elderly-run hawker stalls. Just a week since its inception on May 21, the page already has a strong following of 28,900 accounts. It allows users to send in pictures and stories of their favourite hawkers through a Google Form. Ms Ng said that the elderly hawkers whom she has interacted with have “kind hearts, care for their community, are very understanding and have a selfless attitude”. “If we don’t give them our support, it might discourage them from helping us preserve their traditional way of cooking,” she said. Ambassador-at-Large Tommy Koh once remarked that the hawker centre “saved Singapore” as it is one place ordinary Singaporeans can go to have a good meal at an affordable price. Heoffered a simple suggestion: Attach young IT-savvy volunteers to the older hawkers to grant them the help that they need. Prof Koh said: “My wife and I still go to the markets and hawker centres. We patronise the older hawkers who are not active online. I urge Singaporean to join me in supporting them through this difficult period.” Mr Seetoh had written a viral Facebook post earlier this month that called on Singaporeans to “patronise these silent sufferers”, many of whom “are not online nor on anything except a prayer and hope”. Reiterating his message, Mr Seetoh said: “If you feel that this hawker food culture of ours deserves longevity so that your children, your grandchildren, who won’t be millionaires down the road, can still afford to eat cheap and affordable hawker food, then start doing something now. “Otherwise, if you don’t do your part now, your grandchildren in the future would tell you: ‘Ah gong ah, you knew that the food culture was dying and you knew people love it. Why didn’t you do anything to help them preserve this?

       " {'text': 'cleaners wages rise from 2023 progressive wage model 14964834 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners The base wages of cleaners who are Singaporeans or permanent residents will go up each year over six years under the progressive wage model. SINGAPORE: The wages of cleaners will go up each year over six years from 2023, after proposals by theTripartite Cluster for Cleaners (TCC) were accepted by the Government on Monday (Jun 7). Under the progressive wage model (PWM), the base salaries of cleaners who are Singaporeans or permanent residents will go up to betweenS$1,570 andS$2,210 in 2023. The amount will increase by at least S$170 each year until 2028. A full-time general or indoor cleaner, for instance, will qualify for a monthly salary of S$1,570 in July 2023. This is after a pay rise of S$258 - a nearly 20 per cent increase from the recommended salary of S$1,312 in 2022. In comparison, the PWM recommended annual increments from Jul 1, 2020 to Jun 30, 2023 was 3 per cent a year. The base pay of cleaners has risen gradually over the years and is now at S$1,236. It is due to rise to S$1,274 this July and to S$1,312 in July 2022 under the PWM. With the new wage adjustments, other categories of workers like restroom cleaners and healthcare cleaners will have to be paid at least S$1,795. Higher-skilled workers such as supervisors and mechanical drivers will have a wage floor of S$2,210. The move is expected to benefit about 40,000 resident cleaners employed by more than 1,500 cleaning businesses. \"This is a timely and necessary review to recognise the importance and higher value of work shouldered by our cleaners, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic,\" said TCC and theNational Trades Union Congress (NTUC) in a joint media release on Monday. The progressive wage model is designed to raise the salaries of lower-wage workers byupgrading their skills and increasing their productivity. Since 2014, it has been a licensing condition for cleaning companies. According to NTUC,a survey conducted late last year found that nearly all respondents indicated that the job of cleaners has become more important, and 95 per cent said they should be paid more. This is also the first wage review that takesreference from the Tripartite Workgroup on Lower-Wage Workers’ objective to ensure that wage growth is “ambitious enough to close the gap with workers earning median wages”. The workgroup was launched in October last year to review the salaries of low-wage workers and improve their well-being. Its goals include ensuring that wage increases in sectors covered by the progressive wage model continue to outpace median wage growth, as well asexpanding the number of occupations covered by the progressive wage model. Singapore’s median wage in 2020 was S$4,534. “In this pandemic, most of our workers, or cleaners are out there onthe frontline ... we really need to show a commitment and our gratitude for what they\\'ve done, keeping Singapore safe,\"said Member of Parliament Mohd Fahmi Aliman (PAP-Marine Parade), who is a member of the workgroup. \"I strongly urge all stakeholders to play a part in ensuring that our essential services workers in the environmental service industry can work with dignity.\" MORE TRAINING REQUIREMENTS BEYOND 2025 It was also announced on Monday that training guidelines requiring cleaners to get at least two Workforce Skills Qualification (WSQ) Certificates in Environmental Cleaning Modules or the equivalent have to be met by December next year. “This will help cleaners ensure their personal safety when carrying out cleaning tasks, especially with the increased cleaning demands and standards brought on by COVID-19,” said TCC and NTUC. Beyond 2025, the number of WSQ modules general cleaners need to complete will be increased to three, while those in higher job rungs must complete four modules. Chairman of the TCC and NTUC assistant director-general Zainal Sapari saidthe proposed wage ladder comes after extensive consultations with industry stakeholders. He said the six-year schedule of increases provides greater certainty to service providers and service buyers to price and award cleaning contracts. The\"aggressive wage increase\" not only reflects the value of the work cleaners do, it also attempts to narrow the gap between their wages and the salaries of other workers, said Mr Zainal. When asked if there was a target percentage of the median wage that cleaners\\' pay should eventually be pegged to, he said that this is \"premature\" but that the aim is for the annual wage increase to be higher than the median annual hike so that the wage gap can be narrowed. According to NTUC, with the new wage schedule, the compound annual growth rate of a general cleaner\\'s pay will be 10.7 per cent from 2023 to 2028. From Ministry of Manpower (MOM) statistics, the annualised total wage change in Singapore from 2014 to 2019 was4.1 per cent. \"We want to attract a younger workforce into thisindustry. We want this to be a possible career that theycan consider, compared togoing into the gig economy,\"Mr Zainal added. President of theEnvironmental Management Association of Singapore (EMAS), Mr Tony Chooi, said he hopes that being a cleaner will not be a \"job of last resort\". \"We are trying all ways to see how we are able to build the industry into something that is more attractive,\" he said. Responding to another questionon whether the higher wages will result in cleaning companies turning to more foreign workers, Mr Zainal said that this should not happen as the industry is regulated by the Dependency Ratio Ceiling which is essentially a quota for hiring Singaporean workers. TCC co-chair Jeffrey Chua, who represents the Singapore National Employers Federation (SNEF), said that with higher wage costs, service buyers should \"seriously consider\" outcome-based contracts rather than headcount based contracts, and invest in technology with cleaning companies to improve productivity. \"We also think short-term contracts will not encourage this behaviour.Hence, that\\'s why we have announced the six-yearrunway to allow service buyers and service providers to invest in technology,\" he said. The TCC includes representatives from SNEF, the labour movement, EMAS, service buyers and government agencies including MOM and the National Environment Agency (NEA). MOM, SkillsFuture Singapore, Workforce Singaporeand NEA said in a joint press release on Monday that the Government has accepted the recommendations for thesix-year schedule of wage increases and more mandatory training requirements. \"I am glad that many of us are more aware of the value of work our cleaners do. It is only apt that we recognise their contributions. Pandemic or not, uplifting the lives of our lower-wage workers matters to us,\" said NTUC secretary-general Ng Chee Meng in a Facebook post after the announcement.

       " {'text': 'jewel changi airport reopens 15 million support for workers 14993842 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners Jewel Changi Airport reopens to the public on Jun 14, but passenger terminals remain closed to allow the airport community to adapt to new zoning measures and safety protocols. SINGAPORE: The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) and the Changi Airport Group (CAG) will set aside S$15 million to help airport workers adjust to enhanced safety measures put in place after more than 100 COVID-19 cases were linked to the airport last month. About 5,000 workers will benefit from the S$15 million, which will be used to provide a monthly special allowance and cater meals for workers for six months, as well as defray the cost of personal protective equipment, they said. Last month Changi Airport became Singapore’s largest active COVID-19 cluster, with more than 100 cases, with CAAS and CAG saying at the time that preliminary investigations suggested that the initial transmission could have occurred through an airport worker who was \"assisting a family from South Asia\". Subsequently Changi Airport’s passenger terminals, as well as entertainment and retail complex Jewel, were closed to the public, while additional COVID-19 testing was introduced for arrivals from \\'very high-risk\\' countries and regions. In a media release on Friday (Jun 11), CAAS and CAG said there have not been any new COVID-19 positive cases involving airport workers since May 20. “Of the 43 airport workers who had tested positive, 42 have been discharged and the remaining worker is recovering in a hospital general ward without oxygen supplementation,” they said. They added that they have been working closely with the Health Ministry and the airport community to “review and strengthen Changi Airport\\'s defences against the more transmissible COVID-19 variants”. Enhanced safety measures have been implemented to protect airport workers, travellers and the public, they said. “Cohorting arrangements for airport workers have been tightened through a zonal system to reduce the risk of cross infection,” they said. “In particular, airport workers in the passenger terminal piers, arrival immigration halls and baggage claim halls who have interactions with arriving and transfer passengers and therefore are at higher risk of exposure to the virus, are now required to remain in their work zone throughout their shift, including during their meal and rest times,” they said. These workers are also required to be in “higher levels” of PPE throughout the duration of their shifts, except for meal and rest times. Deep cleaning and disinfection of Changi Airport\\'s passenger terminal buildings and Jewel Changi Airport have been completed, while an enhanced segregated zoning system announced last month has been implemented, said CAAS and CAG. “Airport workers have been briefed and trained on the new measures and requirements, to allow the new measures and safety protocols to be implemented smoothly,” they said, noting there would also be regular reminders, checks and audits on health safety as an “added safeguard”. “The safety of our airport workers remains our top priority. We are therefore supportive of the tightened measures to ensure they are protected in the course of their work,” said National Trades Union Congress deputy secretary-general Cham Hui Fong. “Our unions will continue to work closely with the relevant stakeholders to mitigate any impact on them, and to ensure their wellbeing is taken care of,” she added. JEWEL TO REOPEN ON JUN 14 Jewel, which has been closed to the public since May 13, will reopen on Jun 14. Changi Airport\\'s passenger terminals will remain closed to the public to allow the airport community to adapt to the new zoning measures, which require “significant operational adjustments”, saidCAAS and CAG. More details on the reopening of the passenger terminals will be released at a later date, they said. Since May 23, airport workers in higher risk roles have had to take an additional antigen rapid test (ART) between their seven-day polymerase chain reaction-based rostered routine tests. CAG and CAAS said that since Jun 3, it has been testing the use of the TracieX breathalyser, which allows workers to blow into a disposable breathalyser fitted with a proprietary sensor chip instead of undergoing an ART. TracieX was given provisional authorisation by the Health Sciences Authority on May 27. “The breathalyser will then be inserted into a portable reading device for vibrational spectroscopy analysis, which will be able to tell if a person is infected with COVID-19 within two minutes,” said CAG and CAAS. This will allow workers to receive their results faster than with the current ART, they said, adding that workers would also experience less discomfort as the test is non-invasive. “We aim to progressively replace the ART for more airport workers with the TracieX breathalyser in the coming months. This will also allow us to step up the frequency of testing so that we can more quickly detect, isolate and treat any potential COVID-19 cases in the airport community,” they said. Transport Minister S Iswaran, who visited Changi Airport on Friday, described the new breathalyser test as a “potential game changer” due to its method of administration. “We will gradually be scaling up the use of this breathalyser to validate its efficacy, and to be able to then scale up its use for a much wider range of workers,” he said, noting workers had told him the new test was a welcome alternative to the more invasive PCR and ART tests. REOPENING TRAVEL When asked about comments made by South Korean authorities that the country planned to expedite travel bubble plans with Singapore, Mr Iswaran said Singapore was “engaging in dialogue with many potential partners”. To allow for cross-border travel, key elements - such as mutual recognition of vaccinations and testing protocols - need to be in place, he said. Meanwhile the enhanced safety measures allow the airport to adapt more quickly to emerging risks, he said, describing these measures as an important part of Singapore\\'s \"overall posture towards a calibrated and safe reopening of travel\". “Once we have those elements in place then, at the appropriate time, when the ambient conditions are there, we can then activate that plan and mobilise the airlines and other partners to facilitate the kind of cross-border travel that we want to achieve.” Downloadourappor subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

       " {'text': 'jobs support scheme covid 19 phase 2 rental retail gyms 14903738 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: More sectors affected by the latest COVID-19 restrictions will getwage subsidies under the Jobs Support Scheme, Finance Minister Lawrence Wong said on Friday (May 28). Mr Wong, who is also co-chair of the COVID-19 multi-ministry task force, said the toughened measures have helped combata spike in communitycases. \"Our assessment is that the measures are working and they are having an effect in controlling the spread of the virus,\" he said.There is no need for stricter restrictions, he added. Singapore entered Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) on May 16 amid rising COVID-19 community cases. The tightened restrictions are to last untilJun 13. Group sizes for gatherings have been cut to two people, and dining-in at all F&B outlets banned. People should also work from home by default during this period. When the measures were announced on May 14, the Government raised the Jobs Support subsidy for F&B businesses from 10to 50 per cent for salaries paid up to June 2021. The scheme provides subsidies to companies for the first S$4,600 of gross monthly wages paid to local employees. The 50 per cent wage support has now been extended to sectors and businesses where many, if not all, of their operations are suspended during the period of heightened alert. This includes gyms, fitness studios, performing arts organisations, and arts education centres. The Jobs Support subsidy replaces an operating grant for gyms and fitness studios earlier announced. Sectors that are not required to suspend operations but are significantly affected by the tightened measures will get wage subsidies of 30 per cent from May 16to Jun 13. These are businesses in the retail sector, affected personal care services, museums, art galleries, historical sites, cinemas, indoor playgrounds and other family entertainment centres.Some retailers like supermarkets, convenience stores and online retailers will not be eligible. The payout, based on wages paid between April and June this year, will be disbursed in September, said the Ministry of Finance (MOF). Companies that put local employees on mandatory no-pay leave or retrench them will not be eligible for Jobs Support payouts for those employees. “I would encourage businesses to make full use of the enhanced JSS to retain and pay their workers during this period, and to use the lull period to invest in workers through training and upskilling programmes,\" said Mr Wong. RENTAL SUPPORT Small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and eligible non-profit organisations (with revenue of S$100 million or less) on certain commercial propertieswill also receive rental relief. These include businesses atproperties like hotels, serviced apartments, MICE venues, ferry terminals or cruise centres, tourist attractions, cinemas, schools, health or medical buildings and cinemas. Government-owned commercial properties will get one month of rental relief for qualifying tenants.Tenants will be required to pass down the rental relief received to qualifying sub-tenants, if any. Someprivately owned commercial properties have given rental waivers or rebates to tenants, said MOF.To provide additional support, the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore will disburse half a month ofrental relief in cash to qualifying tenants as part of a new Rental Support Scheme.The payout will be disbursed starting from mid-August. Those who run an SME business or non-profit organisation on their own property will also be eligible for the cash payout. Hawkers and coffee shop stallholders who are tenants of government agencies are already getting one month of rental waiver. Authorities also encouraged commercial landlords to “support their F&B tenants through this period”. Fees for table-cleaning and centralised dishwashing services have also been waived for around 6,000 cooked food stallholders in hawker centres managed by the National Environment Agency or appointed operators. Mr Wong also announced help for people suffering from income loss in the form of a one-off grant. Those who have been put on at least one month of involuntary no-pay leave or have suffered income loss of at least 50 per centfor at least one month between May 16and Jun 30 may apply for the grant. The package of support measures will cost the Government S$800 million, which will be fundedthrough reallocation from development expenditure. Mr Wong said that the package is \"not of the same scale\" as previous support measures as most parts of the economy are still operating. \"Our circumstances todayare very different compared to last year. And under such a circumstance, I don\\'t think we should be going to the President to seek permission to draw on our past reserves,\" he said. \"In fact, we must expect to run into situations like these from time to time, where we experience an occasional outbreak of cases in our community, and we will then need to tighten restrictions temporarily to control the spread of the virus. \"So we will have to learn to adapt to such situations, using our own resources rather than to dip into our past reserves.\" The Government does not expect to require an additional draw on past reserves at this point, said MOF. Mr Wong will table a Supplementary Supply Bill at the next Parliament sitting in Julyfor the reallocation.

       " {'text': 'covid 19 threatens slow female leadership workplace boardroom 14927722 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: The COVID-19 pandemic could affect female leadership in the workplace and boardrooms, according to an online panel discussion hosted by BoardAgender, an initiative by the Singapore Council of Women’s Organisations (SCWO) on Tuesday (Jun 1). The one-hour panel discussion on board diversity was held in conjunction with the 30% Club, a global initiative led by chairpersons and CEOs to increase gender diversity at board and senior management levels. The panel discussion was attended by more than 200 people. “During COVID, around the world, women have been bearing the (burden of) educating their kids at home more than men have. Even female professors are publishing less papers than male professors right now because of this sort of family burden,” said Ms Ann Cairns, executive vice chair at Mastercard. \"What that’s highlighted is that we haven’t solved childcare globally. What I think you can do is you can look at it inside your own organisation and you can look at it inside your own country, and decide what you\\'re going to do to create some sort of level playing field for men and women about this,\" Ms Cairns added. Ms Cairns, who was one of the panellists, highlighted Mastercard’s maternity and paternity leave in more than 200 countries that gives employees four months of full-paid leave. “As a manager, you’re not looking at a young woman thinking she’s going to have a baby. You’re looking at a person thinking they’re going to be a parent. That changes the playing field right away,” she said. Having things such as emergency childcare in place, she added, would ease the burden for parents, as they know that they can still do their job even if their support “disappears”. “We could go backwards this year. It’s up to companies and governments to think what they need to do to start to arrest that regression,” she said. FROM DIVERSITY TO INCLUSION It is also important that diversity at senior management level isn\\'t just a PR exercise, but affects fundamental decisions, noted the panellists. “We know that if there’s only one woman at the board table, it’s difficult for her to be heard. If there’s two, it gets better. But if there’s 30 per cent women, you get a different lens and conversation,” said Ms Nicola Wakefield Evans, chair of the 30% Club in Australia. “You need to have a minimum of 30 per cent, with an aspiration to get to 40 or even 50 per cent. That’s where change comes, and you get decisions being made from different perspectives,” she said. The whole philosophy behind the “30 per cent” rule of thumb, added Ms Cairns, is that “you stop being a minority”. “It’s not just the boardroom you have to worry about. It’s what your employees look like, what communities you’re serving, what you\\'re actually saying to your customers out in the markets,” she added. However, “diversity for diversity\\'s sake” might not always work, especially when there’s a need to balance diversity with “domain knowledge”, said Mr Piyush Gupta, CEO of DBS Group. “When you look for diversity, I think what you’re looking for is life experience. Finding what forms your views; it’s a function of how and where you grew up. To me, the most important thing is to figure out how to get people with a diversity of life and job experiences,” he added. Asked what a gender inclusive workplace looks like, Ms Wakefield Evans said it’s ultimately “a safe place”. “It’s a feeling that someone can bring their whole person to work … but also providing the same opportunity for everybody to be advanced, assessed, promoted, and paid,” she added. DIVERSITY DRIVES THE BOTTOM LINE Diversity can also affect a company’s profits, the panellists said. “The data is out there to look at, and that’s what investors are looking at when they say, we want change because we think it will make the companies perform better and be more sustainable,” said Ms Cairns. She added that women make up half the human race, and about half the university cohort in many countries. “What kind of leaders would we be if we said we were going to choose people from half the graduating class? None of us are doing that at the entry level. And yet, we’re doing that at the top of companies,” she said. Getting investors more engaged with the diversity agenda is another crucial step, added Mr Gupta. He also noted that he does not like the term “allyship”, which has been used to refer to men in the boardroom supporting female leadership. “Allies can be supporters. We need sponsors. We need people who are willing to take an active role in participating and pushing the agenda,” he said. The panel discussion was part of BoardAgender’s 10th anniversary this year. Later this month, BoardAgender will also roll out an inaugural mentorship programme for aspiring women directors, where 10 “board-ready women” will be mentored by 10 seasoned board directors for six months.

The situation in Africa, where new infections and deaths jumped by nearly 40 per cent last week compared to the previous week, is \"so dangerous\" as the Delta variant spreads globally, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. \"Our world is failing, as the global community we are failing,\" he told a news conference. Tedros, who is Ethiopian, chastised unnamed countries for reluctance to share doses with low-income countries. He compared it to the HIV/AIDS crisis, when some argued that African nations were unable to use complicated treatments. \"I mean that attitude has to be a thing of the past,\" Tedros said. \"The problem now is a supply problem, just give us the vaccines.\" \"The difference is between the haves and the have nots which is now completely exposing the unfairness of our world - the injustice, the inequality, let\\'s face it,\" he said.

Based on the latest scientific evidence, the vaccination guidelines for pregnant and breastfeeding women, cancer patients on treatment and individuals with history of Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions (SCAR) have been updated. To further encourage vaccination for seniors, all Vaccination Centres in the community will now accept walk-ins for those aged 60 and above. Updates on Vaccination Programme With more people vaccinated both locally and globally, there is more evidence on the efficacy and safety of vaccine use especially in relation to various sub-groups. The Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination (EC19V) has revised the guidance for the following: Pregnant Women There is currently no evidence to suggest that the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines may cause harm to the mother or child. As there is less data available for pregnant women, pregnant women should discuss with their doctors to make an informed decision. Pregnant women can register and book an appointment from 4 June 2021 onwards. Breastfeeding Women It is safe for breastfeeding women to be vaccinated. There is no need to suspend breastfeeding to receive the BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. Cancer Patients on Active Treatment Remain a vulnerable population that is at an increased risk of complications from COVID-19. Currently no evidence of any safety signals or increased rates of adverse events from mRNA-based vaccines. Can be vaccinated only in a hospital setting*, after assessment by their treating specialists on their suitability. *Cancer patients on hormonal treatment can continue to be vaccinated at vaccination sites.

Polyclinics will not be able to accept walk-ins due to their limited capacity.Vaccination Plans for the Rest of the PopulationVaccination for students in schools and Institutes of Higher Learning will begin, starting from 1 June 2021. If supplies continue to arrive as scheduled, vaccination should be open to young adults aged 39 years and below in the middle of June.As this is a large group, Singapore Citizens will be invited to register their interest and make appointments two weeks before bookings are opened to others in this age group. Special Access Route (SAR) for VaccinesMOH has currently authorised two vaccines – Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. There has been interest to access alternate vaccines, mostly due to medical reasons which prevent individuals from taking the two authorised vaccines. However, there have either been no applications for approval of these alternate vaccines, or evaluation is still on-going.To provide even more flexibility, MOH will open up access to other COVID-19 vaccines under the Special Access Route (SAR) through the private healthcare sector. The SAR allows for the import and supply of unregistered medicines to address unmet medical needs, and can be used for the supply of vaccines approved by the World Health Organisation (WHO) to be on their Emergency Use Listing (EUL). The use of such vaccines should be according to the WHO EUL-approved indications and age groups. Those interested in the SAR should discuss with their doctors and make an informed decision. Patients will also need to sign an informed consent form to acknowledge that they have discussed with their doctor and accept all responsibility for the risks. The Government will not subsidise vaccines administered under the SAR, and persons vaccinated under the SAR will not be eligible for the Vaccine Injury Financial Assistance Programme for COVID-19 Vaccination (VIFAP). Contact tracing, testing and vaccination will continue to be key prongs of Singapore’s strategy to control the pandemic. Vaccination remains a key enabler in keeping our community safe and to allow us to re-open safely. Everyone is strongly encouraged to be vaccinated when it is offered to you.

       " {'text': 'watch out for misinformation about mrna and inactivated virus covid 19 vaccines Misleading social media messages have been claiming that the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines – authorised by the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) under the Pandemic Special Access Route (PSAR) – are unsafe and ineffective in protecting against COVID-19, including Variants of Concern (VOCs) such as the B16172 or “delta” variant.These messages also asserted that inactivated virus COVID-19 vaccines, like Sinovac, would provide superior protection, and should be offered to children instead.Let us examine the claims.Claim #1: mRNA vaccines are ineffective against COVID-19Both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines continue to be highly efficacious, with efficacy rate at around 90%. This has been established by the Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination (EC19V) based on their continual review of global and local data.These two vaccines are also especially effective in protecting against severe COVID-19 disease and hospitalisation.Claim #2: mRNA vaccines are useless in protecting us against COVID-19 mutationsThe mRNA vaccines are effective in protecting us against key VOCs, including the B16172 or “delta” variant. Studies in the UK demonstrated that two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine can provide around 80% protection against symptomatic COVID-19 infection with the delta variant. While further studies are required before drawing definitive conclusions, the available data globally indicates that substantial protection is preserved.The asymptomatic to mild infections detected locally with the delta variant in vaccinated persons is consistent with the global evidence that mRNA vaccines provides protection against symptomatic and severe disease.Claim #3 - mRNA vaccines are not safeThe mRNA vaccines have gone through rigorous evaluation by HSA and EC19V and have been assessed to be safe for use. They had been authorised by HSA under the Pandemic Special Access Route (PSAR) and included as part of our COVID-19 national vaccination programme. Like all vaccines, people who receive the COVID-19 vaccines may experience common side effects. Most of the side effects are mild or moderate, and usually get better within a few days. In very rare instances, persons may experience serious side effects, such as a severe allergic reaction to the mRNA vaccine (e.g., anaphylaxis). The currently available data also suggests that there may be a very small risk of myocarditis and pericarditis after the second dose of an mRNA vaccine, particularly in young men. However, these serious side effects are rare, and risks are mitigated with careful monitoring of symptoms and seeking medical attention early. Overall, the benefits of receiving the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, i.e., reduction in COVID-19 infections and severe complications even if infected, continue to outweigh the risks of vaccination. It is strongly recommended that medically eligible persons are vaccinated with them.Claim #4 - Inactivated virus vaccines, like Sinovac, can protect us better than mRNASinovac, an inactivated virus vaccine, has shown variable protection across multiple international studies. The most complete analysis of the vaccine showed a vaccine efficacy of 51%. The protection of Sinovac against newer variants, such as the delta variant, and under real-world conditions remains unknown.On the other hand, global and local data has shown that the PSAR-authorised mRNA vaccines are able to protect against COVID-19 and its variants by reducing the severity of symptoms.The Sinovac vaccine has yet to meet the requirements for PSAR authorisation. HSA is currently still waiting for the additional safety and quality data from Sinovac for evaluation.Claim #5 – Children should be given Sinovac since the vaccine technology has proven to be safeWHO does not recommend the use of Sinovac in persons below age 18 years even though it is put under its Emergency Use Listing (EUL) Procedure. As such, this is currently not an option for children and adolescents globally nor in Singapore under the Special Access Route (SAR).On 18 May 2021, HSA endorsed the use of Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine in children between 12 to 15 years old. This decision was made after the careful assessment of the safety and efficacy data from the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for persons of this age group. We advise members of the public not to speculate and/or spread misinformation.

       " {'text': \"covid 19 vaccination extended to singapore citizens aged 12 to 39 As of 23 June 2021, over 5 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine have been administered in Singapore, with 3 million individuals receiving at least their first dose. Updates on the Vaccination ProgrammeOn 24 June 2021, the Multi-Ministry Taskforce (MTF) announced the following updates to the national vaccination programme:1.Acceleration of National Vaccination Programme (NEW)From 26 June 2021, up to 80,000 daily doses of the vaccine will be administered - an increase from 47,000 in mid-June 2021 and 40,000 in May 2021. Another 500,000 new first dose appointments will be available for registration, with additional slots opening up in subsequent weeks.If supplies continue to arrive as planned, 2/3 of Singapore’s population will be fully vaccinated by National Day (9 August). MOH is also looking to reduce the current dose interval of between six to eight weeks, to four weeks. This will allow more of the population to complete their vaccination of two doses sooner. More details will be announced soon.2. Rest of the Population(NEW)From 2 July 2021, the national vaccination programme will be extended to the rest of the population, including Permanent Residents and long-term pass holders aged 12 to 39. Eligible individuals may register their interest for vaccination at vaccine.gov.sg.3. Singapore Citizens Aged 12 to 39 Years Old(UPDATED)The priority window for Singapore Citizens aged 12-39 years old has been extended by one week till 1 July 2021. This allows individuals more time to register and book slots, and receive an earlier vaccination appointment from the additional slots to be opened soon.Eligible individuals can register online for their COVID-19 vaccinations at vaccine.gov.sg. Children who turn 12 in 2021 must have crossed their birthday before they are eligible to book an appointment.Individuals who have already booked a slot for their first dose and have appointments in mid-to-end July 2021 are also encouraged to bring forward their appointments.An SMS with a personalised booking link to make an appointment will be sent within the next week for registrants who have yet to receive the SMS.Parental Consent Required for Persons Below 18 Years OldThose who are under the age of 18 will require the consent of their parent/guardian to book an appointment. The child will be required to bring along documentary proof of their consent to the vaccination site for verification.Parents/guardians of children/wards aged 13 and above are not required to accompany them to the vaccination site on the day of vaccination. However, children/wards aged 12 will need to be accompanied by a parent or guardian.4. Individuals who have recovered from an earlier infectionIndividuals who have recovered from an earlier COVID-19 infection are recommended to receive a single dose of vaccine. Evidence has indicated that a single dose would further boost their immunity against COVID-19.Individuals who had an earlier COVID-19 infection from over six months ago will be prioritised for the single-dose vaccination, as recovered individuals who have had infection within the past six months are likely to still have a strong immune response that has not faded.Eligible persons will be able to register from 11 June 2021 onwards, if they are part of a population group that is already eligible for vaccination.Vaccination remains a key enabler in keeping our community safe. Those who are medically eligible are strongly encouraged to be vaccinated when it is offered to you.For more information, view MOH's press releases below. 10 June 2021 - Maintaining Heightened Alert to Minimise Risk of Transmission As We Re-Open Safely 24 June 2021 - Updates on COVID-19 National Vaccination Programme\", 'id': '953371c2-118f-4696-9ab1-7ce645d08712', 'score': None, 'probability': None, 'question': None, 'meta': {'category': 'articles'}, 'embedding': None},\n",

This is part of the larger national effort to keep education institutions and the wider community safe. Vaccination roll-out for studentsBased on approval from the Health Science Authority (HSA) of the medical suitability of the vaccines, students below the age of 18 will only be offered the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, while students aged 18 and above can opt for either the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine. All eligible students can expect to receive their invitation to sign up for their vaccination from 1 June 2021. Graduating cohorts at the secondary schools and Pre-University levels, in particular students sitting for the GCE N-, O-, A- Level examinations in the second-half of 2021, will be the first to receive their invitations. This is to ensure they have greater flexibility in scheduling their vaccination appointments. Invitations will be progressively extended over the next two weeks to other groups of full-time students1in schools and IHLs, including the Privately-Funded Schools, Madrasahs and Special Education (SPED) schools. Medically eligible students can receive their vaccinations at the following locations: Community vaccination centres Four additional dedicated MOE vaccination centres. Three are jointly set-up by MOE and the Health Promotion Board (HPB) at ITE College campuses - ITE College Central, ITE College East and ITE College West. One is located at Raffles City Convention Centre. MOH will deploy mobile vaccination teams to SPED schools to carry out vaccinations for all SPED students aged 12 and above. The SPED schools will share the registration instructions and guidelines with students and parents/guardians.Conduct of Vaccination Exercise and Registration ProcessStudents above the age of 18 and parents/guardians of students below the age of 18 will receive SMSes with a unique link to book vaccination appointments at any of the vaccination centres. Those below the age of 18 will only be offered appointment slots at centres with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. The main vaccination exercise for most students will be through the National Appointment System as this will provide the maximum flexibility in terms of choice of date and venues. MOE will look into providing alternative arrangements for students who require additional support for vaccination when schools reopen, such as facilitating transport arrangements. Parental/Guardian Consent Students below the age of 18 will be required to seek parental/guardian consent as part of the vaccination appointment booking process through the National Appointment System. Consent given via this system will be collected once and will apply for both doses of the vaccine. Students aged 13 and above do not need to be accompanied by their parents/guardians to the vaccination centres. Parental/guardian accompaniment is only required for students aged 12 and SPED school students. For more information, click here for MOE’s press release. 1 In line with HSA’s approval of the use of COVID-19 vaccines in Singapore, SMS invites will only be sent to parents/guardians of children who are 12 years old as at 1 June 2021.

       " {'text': 'false message circulating on changes to treatment protocols A false message attributed to the Ministry of Health, Singapore has been circulating on messaging platforms. It claimed that following an autopsy on a COVID-19 patient, Singapore discovered that COVID-19 does not exist as a virus, but instead as a “bacterium that has been exposed to radiation and causes human death by coagulation in the blood”.The message also falsely claimed that the authorities had changed the treatment protocols for COVID-19, and instead gave aspirins to patients who tested positive for COVID-19.The allegations are all false and the message did not originate from the Ministry of Health, Singapore. Earlier versions of this message, citing countries such as Italy and Russia instead of Singapore, have been exposed as untrue. Here are the facts:Fact #1: Singapore did not perform such an autopsy on a COVID-19 patient nor made such claims about the pathophysiology of COVID-19 infection. There has also not been any such resultant change in our treatment protocols for COVID-19 patients.Fact #2: COVID-19 is caused by a virus, not a bacterium.Based on many scientific studies and current evidence, COVID-19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The World Health Organization (WHO) has also previously debunked the myth that COVID-19 is caused by bacteria, not a virus.Some people who are infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus may develop a bacterial infection as a complication – this is also seen in other viral illnesses such as influenza. In such cases, antibiotics may be prescribed.Fact #3: COVID-19 cannot be cured with aspirin.Aspirin has no direct effect on the virus that causes COVID-19.

       " {'text': 'pm lee the covid 19 situation in singapore 14 dec My fellow SingaporeansWe are coming to a full year since our first COVID-19 case.It has been a year of uncertainty, full of ups and downs, filled with anxiety and trepidation.But much has changed within the last few months. In March and April, we peaked at over 1,000 cases a day. Now, on most days we have zero cases of local transmissions. When the pandemic first started, we were worried if there would be enough supplies in the supermarkets. Today, supermarket shelves are full, and shopping is calm and uneventful. Parents were worried then whether their kids should go to school. But we kept the school year intact, CCAs have resumed, and graduating students have finished exams and are waiting for their results. We will not forget the two months of Circuit Breaker in April and May. But today, life is a lot more normal. We go to work, dine out, meet friends, though in groups no more than five.How did we bring things under control? It took a tremendous effort, and some good luck. Our measures were hard for everyone, but they worked. Singaporeans showed resilience and took them in their stride. Our economy took a big hit, but we did not let it crash. Despite the global economic dislocation, most of our workers kept their jobs.Now, our defences against COVID-19 are much stronger. We have steadily built up our testing capacities and procedures. We introduced Rostered Routine Testing of higher risk groups. We started using Antigen Rapid Tests, to resume larger gatherings and events safely. We also beefed up our contact tracing capabilities. For example, expanding our SafeEntry and TraceTogether programmes, and distributing TraceTogether tokens. We got used to the inconvenient restrictions and found ways to carry on with life. We looked after one another, reminding each other to adhere to safe distancing, to wear masks, to see a doctor if ill, and so on.I am very grateful that Singaporeans have complied with the spirit, and not just the letter of the rules. We stayed united, kept up our guard, and did not allow ourselves to become complacent over time. With everyone’s full support, our enhanced safeguards worked, and we could gradually ease our restrictions. We can be proud of how far we have come.Route to Phase 3Because of your efforts, we are now ready to progress to Phase 3. Phase 3 will begin in two weeks’ time, on 28 December, so we will end the year with some good news. The Ministerial Task Force will explain the details immediately after my broadcast. We will ease capacity limits in public places like malls and attractions, and at places of worship. One significant change is to allow groups of up to eight to congregate, up from the current maximum of five. So eight people can dine out together, or visit someone’s home. This will make it easier to hold family get-togethers during the festive period.Please understand that even as we enter Phase 3, the battle is far from won. The COVID-19 virus has not been eradicated. There is a long way to go. Around the world, the pandemic is still raging. Many countries are seeing second, third, or even fourth waves of infection, with record numbers of daily cases.International borders remain largely closed. But trade and travel are our lifeblood. The longer our borders stay closed to travellers, the greater the risk of us permanently losing out as an international hub, consequently hurting our livelihoods.Therefore, our only option is to re-open our borders in a controlled and safe manner. As we do so, we will see more imported cases. And there will be some risk of these cases spreading to the community. We already have had a few cases recently. An airport staff, who likely came into contact with infected passengers. A marine worker, who picked up the virus after boarding ships to do repair and resupply work. This is a calculated risk we have to accept. But the government will take every precaution and do our best to prevent imported cases from triggering a new outbreak.At the same time, Singaporeans must keep our guard up, because the virus is most likely still circulating silently within our community. This is absolutely not the time to relax and let our guard down, or to hold a big party, imagining that the problem has disappeared. Progressing from Phase 2 to Phase 3 is a calibrated, careful move. We are easing the restrictions in a controlled way, so that we can keep the COVID-19 situation stable and take more steps forward later. It is vital that you stay cautious and vigilant, continue to cooperate with the government, and comply with the rules and restrictions that will apply in Phase 3.Update on VaccinationsHow long will we have to keep this up for? It may be for quite a while, possibly a year or more. One key factor is how soon COVID-19 vaccines become available to us.The government has been working quietly behind the scenes, since early in the pandemic, to secure access to vaccines. This was not a simple exercise. More than 200 vaccine candidates were being developed, and not all would succeed.We started talking to the pharmaceutical companies early to understand the science and identify the promising candidates and the vaccines likely to reach production sooner.We have set aside more than $1 billion. We placed multiple bets, to sign advance purchase agreements and make early down-payments for the most promising candidates, including with Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech, and Sinovac. We made arrangements with pharmaceutical companies to facilitate their clinical trials and drug development in Singapore and attracted a few to establish vaccine manufacturing capabilities here. We also supported local efforts to develop a vaccine. This gave our own scientists and researchers the opportunity to do cutting edge work. It was also insurance in case the global supply chain was disrupted. This way, we built up a diversified portfolio of options, to ensure that Singapore would be near the front of the queue for vaccines, and not last in line.Securing early access to vaccines was a whole-of-government effort. Many agencies and public officers, led by the Head of the Civil Service, were involved in this critical mission. I commend them for their good work. They are among the legion of unsung heroes who have helped us get through this crisis.As you would have read the news, the first vaccines are now coming into production. I am very happy to tell you that after studying the scientific evidence and clinical trial data, the Health Sciences Authority has approved the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for pandemic use. The first shipment should arrive by the end of this month, making Singapore one of the first countries to obtain this vaccine. We also expect other vaccines to arrive in Singapore in the coming months. If all goes according to plan, we will have enough vaccines for everyone in Singapore by 3Q2021.MOH has set up a committee of doctors and experts to recommend a vaccination strategy for us. The committee has proposed that the entire adult population should be vaccinated, but to make vaccinations voluntary. First priority will be given to those who are at greatest risk: healthcare workers and frontline personnel, as well as the elderly and vulnerable. Thereafter, the committee proposes to progressively vaccinate the rest of the population, and to cover everyone who wants a vaccination by the end of next year.The Government has accepted these recommendations. I have personal confidence in our experts. My colleagues and I, including the older ones, will be getting ourselves vaccinated early. This is to show you, especially seniors like me, that we believe the vaccines are safe.We have decided to make vaccinations free for all Singaporeans, and for all long-term residents who are currently here. With more of us vaccinated, the harder it will be for the virus to spread, and the safer we will all be as a society.Vaccines will support our recovery in more ways than one. As a global aviation hub, we play a crucial role transporting vaccines around the world. Vaccines require cold chain management. An ordinary refrigerator is not good enough: the Pfizer vaccine needs to be stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius, colder than the Arctic in winter! This requires infrastructure, high standards, skilled personnel, and good connectivity to many different countries and all along the supply chain.Fortunately, Singapore has a strong ecosystem for cargo handling. Leading global logistics companies like DHL, UPS and FedEx are based here. SIA, and Changi Airport’s ground handling partners are certified by IATA (the International Air Transport Association) to handle and transport pharmaceutical supplies. We are now gearing ourselves up to handle large volumes of vaccine shipments into and through Singapore, to help win the global fight against COVID-19.We did not get here overnight. We have always planned ahead, systematically creating opportunities for ourselves. It took us years of investment and planning, building a business-friendly climate and expanding our air links around the world. These long-term investments are now paying dividends.ConclusionDuring this immediate crisis, we have reacted quickly and comprehensively, marshalled resources to solve our problems, and stayed resilient. Our situation is now stable, but only because everyone has worked so hard, and sacrificed so much. Now that vaccines are becoming available, we can see light at the end of the tunnel. As vaccinations become widespread not only in Singapore, but also in our region and the world, we can look forward to resuming more normal lives.Let us keep up our efforts in this final stretch, to cross the finish line together, and complete our mission to defeat COVID-19.Thank you.', 'id': '6d42a956-b192-4fb0-9b50-a976e605a05e', 'score': None, 'probability': None, 'question': None, 'meta': {'category': 'articles'}, 'embedding': None},\n",
       " {'text': \"experts explain covid 19 and safe management measures Curious how a swab test feels like, or wondered why we should still keep our social circles small even though safe distancing is not required on public transport?While some safe management measures may seem curious when compared to others, rest assured there is always a good reason behind each one.Hear the explanations straight from our three experts: Dr Janil Puthucheary, Senior Minister of State, Ministry of Communications and Information & Ministry of Health; Dr Koh Poh Koon, Senior Minister of State, Ministry of Health; and Assoc Prof Vernon Lee, Director (Communicable Diseases) at the Ministry of Health. 1.Is the swab test painful and must I pay for it?Dr Koh: If you're having symptoms like the flu and your doctor recommends you go for a swab test, you can have it done for free, at the Public Health Preparedness Clinics (PHPCs), the regional screening centres, and all government polyclinics.It's a simple swab test through the nose and takes less than 10 seconds - I've done it twice in the last two weeks. The swabs are actually much thinner than a cotton bud that you normally use and only goes in slightly more than where your fingers normally can reach. The only discomfort you feel would be the urge to sneeze. But before you can even sneeze, the test is done. So, do not be afraid to go for the swab test if your doctor recommends it.2.Can I lower my mask when sipping my drink while walking?Dr Janil: Well, I don't know how you can drink with a mask still on - you have to lower it to drink. But of course, put it back on again when you're done. More importantly, if it’s bubble tea, ask for less sugar, please. 3.Why should my colleagues and I stagger our lunch times when we share the same office space?Prof Vernon: There's a big difference between spending time in the office and going for lunch. In the office, most of the time, our masks are on and we are able to maintain good physical distance.Now, when we are dining with our colleagues, our masks are off most of the time. We are in much closer physical proximity, and we also tend to talk quite loudly in a social environment. So, it is very important then that we limit the number of colleagues that we go out for lunch with.It is also important for us to stagger our meal times, so that we can avoid overcrowding in our lunch venues.4.Are young children considered as pax when dining out?Prof Vernon: This is not quite like going to attractions, where young children can get in for free. Unfortunately with COVID-19, babies and young children are also susceptible to infection. That means that every individual must be counted towards the total number of people in a certain venue. 5.Why must we wear our masks when dining out with our family?Prof Vernon: So, can you imagine if you're drinking a cup of coffee, and someone walks past you and coughs or sneezes at you without a mask on, that would be extremely gross.Therefore, if you're not eating or drinking, please put on a mask to protect yourself and to also protect others.6.Why are only small groups allowed in makan places?Dr Koh: The virus spreads most effectively when the three V's coincide. What are they? Vocalisation - which is about talking, singing without your mask on, and spreading aerosols and droplets into the air. Volume of interaction - when people come close together and spend a long time together talking to one another. Venue - the type of settings where people come together, places like restaurants, pubs, nightclubs, where people interact in close proximity.So, when the three V's come together - it is a super spreader event, and the virus can spread very effectively. That's why we recommend that in a restaurant setting, the group size should be kept small and you should sit further apart. You should put on your mask when you finish eating, so that you keep yourself and others safe.7.Why must I keep my social circle small, when I squeeze with many others on public transport?Prof Vernon: There are several differences between taking public transportation and interacting with our close family and friends in our social circle.In our social circles, as we eat and drink, there are many times when the masks are off, when we are talking loudly and have very close interactions. These provide the opportunity for respiratory droplets to transmit COVID-19 to one another. Public transportation, on the other hand, is quite different. Although sometimes you're not able to maintain safe distancing, wearing a mask and refraining from talking will prevent the explosion of respiratory droplets.Also, when you leave the MRT or bus, please sanitise your hands to keep your hands clean. If we do all this, we would actually reduce the risk of COVID-19 spread to a very low level.The other thing that we all must remember to do is to use our TraceTogether App, or to carry the Token. This helps us to contact trace any COVID-19 case that might occur. 8.Can we stop wearing a mask if we practise social distancing?Prof Vernon: So, wearing a mask is actually one of the most important tools that prevent the spread of COVID-19.When we talk very loudly, or cough and sneeze, what happens is that respiratory droplets spread far and wide. The larger droplets may actually spread for about 0.4 metres before they drop to the ground, but very fine droplets might travel between one to two metres and linger around in the air for up to a minute. We put on a mask to prevent ourselves from getting infected by these droplets, and to prevent us from spreading disease to others. 9.If walking is my exercise, can I not wear a mask?Dr Koh: The rule is that once we get out of the house, we should put on the mask. Treat it as part of your wardrobe, because it protects you and protects others as well. If you're walking very briskly, and you start to feel breathless, it is probably alright to take the mask off for a short period of time. Once you feel comfortable, you should put it back on, to maintain the protection.Some seniors find that it's quite difficult to do strenuous exercises, and sometimes when they go out for a stroll or walk, they tend to feel breathless. In that case, for their own safety, it's probably alright to let the mask off for a little while. But remember, the protection must be on at all times If you're not feeling breathless. 11.Why must the SafeEntry and TraceTogether App/Token be used together?Dr Janil: Well, SafeEntry with the QR codes is about where we have been.TraceTogether is very different. It uses Bluetooth to check our proximity to other people. It's really about who we’re putting at risk when we’re sick. It's about protecting our loved ones. So, we need both to keep us all safe together.12.Why is the Stay-Home Notice duration different for some travellers?Dr Janil: There are three different ways in which we protect ourselves here in Singapore. For travellers from highest risk countries, they will be served a 14 day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) or quarantine because their risk is much higher than here in Singapore. For those from countries where things are improving, they serve a seven-day SHN, with COVID-19 swabs, of course. For other places, where their numbers are pretty much the same as ours, or even lower, the risk is low, about the same as going from Jurong to Punggol. So, we just ask them to do a COVID-19 swab test when they arrive in Singapore.This article is part of our #WhyAh series that explores the “Why’s” behind our COVID-19 safe management measures.\", 'id': 'ce70c81e-da99-424f-b94a-0f10134fb47a', 'score': None, 'probability': None, 'question': None, 'meta': {'category': 'articles'}, 'embedding': None},\n",
       " {'text': 'additional restrictions under phase 2 heightened alert Further Restrictions Under Phase 2 (Heightened Alert)Over the past two weeks several clusters of infections have emerged, coupled with a pattern of local unlinked community cases. These developments have demonstrated higher attack rates and secondary transmission occurs in “mask-off” settings, households, and at eateries. Given this, the Multi-Ministry Taskforce announced additional measures and restrictions under Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) to minimise transmission of the virus in a swift and decisive manner. These measures are additional measures to what was announced on 4 May 2021.To reduce risks of community transmission, indoor “mask-off” activities such as dine-in F&B establishments will cease. Other activities which will also not be allowed during this period include strenuous indoor exercise class or strenuous individual and group indoor sports and exercise activities.

Additionally, the Government will provide one month of rental waiver for hawker stall and coffeeshop tenants of Government agencies. Commercial landlords are urged to support their F&B tenants through this period. Expansion of Testing Strategy for Quicker ResponseFor swifter detection of possible cases, the Antigen Rapid Testing (ART) will be administed to all who present themselves with Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI) symptoms at the Swab and Send Home (SASH) Public Health Preparedness Clinics (PHPCs), Polyclinics, Emergency Departments and Regional Swab Centres (RSCs). This ART will be done together with the COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test that all such patients will already have been subjected to. Both the ART and the PCR tests will be funded by the Government for all individuals with ARI symptoms. While the ART is less accurate than the PCR test, it has a quicker turnaround time which will allow for the authorities to take swifter public health actions for those who test positive for the ART test. Vaccination Remains CriticalVaccination remains critical in the fight against COVID-19. As of 13 May, about 1.9 million individuals have received at least one dose of the vaccine, of whom about 1.3 million individuals have received their second dose and completed the full vaccination regimen. The recent cases illustrate that vaccination may not eliminate the risks of the infection completely, but it does provide significant protections against infections and helps to reduce the severity of the disease and onward transmission. It is therefore important to be vaccinated when offered.For more information, clickherefor MOH’s press release.', 'id': '2429fba1-899d-46b2-b963-18936dd293ab', 'score': None, 'probability': None, 'question': None, 'meta': {'category': 'articles'}, 'embedding': None},\n",
       " {'text': 'how singapore is ensuring access to covid 19 vaccines Singapore became the first nation in Asia to receive doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on 21 December 2020, thanks to a coordinated approach between the Government, the scientific community and industry partners. Soon after the COVID-19 outbreak began, the wheels in Singapore’s efforts to secure vaccines began turning as the Government began closely monitoring the global development of vaccines. An early startIn April 2020, a Therapeutics and Vaccines expert panel (TxVax panel) was formed to source for vaccine candidates around the world. The panel, comprising 18 scientists and clinicians across hospitals, A*STAR and the private sector, conducted an extensive study of 35 promising candidates to screen them for safety and efficacy. The TxVax panel relies on data that comes from the different vaccine companies at their respective stages of clinical trials. The clinical trial process, which involves testing an experimental drug or vaccine, has three phases. The first two phases are typically carried out among smaller groups to test the vaccine’s safety and efficacy. Researchers assess how the human immune system is responding to the vaccine and monitor for possible side effects. Trials in the third phase are significantly larger, often involving thousands of people across multiple countries. This phase determines if the vaccine can protect users from the infection. As more data was released across the different stages of the trials, the TxVax panel updated and refined their assessments, and passed their recommendations to a group of planners.Diversifying vaccine options Given the lack of certainty over which vaccine would succeed, the planning group diversified the choices across different vaccine technology platforms. The Economic Development Board (EDB) also weighed in on the criteria for choosing the vaccines. “The 35 (vaccine candidates) that we looked at very seriously, we had already pre-screened, based on certain characteristics like the technology type, who is developing it, the track record and the timeline of development,” said Ms. Lisa Ooi, EDB’s Vice President of Healthcare and Wellness Strategy. Given the variety of vaccines types, there needed to be a “balance between established options and fastest to the market”, Ms. Ooi added. Assessment and monitoring of the vaccinesOver the months, the planning group made careful assessments of the different vaccines before deciding which to purchase. Vaccines from Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech and Sinovac have been purchased, and there are ongoing efforts to procure others to ensure a diversified range of options. As the Ministry of Health negotiated the commercial agreements, the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) reviewed the clinical trial data to guide Singapore’s vaccine review process. COVID-19 vaccines approved for use, such as the Pfizer-BioNTech one, have gone through a thorough review for safety. Professor Benjamin Seet, Deputy Group CEO (Education & Research) at the National Healthcare Group explained more about the process.“While mRNA vaccines (such as the Pfizer-BioNTech one) are new and there are some uncertainties, when you look at the clinical trials as well as the scientific review, it is very rigorous.” As the drug is used in Singapore, companies will continue to work with HSA to monitor any side effects. Ensuring early access The planning group collaborated with the vaccine producers to ensure that delivery schedules were met, even roping in our national carrier, Singapore Airlines, so that there were flights from airports near where the vaccines were produced. When the vaccines arrive in Singapore, they will be kept in cold chain facilities, where they can be stored for months. Following that, the vaccines will be transported to the sites where they will be administered. There are also ongoing efforts to establish vaccine production facilities in Singapore. Thermo Fisher Scientific, one of the world’s largest life sciences company, recently announced that it would establish a new US$130m facility in Singapore in 2022. Several other companies are also in the final stages of talks to invest in new vaccine production plants here. Made possible by a strong partnership Singapore is one of the first countries to obtain the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. The 11 months it took from when the virus first arrived in Singapore to when we received our first shipment of vaccines on 21 December 2020 was no fluke. It was due to the team of public officers, scientists and industry partners who worked tirelessly behind the scenes to make early access to vaccines possible. The road to vaccine procurement was fraught with uncertainty but with the shipment now on our shores, Singapore is now ready to roll-out its vaccination plan for our residents.*Photo (used in banner image) by the Ministry of Communications and Information', 'id': '66ffcf5a-fd4e-409d-86ca-3321b633e43b', 'score': None, 'probability': None, 'question': None, 'meta': {'category': 'articles'}, 'embedding': None},\n",

       " {'text': 'experts explain covid 19 vaccines Singapore’s COVID-19 vaccination programme is underway and you are encouraged to get vaccinated when it is offered to you.But some may be concerned about side effects, allergic reactions and even the safety of the vaccine.Prof Tan Chorh Chuan, Singapore’s Chief Health Scientist and member of the Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination, has the facts.Why should I be vaccinated?Prof Tan: Vaccination will protect each of us, at the same time, it will help protect our loved ones. The more people get vaccinated, the lower the risk of big outbreaks from occurring and this in turn will protect those who are not recommended now for vaccination. These include people who are less than 16 years old, those who are pregnant and those with severe immuno-compromised conditions.Vaccination also allows us to resume social activities much more quickly and to further reopen our economy.What are the vaccine’s side effects?Prof Tan: When I had my vaccination, the actual injection was painless because the needle was very fine. Then, on the same day I had some soreness in the arm which had the vaccine, and then the next day I had some headache. But now, I feel perfectly well.For most of us who are going for vaccination, we should expect some mild side effects, usually pain and soreness in the arm, a bit of tiredness, headache. Some people get fever. But usually they just last for one, two or three days.One of the things we look out for is severe allergic reactions. This is rare. In the vaccine rollout that has occurred around the UK and US, about eleven per one million people might get severe allergic side effects. But besides that, the rates of serious side effects is very, very low. Individuals who are vaccinated are monitored for half an hour at the vaccination site. The vaccination site has all the facilities and medications ready to deal with a severe allergic reaction and the staff are trained to react very quickly so as to minimise the risk. Will the vaccine protect against new virus strains?Prof Tan: So, both Pfizer and Moderna have come forward to say that their vaccines continue to be effective against the variants that have been seen in the UK. We are continuing to monitor this very carefully, as additional studies are being done and as more data comes out in the coming weeks. Is the vaccine safe?Prof Tan: The vaccines that have been approved are safe. There are three important points to bear in mind.(i) The first is the rapid speed in which the vaccines were developed for COVID-19 occurred because of very major advances in the science, in the manufacturing, as well as the huge amounts of funding that were put in to support vaccine development by governments, by industry and by not-for-profit organisations. So the process is much faster, but the standards that are being applied to the process, to the evaluation is kept very high, if not higher.(ii) The second point to note is that, there are regulatory agencies such as the Health Sciences Authority in Singapore that look very carefully at the data for each vaccine. They apply high international standards to review the safety, the quality and the effectiveness of every vaccine.(iii) We also have an expert committee on COVID-19 vaccination that also looks at the safety and effectiveness data of the different vaccines for rollout in Singapore.Can I choose my vaccine?Prof Tan: Any vaccines approved for use in Singapore would have met high safety standards, quality standards, and effectiveness standards. So when you are invited to come forward for vaccination, you shouldn’t have to worry about choosing which particular vaccine you will be receiving.But we should also know that the different vaccines have different logistical requirements, so it would make it very complicated if individuals were to choose which vaccines they want. The whole vaccination process is already very complicated, and adding that additional element would make it even more difficult to roll out efficiently and quickly. With safe management measures in place, is vaccination necessary?Prof Tan: It is very important that even after vaccination, that we continue to wear a mask, and continue to adhere to safe distancing measures. This is because the vaccination roll out will take some time, and during that period, there will be many in Singapore who are still not protected, and they will be susceptible to infection should an outbreak occur.When can I get my vaccination?Prof Tan: Vaccination will be rolled out progressively, but initially because supplies will be limited, there will have to be prioritisation, and the priority groups will be healthcare workers, people who are frontline responders, as well as those people in essential services, and then seniors.When your turn comes, MOH will notify you to come forward for vaccination. If you have any queries, you can visit vaccine.gov.sg or call 1800-333-9999.', 'id': 'e9c4ea6f-c9b3-4d33-acc2-1650b9367380', 'score': None, 'probability': None, 'question': None, 'meta': {'category': 'articles'}, 'embedding': None},\n",

The Multi-Ministry Taskforce has been monitoring the situation closely and has convened special COVID-19 testing operations for all workers at the dormitory. Restricting travel from IndiaWhile no evidence suggests that the recent cases at Westlite Woodlands Dormitory are linked to the new COVID-19 strain in India, border measures with India will be tightened in light of the worsening COVID-19 situation in India.The following measures will be implemented with immediate effect: All travellers with recent travel history to India who have yet to complete their 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) by 22 April 2021, 11.59pm, will need to complete an additional 7-day SHN at dedicated SHN facilities, instead of their place of residence. These individuals will also have to undergo Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) tests on-arrival, on Day 14 of their SHN, and another test before the end of their 21-day SHN period. From 23 April 2021, 11.59pm, until further notice, all long-term pass holders and short-term visitors with recent travel history (including transit) to India within the last 14 days will not be allowed entry or transit through Singapore. This also applies to all who had obtained prior approval for entry into Singapore. Additional precautions for recovered personsIn consultation with infectious disease specialists, the Ministry of Health (MOH) and Ministry of Manpower have reviewed scientific evidence from a cohort of recovered persons in Singapore, and found evidence that suggests a possible decrease in antibody levels of individuals that have recovered from COVID-19. As such, caution is required around the infection risks of recovered persons.With effect from 29 April 2021: Recovered dormitory dwelling workers and Construction, Marine and Process workers living in Singapore who have crossed 270 days from the date of COVID-19 infection, will no longer be exempted from prevailing public health measures. These individuals will be enrolled back on Rostered Routine Testing (RRT) once they have passed 270 days from the date of past infection. If they are identified as close contacts of COVID-19 positive cases, they will be subjected to quarantine immediately. Newly arrived migrant workers with a serology positive result will also be enrolled onto 14-day RRT.Singapore will closely monitor cases of reinfection and review border measures for recovered travellers. Imported cases suspected of re-infection will be isolated and will have to undergo repeated COVID-19 PCR tests, for monitoring, and to ensure that such cases are detected promptly.

It is critical that employers implement SMMs seriouslyand ensure that safe distancing is adhered to. Additionally, employers need toimplement flexible workplace hours to allow a good part of workers to traveloff-peak (after 0930 hours), which helps to mitigate the risk of crowding inpublic places and office buildings during peak hours.Steppingup enforcement at F&B outletsDining outis an activity that involves considerable risks, as people are crowded togetherin an enclused space, without their masks on, for a prolonged duration.SMMbreaches continue to happen at some F&B outlets, especially those atpopular nightspots. These breaches include the sale and consumption of alcoholafter 2230 hours, individuals not wearing masks as required, gathering ingroups of more than 5 and intermingling between groups (eg. inside privateroom), seating customers less than 1m apart and the playing of loud music.Since the start of Phase 2, about 20 F&B establishments have beensuspended.

Singapore has alsoobserved a significant number of imported cases with recent travel history toIndia. To reducethe risk of case importation from India, travelers who are not Singaporecitizens or PRs and have recent travel history to India within the last 14 daysprior to entry will be required to take a COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction(PCR) test within 72 hours before departure. They need to present a validnegative test result as a condition to enter Singapore. This requirement willtake effect for those arriving in Singapore from 17 September 2020, 0000 hours, and will apply on top of theexisting requirements of a 14-day Stay Home Notice (SHN) at dedicated SHNfacilities and a negative test before end of SHN.Read more:', 'id': '2746c8b6-ec72-49bc-bb04-9b3eb742a72f', 'score': None, 'probability': None, 'question': None, 'meta': {'category': 'articles'}, 'embedding': None},\n",
       " {'text': 'how the mice sector is adapting quickly to covid 19 The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic had immediate repercussions for Singapore’s MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conferences and Exhibitions) sector.Speaking about the impact that the pandemic first had on the MICE industry, Veemal Gungadin, CEO of GlobalSign.in, a technology provider for events quipped: “In a matter of just a few weeks, we had all our physical events either cancelled or postponed until further notice.”For a sector that caters to a decidedly international audience – many events aim at bringing in an audience from top global markets – the pandemic has forced companies to quickly adapt and even re-think their business model.“While the logical immediate step was to start pivoting projects to the virtual space, we soon realised that it was not so easy,” noted Don Tsai, project director at First Wave Agency. With First Wave Agency specialising in events production, Tsai found that the entire customer experience was evolving to something very different, and the team was initially not familiar with virtual tools. Going digital Realising that it had to adapt quickly, First Wave encouraged team members to familiarise themselves with new virtual tools by participating in virtual product demonstrations. Employees also picked up new digital skills by taking short courses on topics like live streaming and cybersecurity, while a newly formed innovation team started working on potential fresh ideas for a situation where everyone had to live with the virus amidst the “new normal.” GlobalSign.in chose to focus on educating their customers and the industry on the paradigm shift by creating a Digital Events Academy. They leveraged their technology expertise to provide event organisers with a solution to move their events online. The result – GEVME Live, an all-in-one platform for running online events – has generated interest in countries like the United States.Reflecting on the increasing digitalisation of the sector, Aloysius Arlando – president of the Singapore Association of Convention & Exhibition Organisers & Suppliers (SACEOS) – shares a few observations he has made thus far.“The age of your company and team members does not matter; what is important is how you capitalise on digital platforms. Crucially, knowing your customers’ needs and how you can address them will allow companies to stay profitable,” he quips. Hybrid events from October From 1 October, organisers can begin applying to pilot MICE events in Singapore, subject to attendance caps and the necessary approvals from the authorities.The Singapore International Energy Week (SIEW) 2020, scheduled to run from 26 to 30 October, will be one of the pilot events taking place as the MICE industry gradually resumes. SIEW is slated to take place in a hybrid format that mixes physical events (for up to 250 people) with online participation. Robust Safe Management Measures (SMM) devised by the Singapore Tourism Board (STB), which event organisers are expected to strictly implement and enforce, will be in place for the upcoming pilot events.The specially developed SMMs under the Safe Business Events framework are meant to achieve outcomes aimed at keeping attendees and organisers safe. They include: Pre and post infection control measures, e.g. all attendees to use TraceTogether Controlled density of attendees Limited opportunities for close contact between individuals For infectious disease consultant Professor Dale Fisher, the pilot events will test how social opportunities – a key attraction of business conferences and meetings – can be integrated while adhering to the SMMs. Looking ahead, ensuring our healthcare protocols are maintained at the highest standard possible will be a comparative advantage for Singapore’s MICE sector, noted Arlando.Message to those interested in joining the sector According to a MICE Economic Impact Assessment commissioned by STB in 2019, the industry supported more than 34,000 jobs.The transition to new and hybrid event formats has created a need for more talent with new skills, passionate and well-trained individuals whom Gungadin calls “digital events managers.” These managers combine technical expertise with their event management experience to create engaging experiences for event attendees (both physical and digital).Both Gungadin and Arlando urge those interested in the sector to assess what skills they currently lack and explore opportunities like training programmes to fill those gaps.You need to “know your platforms, animations and chatbots”, mused Arlando, and be agile to shifting trends. “As long as you keep your mind open, you will have a good shot at not just getting a job but also creating genuine value.” New opportunities in the MICE sector Fuelled by growth areas such as hybrid events and domestic tours, over 2,400 MICE jobs, traineeships and attachments have been created. PMET roles include conference planners and systems analysts, while non-PMET jobs such as opportunities for IT consultants are available.

       " {'text': 'pm lee responding to covid 19 and the other challenges ahead In his speech at the debate on the Motion of Thanks to the President, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong spoke about how Singapore has dealt with the COVID-19 outbreak, how social safety nets can be improved amidst the challenges of COVID-19 and beyond, and how we can achieve a better balance in politics and build political consensus.He noted that Singapore had experienced several major crises since independence, and with each incident, Singapore came back stronger. Here’s a summary of his speech:1.Singapore’s response to COVID-19 We flattened the curve through:a.Contact tracing and testing capabilities b.Expansion of healthcare systemc.Mobilising SAF and Home Team to assist in testing and ensuring well-being of migrant workersd.Implementing circuit breaker in April 2020Singapore has done well in terms of health outcomes – low fatality rate, declining new infection rate, fewer than 100 patients in hospital.Singapore’s COVID-19 response was not without shortcomings, as the virus has severely tested every government in the world. Some things the government might have done differently:a.Discovering people with COVID-19 were infectious when asymptomaticb.Quarantine of all returning overseas Singaporeans, instead of only those returning from certain countries c.Testing all of them before releasing from quarantine, even when they don’t show symptoms d.Requiring the wearing of face masks soonerOverall, Singapore has been able to deal with COVID-19 only because the public service, the political leadership, our businesses, and the Singapore public have worked closely together, each doing their part. We must never let our guard down even as the current situation stabilises2.Social Safety Nets-To protect the vulnerable in our society and ensure that everyone has full access to opportunities to improve their lives-Extensive social safety nets were not needed in early decades of nationhood as Singapore was rapidly growing and the social infrastructure then was adequate for the pace of living-As our economy matures, we have progressively strengthened our social safety nets through introducing many schemes in these 15 years eg. ComCare, Workfare, Silver Support-These peacetime measures were insufficient during the COVID-19 outbreak – new emergency measures eg. Jobs Support Scheme, COVID-19 Support Grant were implemented -Identify pragmatic solutions to make best use of Singapore’s resources to meet the needs of different groups eg. older workers, low-wage workers, in a targeted manner -Ensure that government programmes should be kept fiscally sustainable 3.Foreign workers-Issue of competition between Singaporeans and foreigners for jobs has become sharper in this period of economic downturn-Many Singaporeans are feeling anxious and pressured about their jobs-With a small population, Singapore has to bring in foreign workers to grow the economy -Foreign worker policies are in place to grow the workforce in Singapore, rather than substituting the Singaporean worker-Employment Pass and S Pass numbers have come down since COVID-19 started -To ensure fair treatment in the workforce, there are different frameworks and organisations in place to do so eg. Tripartite Alliance for Fair & Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP), Fair Consideration Framework-Singapore still remains one of the few trusted countries that stand out – many companies have expressed interest in coming to Singapore to develop their business, which will create good new jobs for Singaporeans4.Politics-As our society evolves, there will be many difficult issues that we need to deal with -The government will lead this discussion with Singaporeans, build a political consensus around the right solutions, and move us forward-Attitudes and aspirations of Singaporeans change – desire more diversity, alternative voices, checks and balances-In the last General Election, many people voted for the opposition, while fully expecting that the PAP would remain in power as the government-Each new generation of PAP leaders has developed their own leadership styles and their own policy priorities-Tone of Parliament’s debate to shift with stronger opposition presence-At the most fundamental level, to make our politics work, both the government and opposition must share an overriding objective – to work for Singapore, not just for our party or our supporters', 'id': 'ff94000e-2407-4d54-a069-716f931ed391', 'score': None, 'probability': None, 'question': None, 'meta': {'category': 'articles'}, 'embedding': None},\n",

Hear from frontliners Kathryn, Mastura and Abdul Lathiff, who had their fair share of initial fears, but still decided to get vaccinated to protect themselves, their loved ones and the community. Read their stories below:“This pandemic has changed our lives drastically and almost everything we do here at PCF Sparkletots. While some semblance of normalcy has been restored with the resumption of physical classes, things are not as they were before.This was one of my motivations to get vaccinated.As the Executive Principal of the preschool centre, I’m in frequent contact with my staff, parents and students. I know that I’ve a social responsibility to protect those around me, especially the children who cannot be vaccinated. All of us have the responsibility to protect those who cannot take the vaccine due to age or certain medical conditions.Even though I was a little apprehensive about taking the COVID-19 vaccine due to my hypertension, my fears were alleviated after I consulted with my doctor. He assured me that the vaccines were safe, which gave me the extra resolve to put my foot forward.If someone tells me that they will ‘wait and see’ before taking the vaccine, I will ask them ‘Why wait and see, when you can take it now to protect yourself and your loved ones?’If you are medically fit, take the COVID-19 vaccine. If not for yourself, do it for your loved ones.”– Kathryn Goy, 54, Executive Principal of PAP Community Foundation (PCF) Sparkletots and Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) Fellow“I’ve always suffered from frequent and chronic coughs. When the first COVID-19 vaccine was approved in Singapore, I had just been discharged from the hospital after recuperating from a lung infection.Even then, I knew that I had to take the vaccine when it was offered to me. As I had existing health problems, my family was very worried about potential long-term side effects, and repeatedly asked me if I was sure about my decision.Although I had some worries at the start, I asked myself, ‘Why am I afraid? I am doing this for my health, and for my family’s health. If I get COVID-19, my family may get it as well. I want to do it for them.’As a healthcare worker, I also wanted to set a good example to show my patients that COVID-19 vaccines are safe. I knew that before I could take care of patients, I had to first take care of myself. When I informed the nurse at the vaccination centre of my medical conditions, she assured me that I was medically fit to take the vaccine.After the vaccination, I only had mild side effects from the second dose which were easily and quickly managed. Having been assured through my experience, my family members also decided to get vaccinated. My husband, who has hypertension, just completed both doses of the vaccine.Protect yourself, and your loved ones. I got my shot, get yours too!”– Mastura Binti Mohamad, 54, Senior Patient Service Associate in Sengkang General Hospital“I really miss interacting freely with passengers and my fellow colleagues. Life has not been the same since. There were many days where I have felt discouraged. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the transport industry tremendously. During Circuit Breaker, our ridership went down quite a bit. We also had to intensify various safety precautions for our passengers, such as disinfecting high-touch points and sanitising our buses twice a day.That’s why I was happy to hear about the COVID-19 vaccines. I believe that the vaccine will protect myself, my loved ones and my passengers.I was one of the first Bus Captains to sign up for the vaccination. I chose to go for the first available slot to instill confidence and encourage my fellow colleagues and union members to do the same. As a frontliner, it is also my duty to protect myself so I can protect the passengers I meet daily.All of us have a role to play in the fight against COVID-19. Even though there is a small chance that a vaccinated person can still get infected, the risk of them falling very sick is greatly reduced!We should all take the vaccination to protect ourselves and those around us!”– Abdul Lathiff Mohamed Rafi, 48, Senior Bus Captain at SBS Transit and Ulu Pandan Bus Depot Union Leader________________________________________________________________________________________#IGotMyShotSG is a campaign that encourages Singaporeans to get their COVID-19 vaccine when it’s available to them.

Close contacts of confirmed cases are actively tested to ring-fence possible onward transmissions.Targeted groups are regularly tested to help detect unlinked cases in the community. About seven in 10 of the unlinked cases were asymptomatic and almost half are likely to be past infections. Remaining cases in the community continue to be in the low single digits. Testing of those with ARI symptoms at first presentation have been scaled up and monitored closely; as it’s an indicator of underlying community transmissions.Update at dormitoriesAs of 16 July 2020, around 232,000 workers have either recovered, or been tested to be free from COVID-19.Testing of all workers should be completed by mid-August.Additional decontamination measures have been put in place to allow recovered workers to leave the dormitories and resume work safely, without compromising public health.Singapore cannot afford to be complacent, especially after we have resumed most activities after the Circuit Breaker period.

       " {'text': 'how to keep safe during weddings and solemnisations Weddings are certainly a cause for joy and celebration. But planning for one during Phase 3 of Singapore’s re-opening during this COVID-19 period can be more complicated. Besides keeping to venue capacity limits, it is important for wedding organisers, venue operators, the bride, groom and their guests, to keep to Safe Management Measures (SMMs). Here’s how you can keep safe during weddings. 1. Make sure you are wellFor the sake of the bride, groom, and all the other guests, make sure you are not ill before attending the solemnisation or wedding. If you are feeling sick, see a doctor and stay home. Ask the couple if there are options to attend the wedding virtually. 2. Facilitate contact tracingAll wedding attendees must use TraceTogether and SafeEntry to help with contact tracing. Temperatures of all attendees should be taken before entry into the event.In addition, the couple should inform the licensed solemniser of the names of all attendees and vendors engaged. Attendance records need to be kept for 14 days after the solemnisation. 3. Adhere to capacity limitsIf the wedding is held in a home, keep to a maximum of 8 visitors. This excludes the solemniser, vendors and members of the host household. Do note that if the event is being held in a home, you can only hold solemnisations and not a reception (with food and beverage). You could consider having a separate reception at venues where proper SMMs can be observed. For weddings held at an external venue, including places of worship, you can have a maximum of 100 guests. The guests will need to be split into:- 2 zones of up to 50 pax each, OR- Staggered timeslots of up to 50 pax per time slot, with 30 minutes between each session.4. Distance between groups must be at least 1m apartBesides a designated core of 20 persons (including the bride, groom and witnesses), the rest of the guests will need to keep to groups of up to 8 pax. The groups need to keep at least 1m apart at all times. 5. Follow fixed seating and keep to your zonesGuests will need to be assigned seats and food should be served to them. Buffets are not allowed. This also means that other freestanding activities such as photobooths are not allowed.6. Mask upThe bride and groom must use a mask or face shield throughout the solemnisation. However, they can remove it for key moments, including the exchanging of vows and rings, to kiss and during the wedding march-ins and outs. During these moments, the couple needs to maintain a 2m distance from the rest of the guests.All other attendees must keep their mask on throughout, except for when they are eating or drinking. They may remove their masks momentarily for photos. All wedding organisers, venue operators & couples must adhere to SMMs.Enforcement action will be taken against errant operators and individuals. This includes fines, suspension of operations and prosecution. Wedding venue “The Orange Ballroom” at Tanjong Katong Complex was ordered to close for 20 days for allowing a couple to host three wedding receptions involving 275 persons on 30 Jan 2021.

The video, published on the Singapore Incidents’ Facebook and Instagram posts on 5 May 2021, contained a watermark indicating the date of the video as 5 May 2021 and the location as Changi Airport. There are also other similar videos spreading on social media.This video, viewed in the light of the Government's public statements on the restrictions on entry by non-Singapore Citizens or Permanent Residents with recent travel history to India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, implied that the Government’s current restrictions on entry were not in effect, or that the travel ban was not being properly enforced, or enforced at all, by the Government.The information in the video is false. The video was not filmed on 5 May 2021.Clarifications The video showed travellers from South Asia arriving at Changi Airport Terminal 1, and a clock indicating the time as 14:53 hrs. According to flight records, there were no flights from South Asia (India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka) that arrived at any terminal in Changi Airport between 08:00 hrs and 15:30 hrs on 5 May 2021. In the video, passengers were seen walking past a renovation hoarding at gate hold room D42/43 in Terminal 1. This hoarding had been removed on 5 April 2021, establishing that the video was taken before 5 April 2021. As the Government announced previously, all long-term pass holders and short-term visitors with recent travel history to India are not allowed entry into or transit through Singapore with effect from 23 April 2021, 23:59 hrs. This border control measure was extended to all long-term pass holders and short-term visitors with recent travel history to Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka with effect from 1 May 2021, 23:59 hrs. While there are still passenger flights arriving in Singapore from South Asia, these flights carry primarily returning Singapore citizens and Permanent Residents, cargo, or fly in empty to pick up passengers in Singapore who are returning to South Asia. For example, on 5 May 2021, there were 5 passenger flights arriving in Singapore from South Asia, carrying a total of 50 passengers, all of whom were returning Singapore citizens or Permanent Residents.

       " {'text': 'pm lees address on the covid 19 situation in singapore 21 april 2020 Fellow Singaporeans & ResidentsI am speaking to you again to give you an update on the COVID-19 situation We are now two weeks into the circuit breaker. On the whole, people have coped well. Most of us have played our part, staying at home, complying with the restrictions.We have adjusted to working from home and home-based learning. When outside, we wear masks and keep a safe distance from others. And we have kept to our immediate family units and avoided gatherings with extended family and friends.The number of new cases in the local community has levelled off, to below 30 new cases daily. This is the result of the circuit breaker, and all of us working together. But as you know, our total case numbers have risen sharply since the last time I spoke to you, just ten days ago. Today alone, we have over 1,100 new cases. Almost all were detected in our migrant worker dormitories, through aggressive testing.Migrant workersThe large number of cases at the dorms is a serious problem. To assess the extent of the spread, we have tested aggressively. Not only those who reported sick, or showed fever or flu symptoms. But also those who were well and asymptomatic.Almost all the migrant workers infected have only mild symptoms. This is not surprising as they are generally young, and thus much less likely to become seriously ill with COVID-19.Our doctors, nurses and healthcare personnel are also working hard, triaging them early, and taking good care of them. It is early days yet, but thankfully, so far none of the new cases of migrant workers have needed supplemental oxygen, or intensive care.We had one earlier case of a Bangladeshi worker, who was in the ICU for two months. This was Case 42. We never gave up on him. Last week, his condition stabilised. He was transferred out of the ICU, to a general ward. It will still take some time for him to fully recover. With some luck, he should be able to see his new-born son soon.We hope that the situation in the dorms will remain this way: most of the cases being mild, and very few needing oxygen or intensive care. All the major dorms are supported by dedicated teams of doctors and nurses.To protect the health of our migrant workers, we will step up the medical resources in the dorms. We will deploy more medical personnel, to make sure that anyone with fever or flu symptoms receives appropriate and timely medical treatment. We will house the mild cases either on site, in a separate facility within the dorm, or in community care facilities elsewhere. And we will make sure that those who need more active treatment receive immediate attention, and can be sent promptly to the hospital to help them recover.We will also pay special attention to the older workers, who are more vulnerable. We are pre-emptively moving them to a separate dorm, where they can be monitored more closely. We will look after your health, your welfare and your livelihood. We will work with your employers to make sure that you get paid, and you can send money home. And we will help you stay in touch with friends and family.Ramadan begins in a few days’ time. We will make sure that arrangements are made for our Muslim workers. When Aidilfitri comes next month, we will celebrate with our Muslim friends, just as we celebrated the Indian New Year with our Indian friends last week. This is our duty and responsibility to you, and your families.Apart from the workers living in dorms, we are monitoring two other groups of migrant workers closely. First, workers who live in shophouses, private housing, or HDB flats. Second, workers in essential services. This group is still working during the circuit breaker, helping to keep Singapore going. Some are cleaning the HDB blocks or hawker centres. Others are maintaining key infrastructure like our broadband networks.If these workers move in and out of dorms, they become potential channels for cross infection in both directions. Hence we are housing these essential workers separately. We are also testing them to make sure that they are healthy, and to pick up any infections early.So far, the clusters in the dorms have remained largely contained, and have not spread to the wider community. We will do our utmost to keep it this way.CommunityIn the wider community, the circuit breaker is starting to have an effect. The number of community cases has fallen in recent days. To bring down daily infections more sharply, to a single digit, or even zero. And to reduce the number of unlinked cases: those cases where we do not know how they got infected, or from whom.Because unfortunately that number of unlinked cases has not come down. And this suggests there is a larger, hidden reservoir of COVID-19 cases in the community, that is the source of these unlinked cases, which we have not detected.I discussed with the Multi-Ministry Task Force (MTF) on the next steps to take. We want to bring down the community numbers decisively. We also want to make sure that if any leakage occurs from the dorms to the wider community, we can detect and contain it early, and prevent new clusters from forming and bursting out of control. If you do need to go out, then go by yourself, not as a group or as a family. Even when exercising outside, do so only by yourself, and only in your own neighbourhood. Remember: it is not just about adhering to the letter of the law.The spirit of the guidelines is to reduce movement to a minimum, and to avoid being out and about in the community. This is the way to protect yourself, your family and everyone else. So I hope everyone can cooperate and do your part. Some hotspots, like some popular wet markets, are still a problem. Large groups of people continue to gather at these places, making it hard to practise safe distancing. These places will impose entry restrictions to thin out the crowds even more.You can do your part too. Do your marketing on weekdays rather than weekends, and don’t bring your whole family with you for grocery shopping. When you run errands, go out alone, get what you need, and return home straightaway.We will also close more workplaces, so that only the most essential services will remain open. This will reduce further the number of workers keeping essential services going, and minimise the risks of transmission among the workers. It will mean some degradation of services – for example, less frequent grass cutting in our HDB estates. But I hope we all understand why this has to be done. Then, provided we have brought the community numbers down, we can make further adjustments and consider easing some measures. This way, we can be more assured that we have made definite progress and consolidated our position.Many will be disappointed by the extension of the circuit breaker. Especially our businesses and workers, who are hurting greatly. But I hope you understand that this short-term pain is to stamp out the virus, protect the health and safety of our loved ones, and allow us to revive our economy.The Government will continue to help our businesses and workers cope during the extended circuit breaker period. We will provide the same level of support to our workers and businesses as we are doing now. The ministers will hold a press conference immediately after this to explain the details.ConclusionLet me conclude in English.You will naturally ask – where does this lead us? How do we exit from the circuit breaker?Nobody knows how long the pandemic will last. Most likely it will take more than a year, before effective treatments and vaccines become available. So we have to take things one step at a time.To exit from the circuit breaker, we need to do three things.First, we must open up incrementally, in small steps, making sure that we are safe each step of the way. This is what New Zealand and Germany are beginning to do, very cautiously. They believe that they have broken the chain of transmission, but they want to be extra careful. They do not want to open up prematurely after lock downs, only to find COVID-19 coming back, and then be forced to lock down a second time. It has happened in Hokkaido. We should try our best to avoid this.Second, we need to scale up testing for COVID-19 substantially, so that we can quickly detect any new cases that pop up. This we are progressively doing, not only by procuring test kits and equipment from other countries, but also by developing and manufacturing our own test kits.Third, we will need to make full use of IT, so that when we discover COVID-19 cases, we can trace more efficiently where they have been, and whom they have been in contact with.We have the TraceTogether app, and we are currently developing other apps for this purpose. For these apps to work, we will need everyone’s cooperation to install and use them, like what the South Koreans have done. There will be some privacy concerns, but we will have to weigh these against the benefits of being able to exit from the circuit breaker and stay open safely.I know this has not been an easy time for everyone. We are making progress, but we have not yet succeeded by a long way. The results show that the circuit breaker is working. We will overcome this together. Thank you.', 'id': '50ecdd5b-ecf3-47c4-8ea5-e21b45fde329', 'score': None, 'probability': None, 'question': None, 'meta': {'category': 'articles'}, 'embedding': None},\n",

Up to 5 patrons (friends and family) are allowed be seated together without the 1m distancing requirement. However, different groups of patrons must comply with the 1m requirement. The maximum capacity permitted per cinema hall is 50 patrons.All patrons must wear a mask at all times, even inside the cinema hall, except when consuming food and drink.Tourism businesses will be permitted to resume operations in stages from 1 July 2020, beginning with 13 attractions. The Singapore Tourism Board (STB) will also allow domestic tour operators to begin submitting their applications to resume operations.Hotels may also apply to reopen for staycation bookings, as well as the recreation areas for children (e.g. Kids' Club).Public libraries and the National Archives of Singapore Building have reopened on 1 July 2020, with shorter opening hours from 11am to 7pm. The Former Ford Factory is open from 11am to 4pm. The shorter opening hours is in line with safe re-opening measures under Phase 2, and to safeguard the health and safety of patrons and staff.Museums- Asian Civilisations Museum & National Musuem of Singapore have reopened on 26 June 2020, while Indian Heritage Centre, Malay Heritage Centre, Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall will reopen on 3 July 2020. Safe management measures will be implemented to ensure the safety of employees and visitors.Places of worship may resume congregational and other worship services from 26 June 2020, starting at 50 persons at a time (excluding religious and supporting workers, which should be kept to a minimum), subject to safe management measures.The Multi-Ministry Taskforce announced on 15 June 2020 that Singapore will move into Phase Two after 18 June 2359 hours. This is because community infection rates have generally remained stable, cases in migrant worker dormitories have declined, and there are no new large clusters emerging. Approach for Phase TwoThe aim is to ensure that Singapore’s efforts are sustained by limiting close contact amongst individuals, whilst maintaining hygiene and safe management principles.These safe distancing principles will apply for all activities that are allowed to resume in Phase Two: Ensure safe distancing of at least one metre at all times If safe distancing is not feasible, the one metre requirement can be enforced between groups, if group sizes do not exceed five people. There should be no mixing between groups. This applies to small-group social gatherings and households, who may receive up to five visitors at any one time.Activities that can resumeThese are the activities that can resume once Phase Two begins from 18 June 2020 2359 hours: Retail businesses, who may re-open their physical outlets Dine-in at food and beverage outlets (although live music, television and video screenings are not allowed at this stage) Personal health and wellness activities Home-based services Tuition and other private enrichment classes (although singing or voice training classes will not resume) Sports, parks and other public facilities. These include playgrounds, beaches, swimming complexes, sport halls, gyms and fitness studios, function rooms, and similar facilities in private condominiums and clubs Registered clubs and societies, at their registered premises All healthcare services, including face-to-face visits at residential facilities for the elderly, although safe distancing and precautionary measures will be put in placeLarger public venues, with high human traffic, such as malls and large standalone retail outlets must restrict capacity and prevent crowds or long queues from building up. Activities that can resume with specific rulesSpecific rules will apply to the following events: Weddings: Solemnisations at home, and at ROM or ROMM, may take place with up to ten people, excluding the solemnizer. At other venues, they may take place with up to twenty people, excluding the solemnizer Wakes and funerals: Twenty people may be present at any one time Schools and Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs): Students will return to school daily from 29 June 2020. IHLs will gradually increase the number of students back on campus for face-to-face learningActivities that cannot resume for nowSome activities, where many people come into close contact for long periods of time, will take more time to resume. This is to ensure large clusters do not form. These include: Large-scale events and venues, such as conferences, exhibitions, concerts and trade fairs Entertainment venues such as bars, nightclubs, karaoke outlets, theatres, as well as indoor and outdoor attractionsBusinesses to ensure telecommuting and safe managementAll employers have to ensure telecommuting by default, where possible. Employers must also ensure safe management measures are put in place. These include no social gatherings between employees and ensuring safe distancing of at least one metre at all times.The one metre safe distancing requirement may only be waived for groups of not more than five people in permitted businesses, such as F&B dine-in settings or classes where individuals come together for activities. Businesses must still ensure safe management measures are in place.Businesses who are found to be flouting safe management principles may be required to close.Everyone should play their part to achieve a COVID-safe SingaporeThere will be more new community cases as activities resume. Everyone needs to exercise caution: Be socially responsible Practise good personal hygiene Ensure safe distancing and adhere to safe management principles Use SafeEntry to check in and out when required, download and install the TraceTogether app Keep number of contacts small and limited to your regular circle of close contacts, to protect yourself and your families Seniors, who are especially vulnerable, should continue to exercise extra caution and stay at home as much as possibleThe Multi-Ministry Taskforce will monitor the situation closely, with the aim of re-opening our economy and society progressively, until a new normal is reached in Phase Three.\", 'id': 'd26b601d-3735-43d5-9808-f46770e41012', 'score': None, 'probability': None, 'question': None, 'meta': {'category': 'articles'}, 'embedding': None},\n",

While 2020’s Budgets were targeted at broad-based emergency support, this year’s Budget will focus on accelerating structural adaptations, to equip our businesses and workers with deep and future-ready capabilities.Over the next three years, the Government will allocate $24 billion to enable our firms and workers to emerge stronger. This effort builds on the momentum of the transformation push started five years ago, when the Industry Transformation Maps were launched.JOBS SUPPORT SCHEMEThe Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) was launched in 2020 to protect jobs and help firms retain local workers. The Government has committed over $25 billion to the JSS, and supported over 150,000 employers for up to 17 months. The current tranche will continue to cover wages up to March 2021 for most sectors.Here’s how the JSS will be extended: Firms in Tier 1 sectors (Aviation, Aerospace, Tourism): 30% support for wages paid from April to June 2021 10% support for wages paid from July to September 2021 Firms in Tier 2 sectors (e.g. Retail, Arts and Culture, Food Services, Built Environment): 10% support for wages paid from April to June 2021 Other sectors: Continued support up to March 2021, as previously announced SGUNITED JOBS AND SKILLS PACKAGEThe SGUnited Jobs and Skills Package was launched in 2020, to tackle the anticipated labour market fallout from COVID-19. As of end-2020, nearly 76,000 individuals have been placed into jobs, traineeships, attachments, and skills training. Under the Jobs Growth Incentive (JGI), an estimated 110,000 local jobseekers were collectively hired within two months from the implementation of the scheme.Here’s how the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Package will be extended: Additional $5.4 billion for a second tranche of SGUnited Jobs and Skills Package On top of $3 billion already allocated in 2020 $5.2 billion to extend JGI hiring window to September 2021 Support for SGUnited Skills, SGUnited Traineeships, SGUnited Mid-Career Pathways Programmes will be extended The next phase of the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Package will support the hiring of 200,000 locals this year, and provide up to 35,000 traineeship and training opportunities.ENHANCING SALARIES OF HEALTHCARE WORKERS Beyond the pandemic, the healthcare sector is set to grow, as our people age. This sector provides many good skilled jobs that are noble, meaningful, and make a difference to Singaporeans. The Government will enhance the salaries of our nurses and other healthcare workers, such as support care staff. This will apply to workers across public healthcare institutions, and publicly-funded community hospitals and long-term care service providers.STRENGTHENING OUR LOCAL WORKFORCEWhile some Singaporeans are concerned about our reliance on foreign manpower, many businesses and trade associations have found it difficult to hire locals.The Government will continue to support the employment of Singaporeans, while we deepen our capabilities and promote capability transfer and moderate our reliance on foreign labour:Here’s how: Extend Wage Credit Scheme to support wage increments for companies to retain and attract locals Extended for a year, at a co-funding level of 15% Extend Capability Transfer Programme to support foreign-to-local skills transfer Extended up to end-September 2024 As of end-2020, more than 140 companies and over 970 locals have benefitted, or expected to benefit from 40 projects Reduce Manufacturing S Pass Sub-Dependency Ratio Ceiling (Sub-DRC) to develop deep skills in local workforce, and reduce reliance on foreign labour Reduced to 18% from 1 January 2022 Reduced to 15% from 1 January 2023 For more on Budget 2021, visit www.singaporebudget.gov.sg', 'id': 'ef891f33-7674-4c7f-876a-db1c552bcdd8', 'score': None, 'probability': None, 'question': None, 'meta': {'category': 'articles'}, 'embedding': None},\n",
       " {'text': 'an update on community cases controls of covid 19 infection in phase 2 With the resumption of economic and social activities, community cases of COVID-19 in Singapore have increased.The Ministry of Health (MOH) has stepped up proactive measures to detect and isolate linked cases quickly, as well as uncover unlinked cases through active surveillance and aggressive testing.Here is an overview of the situation.Decline in total daily casesSince the Circuit Breaker period in April and May 2020, the number of total daily new cases has been declining.Migrant worker dormitory cases continue to decrease. Efforts to systematically test and clear migrant workers and dormitories will continue.Some imported cases20 imported cases were detected over the past week, mostly comprising returning Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents. A few are Work Pass or Dependant’s Pass Holders who have been approved to return to Singapore.To prevent community transmission from imported cases, travellers are isolated under Stay-Home Notices upon arrival to Singapore. They are also tested if they become unwell or before they end their Stay-Home Notice.Increase in community cases, over half are linkedOver the past week, an average of 12 community cases are detected a day, an increase from around 8 community cases a day in the prior week.Linked community casesOver half of these community cases (57%) since the start of Phase One are linked. These are detected through active case finding efforts, aggressive ring-fencing efforts around confirmed cases, and intensive contact tracing efforts to quarantine close contacts quickly.The most common mode of transmission amongst linked cases are households. Some transmissions occur in workplaces, especially those at frontline COVID-19 operations.Due to the tight restrictions imposed, fewer transmissions take place through social gatherings. However, continued vigilance is necessary as more social activities resume in Phase Two.Unlinked community casesRegular testing has also picked up unlinked community cases. About 6 in 10 were asymptomatic, or displaying no symptoms, and almost half are likely to be past infections who tested positive under serology tests.Half of unlinked cases have been from the construction sector and occupations, such as building trades workers and electrical instrument fitters. Two-thirds are likely to be past infections that are unlikely to be currently infectious, which could have been transmissions from earlier clusters. The construction sector therefore continues to be at a higher risk setting for transmission, as it is challenging to maintain strict safe management and distancing measures.The remaining unlinked cases in the community currently continue to remain in the low single digits. Increased testing has helped to identify these cases.Everyone should continue to stay vigilantWhile the number of unlinked community cases currently remain low, everyone should remain vigilant and adhere to safe management measures to reduce the spread of the virus.This is especially critical as cases will increase when more activities resume in Phase Two.Individuals should continue to use TraceTogether and SafeEntry to facilitate contact tracing, see a doctor if feeling unwell, and play their part to keep COVID-19 under control.Source: Ministry of Health', 'id': 'd24b14a3-02de-46df-8c41-2679020dde50', 'score': None, 'probability': None, 'question': None, 'meta': {'category': 'articles'}, 'embedding': None},\n",

Even as we unwind, remember to stay vigilant and maintain the good habits we have been practicing.1. Use SafeEntry and TraceTogether (TT) when you’re out and aboutContact tracing will continue to be essential in our fight against COVID-19. SafeEntry tracks entry and exit records at venues to identify any COVID-19 clusters. Remember to “Check-in” and “Check-out” when visiting places such as markets and malls. TT – both the app and token – helps to identify people in close contact with COVID-19 cases and ringfence infections quickly. TT does not collect data about your location, but uses proximity data instead. Read more about TraceTogether here.Download the TraceTogether app on your mobile device. For those who do not own or prefer not to use a mobile phone, you can collect the token at your constituency’s Community Centres/Clubs.2.

       " {'text': 'govsg howtos how to bring sport back safely As restrictions ease, sport and recreational facilities including swimming pools, stadiums and fitness studios have re-opened. But there are conditions that we should all abide by, to ensure that we continue to stay safe. When planning for sporting activities like basketball games, booking a gym session and even indoor group workouts, keep the following Safe Management Measures in mind:1. Use SafeEntry, TraceTogether and take your temperature as you enterBefore entering sport facilities, make sure you’re well. If you’re sick , be socially responsible and stay home. Check-in with SafeEntry and use TraceTogether as these are tools to facilitate contact tracing in the event it’s needed.2. Masks should be worn as a defaultYou may remove your mask when engaging in strenuous exercises, but mask-wearing is still recommended as a good practice.3. Practice safe distancing and keep group activities smallA physical distance of 2m should be maintained between individuals playing sports. If you’re engaging in indoor high intensity or high movement exercise classes, keep 3m apart from others. If you’re participating in group sports and activities, it has to be limited to a maximum of 5 participants. This may include an additional instructor or a coach for organised programmes and classesFor groups sharing a space, don’t mingle between groups. The groups must keep 3m apart at all times.4. Contact sports are permittedContact sports with prolonged contact (like wrestling and jujitsu) can proceed if a group size limit of 5 is maintained at all times. Multiple groups can share the same space, but groups should keep 3m apart with no intermingling.5. Maintain personal hygieneAbove all, to protect yourself and others, maintain good personal hygiene.Avoid touching public objects and common touchpoints as much as possible, and use a towel to wipe your sweat (don’t touch your face with your hands!). Wash or sanitise your hands after your sport or activity.If you can, bring your own personal equipment. If this cannot be done, then wipe the equipment before and after use.For detailed information on Safe Management Measures at specific facilities, click here.

Or your little nephew’s Man Yue?Either way, most celebrations usually call for gatherings with loved ones.But with increased activities and movement of people, there’s a higher risk of getting infected. We have to keep our guard up, and stay disciplined and vigilant.While planning for your next get-together, keep these tips in mind. Keep it small Continue to protect yourself and your families by keeping your gatherings to a small, regular circle of close contacts. Dine-out, space-out If you’re going to be dining out, keep in mind that there must not be more than eight diners at each table, with at least 1 metre spacing between tables or groups. Make sure you’re also keeping a 1-metre safe distance from other groups when queuing to enter or waiting to pay at the cashier counter. When you’re at the eatery, be sure that you keep your mask on at all times, except when eating or drinking. Celebrating at home You may receive up to eight unique visitors per household, per day.. If you are visiting another household, keep your mask on, except when eating or drinking. Try to limit your visiting to a maximum of two other households per day. Whether you’re dining out or celebrating at home, remember NOT to join the gathering if you are feeling unwell! (and please see a doctor asap!) Dial in Just because the number of visitors are limited, doesn’t mean that you can’t extend the invite to your entire kampung. Opt for digital means like video calls to include other loved ones in your celebration. Don’t share utensils or double dip What’s a good celebration without good food? Before you tuck in, make sure that there are separate serving utensils so the food doesn’t get contaminated. Avoid double dipping – it’s another way that the virus can spread.

       " {'text': 'avid volunteer delivered meals to 500 families While most Singaporeans were hunkering down at home during the Circuit Breaker period – wondering which drama series to watch next, or when they would be able to meet their friends for bubble tea again – 23 year-old Rini Shazwani Roslan was out in the sun, running from block to block, distributing food to the less privileged.For those affected financially by COVID-19, financial support like the Temporary Relief Fund and the COVID-19 Support Grant was welcome relief. But volunteers like Rini also help ease the financial burden of daily necessities and food.“Volunteering is natural to me. Whenever I see an opportunity for me to help, I will always ask if I can be part of the team. I want to help.”Because of her desire to help others, Rini joined voluntary welfare organisation Jamiyah Singapore, as a Human Resource Executive a year ago.This was not her first experience with Jamiyah FoodBank; she was part of the food distribution team in 2019. But 2020 would be so different – the Ramadan period was entirely within the Circuit Breaker. This meant that Muslim families would not be able to have iftar – the breaking of fast – and Hari Raya gatherings together with members outside their households.Photo credit: Jamiyah SingaporeIt was a harder blow for those living alone in rental flats. Many would have looked forward to the annual time of cheer, festivities and reunion, but were now faced with the prospect of celebrating Ramadan and Hari Raya Puasa by themselves. Some had also experienced a loss of job or income due to COVID-19.You are not aloneRini and her team from Jamiyah were determined that those badly affected should not feel alone during this time. They went door to door to over 500 households, distributing bento boxes so that they would have ready meals to break fast.Besides bento boxes, during weekend before Hari Raya Puasa, they distributed special Meat-for-Eid hampers – festive packages that contained ingredients for Raya dishes – so that their beneficiaries would be able to enjoy some semblance of normalcy and festive cheer during this difficult period.Whereas in previous years, beneficiaries could queue to collect the festive hampers at a centralised location, congregating in one location in the middle of a pandemic was not advisable.“It was very much different this year… Because we had to personally visit the homes of the beneficiaries, and that required us to cover quite a bit of distance.”Running from door to door, carrying hampers that weighed about 3kg each on both hands, was no mean feat for petite-sized Rini. While trolleys helped to alleviate the load, the journey across multiple floors and different blocks in Bukit Batok ensured that they were exhausted by the end of the day.Photo credit: Jamiyah SingaporeOnce, pressed for time as they had a long list of households to cover before iftar, they were on the receiving end of a beneficiary’s harsh reply, as their hurried knocking was misperceived as being disrespectful. Thankfully, the misunderstanding was quickly cleared up.Despite these challenges, Rini pressed on. Photo credit: Jamiyah SingaporeNot content with just a cursory ‘Hi’ and ‘Bye’, Rini often makes an effort to chat with them, asking how their day went, or how their health was. Older recipients often remark how grateful they are to have a listening ear.She remembers fondly an encounter with an elderly lady. Her son had gone to work and she was alone at home. To protect seniors, which are one of the vulnerable groups most susceptible to COVID-19 infection, Rini had to maintain a safe distance – meaning she could not enter her home. However, it was clear to her that the hamper would be too heavy for the elderly lady to carry into her flat by herself.Worried that her son would be back too late before she would have time to prepare for iftar, Rini helped to arrange for one of the elderly lady’s close neighbours to share some cooked dishes with her, so that she would be able to break fast in time.The gesture touched her deeply. Before Rini left, the lady earnestly made some doa (prayers) for her and her teammate, thanking them for caring for the less fortunate. Photo credit: Jamiyah SingaporeIt started at homeRini attributes her love for volunteering to her parents and grandparents.Growing up in a family of active volunteers, since the age of 9, Rini would follow her grandparents to the neighbourhood mosques and elderly homes to help out and spend time with the seniors there.Her parents, whom she regard as the most generous people she knows of, also had a big influence on her. Her mother often cooks – not just for friends and family – but also for charity events, while her father would always go the extra mile to help those in need.From following her elders as a child, volunteering eventually became her own way of life.While working life meant that she would not be able to help out in mosques and homes as much as she used to, Rini tries her best to volunteer at Jamiyah’s other outreach activities whenever the opportunity arises.Asked if these volunteering activities take away precious personal time from her, she answers, “I have never really seen volunteering as an activity that will take up my personal time… Because I see that as my personal time.”She adds, “I really enjoy the satisfaction after meeting the beneficiaries and helping them out.”Asked about her hopes for young people like herself, she says she hopes more will join her in stepping up and giving back to society.And it doesn’t have to be grand gestures, she says.“If we see an elderly person downstairs, feeling alone, we can make their day just by sitting down with them, talking to them. You don’t have to be an active volunteer, going door to door, meeting a lot of people.”“The smallest act of kindness can go a long way.”Photo credit: Jamiyah SingaporeWhile COVID-19 has been dubbed the crisis of a generation, Rini believes that the key for Singaporeans to bounce back from it is to be united in our efforts, and to stand by one another. While she acknowledges it is a tough period for young people now, especially those who are still without a job, her hope for her peers is that they would not lose sight of their goals and what they want to achieve.“Opportunities do exist, even in this current situation.”“Keep an open mind, be kind and compassionate to others, because you don’t know what they may be going through. Help other people – who knows, you may be helping yourself as well.”Volunteering her time has served as a reminder for Rini to always remain grateful for everything she has been blessed with in life.Her message to her fellow youth: “I certainly hope that volunteering will have the same impact on you too!”This article is part of a series of stories of Singaporean youth who have come forward to help the community, during this fight against COVID-19.

       " {'text': 'keeping you safe by keeping you apart About 3,000 Enforcement Officers, and SG Clean and Safe DistancingAmbassadors have been walking the ground every day since April 2020. They keeppeople in Singapore safe by making sure that those outside of their homes weartheir masks properly, and keep a safe distancefrom one another.The Ambassadors comprise officers from 65 public agencies as well asthose from private sectors whose usual jobs have been disruptedby COVID-19,like cabin crew and tour guides, and volunteers.Even though the Circuit Breaker period is over, they will still be doingtheir jobs in Phases One and Two as Singapore adopts a phased approachtoresume activities gradually and safely.Here are some of their stories. Sharon Loh, 37, Jetstar Asia air stewardessArea:F&B Outlets\"I am a Safe Distancing Ambassador who covers mainly F&B outlets like cafes, restaurants, coffeeshops in the central area including Bugis, Tiong Bahru, Telok Ayer, Lau Pa Sat and Marina Boulevard.Our focus is not only the people who are coming in for takeaways, but the F&B operators, including kitchens and counter staff. We want to make sure that they are wearing masks at all times and are observing safe distancing.For the kitchens, we go on “surprise” visits where we walk in and say “Excuse me, can I check your kitchen?” Those in the kitchens sometimes do not cover their mouths and noses properly because they are not seen.I understand it’s hot. But when we explain to them that it’s a precaution to prevent virus transmission as they cannot avoid contact with fellow workers completely, and that the last thing they want is for a new COVID-19 cluster to form in their establishment, they comply.What I am doing now is similar to what I was doing as a Jetstar Asia cabin crew for 13 years – I told people how to stay safe too, like putting on their safety belts or stowing their luggage safely. It’s just that now I share safety messages while on the ground.I became a Safe Distancing Ambassador after the company temporarily suspended its operations in March 2020, which left me and my colleagues feeling unsettled. Thankfully, Jetstar Asia helped many of us to secure temporary jobs to tide over this period. Many of my cabin crew colleagues are stationed at other frontline spots including temperature screening at hospitals, contact tracing centres, and foreign worker dormitories.My training means I am not afraid to approach strangers from all walks of life, address them appropriately, and politely remind them about the guidelines. I am never fierce, and everyone has been cooperative.In fact, many of the F&B operators are thankful that we went down personally to guide them. They admire our courage in being out and about on the frontline!I have also gained friends, as I become familiar with the F&B operators whom I see often. I have learnt much more about delicious food in the areas I have been patrolling, which I never knew about.Since I started this role in March, I also find that people have become used to safe distancing, and are automatically doing it on their own without my having to say anything. It has become part and parcel of daily life.\" Amanda Ng, 26, manager working in the Conservation division at NParksArea: Parks \"I patrol Bukit Batok Nature Park and Bukit Batok Town Park to ensure that people wear their masks, comply with safe distancing measures, and are not exercising in groups or with people from different households.I also help with drone operations, which are used to monitor visitorship levels in parks and other green areas managed by NParks.I fly drones in the larger parks and nature reserves to take photos of the grounds. The parks I fly the drones in include Bukit Batok Nature Park, Bukit Timah Nature Reserve and Zhenghua Nature Park.Doing so provides us with a high vantage point to obtain visitorship numbers in these locations, which is used to update the Safe Distance @ Park portal (safedistparks.nparks.gov.sg), which the public can use to look for a park near their homes that is less crowded before leaving their house to exercise. Before the Circuit Breaker period, I usually only saw regulars with a few new faces. Now, we see a lot more people who are new to the parks. The demographic of our park users is also a lot more diverse, from mainly elderly people in the past to more youths now.The most memorable moment for me was when we chanced upon a homeless uncle sitting on a rock at the Bukit Batok Town Park, who had been sleeping rough.We helped him by giving him masks so he would not have to re-wear his old one, chatted with him and got in touch with a social worker who managed to find him temporary shelter.Last I heard, he is adjusting well.The most difficult part of the job is explaining to park users why certain measures are in place. Some park users would try to argue their way out or feign ignorance.We have to patiently explain to them that the measures are in place for their own health and safety, as well as that of others.My colleagues and I are happy to play our part so that the public could come to our parks to stretch their legs and get some fresh air and exercise, especially during the Circuit Breaker period.\" Ow Tai Wee, 40, Banquet ManagerArea:Hawker Centres\"Since I started on 24 April 2020, I have been assigned to various hawker centres in the East, such as the Bedok Food Centre, East Coast Lagoon Food Village and Block 58 New Upper Changi Road.I am an SG Clean Ambassador deployed to help with safe distancing work. I work between 12pm and 9pm with an hour’s break in between.I remind stallholders and patrons, who comprise young adults, the elderly and families, to wear their masks correctly, and for patrons to maintain a safe distance of 1m apart, especially during the peak hours.The job can get quite challenging especially during the peak hours of 3 - 6pm when long queues can form within minutes.It is also difficult for patrons to maintain a safe distance of 1m when queuing within the confined space of a hawker centre.To overcome this, our team members taped additional floor markings with visible arrow signs to guide patrons on how they should queue. When I was working as a banquet manager, I spent most of my time in the hotel and was not subject to the weather. Hence, my first day as a SG Clean Ambassador was quite memorable. It was raining heavily. As I was outdoors, my feet got wet. Since then, I always have an extra pair of socks with me.Thankfully, most members of the public are quite supportive and cooperative when approached by us to practise safe distancing and I look forward to going to work every day.At times, when members of the public encourage or thank me for my contribution, I feel happy that my efforts are recognised. I also feel a sense of fulfilment as I played my part to help make the Circuit Breaker measures a success.\"', 'id': 'caa6da34-0558-472c-9639-df6f546979d5', 'score': None, 'probability': None, 'question': None, 'meta': {'category': 'articles'}, 'embedding': None},\n",
       " {'text': 'containing covid 19 spread at foreign worker dormitories Watch video in English| Bengali |Chinese | Malay | Tamil Excerpt from PM Lee’s address to nation on 10 Apr 2020We have seen outbreaks in several foreign worker dormitories. Many dorms have cases, and some dorms have many cases. We have responded comprehensively to contain the spread in the dorms, and to protect the foreign workers.Yesterday, Ministers Lawrence Wong and Gan Kim Yong explained what we are doing. They have set up an interagency task force to handle the situation in the dorms. Ministry of Health, Ministry of Manpower, the SAF, the Home Team, all are involved. The commander of the task force is the Chief Guards Officer from the Army, and Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean is advising the ministers on this issue.The task force has deployed Forward Assurance and Support Teams in all the dorms. These teams work closely with the dorm operators and can respond quickly to the workers’ essential needs. They are setting up medical facilities and triage clinics, bringing in supplies and food, and managing the logistics and housekeeping. They are making sure the workers have food and water, and WiFi to keep in touch with families back home and friends here, and for entertainment. The SAF and the Home Team have the resources and the organisation to do this. Many other public service agencies are also chipping in.We are paying close attention to the welfare of the foreign workers. They came to Singapore to work hard for a living, and provide for their families back home. They have played an important part building our HDB flats, Changi Airport, MRT lines. We have worked with their employers to make sure they will be paid their salaries, and can remit money home. We will provide them with the medical care and treatment that they need. Containment of spreadAs of 13 April 2020, Acacia Lodge, Cochrane Lodge I, Cochrane Lodge II, Tampines Dormitory, Sungei Tengah Lodge, Toh Guan Dormitory, S11 Dormitory @ Punggol (\"S11\") and Westlite (Toh Guan) Dormitory have been gazetted as isolation areas due to a large number of COVID-19 cases.Workers who are symptomatic have already been isolated.Protecting Foreign Workers who are wellAll foreign workers in the affected dorms will not go to work.Access to recreational facilities will be regulated to reduce the inter-mixing. They will also not be allowed to move between blocks.Workers have also been advised not to interact with others who do not reside in the same room or floor.All resident workers have received care packs consisting of masks, thermometers and hand sanitisers.All affected workers will be taken care ofMOM is working closely with the dorm operators to ensure that the affected workers will be taken care of: Salaries - they will continue to be paid salaries for the duration of the quarantine. The period of absence from work will be treated as paid hospitalisation leave. To provide relief to employers, the government will waive levies due in April and provide a one-off levy rebate of $750 to employers. In view of this support, employers of foreign work permit and S Pass holders will not be eligible for the daily allowance paid to employers of quarantined workers. This supersedes the Government’s earlier statement regarding the daily quarantine allowance. Daily needs will be provided – three meals a day by professional caterers, reusable masks, thermometers, hand sanitisers, and other essentials. Medical - Onsite medical support has been deployed to support the workers in both dormitories.Enhanced health screening measures are also in place, with temperature checking and regular monitoring for fever and respiratory symptoms. Those who are unwell will be provided with prompt medical treatment.Enhanced waste management and sanitation regimesCleaning of dorms has been intensified. The frequency of refuse collection and removal from the premises for disposal have been increased from once a day to three to five times daily, depending on the premises.The disinfection and cleaning of the common areas and washroom facilities are also carried out on an average of three times per day.As this will be a big adjustment for the affected workers, MOM will ensure that those who are affected will be provided the necessary support.Read more: Additional measures to minimise further spread of COVID-19 within foreign worker dormitories (5 Apr 2020) Efforts to ensure well-being of foreign workers at S11 Dormitory @ Punggol and Westlite Toh Guan (6 Apr 2020) Inter-Agency Taskforce to support foreign workers and dormitory operators during circuit breaker period (7 Apr 2020) Update on Conditions at Three Dormitories Gazetted as Isolation Areas (8 Apr 2020) Further improvements in distribution process and quality of food for dormitories gazetted as isolation areas (9 Apr 2020) Enhanced cleanliness and sanitation measures at dormitories gazetted as isolation areas (10 Apr 2020) Food distribution, cleanliness and hygiene standards at Sungei Tengah Lodge and Tampines Dormitory stabilised within 48 hours (11 Apr 2020) Key actions to manage transmission of COVID-19 in all dormitories (14 Apr 2020)Resources for dorm operators and workersWatch video in other languagesEnglish |Bengali | Chinese | Tamil #link-blue { color: #105cb6; } Workers at Dormitories English: PDF / JPEG Chinese: PDF / JPEG Bengali: PDF / JPEG Tamil: PDF / JPEG', 'id': 'e6653691-ba81-42f7-9979-0f78d1630576', 'score': None, 'probability': None, 'question': None, 'meta': {'category': 'articles'}, 'embedding': None},\n",
       " {'text': 'improved standards of new dormitories for migrant workers As more migrant workers are recovering from COVID-19 or being cleared to resume work, the Inter-agency Taskforce (ITF) is currently working with dormitory operators and employers on the housing arrangements for these workers.Currently, some workers have been housed temporarily in sites such as army camps and sports halls, as well as vacant HDB blocks and private apartments slated for redevelopment.To reduce the current density in the dormitories, the Government will be building additional dormitories with higher standards over the coming months and years. Short-to Medium-Term ArrangementsBy the end of 2020, additional space to house around 60,000 workers will be created through the following: New Quick Build Dormitories (QBDs), which are temporary structures that can be constructed quite quickly with a low density. These dormitories will last for around two or three years, and can house about 25,000 people in total. Unused state properties, including former schools and vacant factories, will be temporarily fitted out to house around 25,000 people in total. The Government is in discussion with contractors on building additional Construction Temporary Quarters (CTQs) to house their workers near the worksite and cut down on the need for transportation. Longer-Term ArrangementsMoving forward, there are plans for new purpose-built dormitories (PBDs) to house up to 100,000 workers, which will replace the temporary accommodations built this year. This new building programme will take several years to complete, with the aim of having 11 new PBDs ready over the next one to two years.All of these dormitories will have amenities like minimarts, barber services, indoor recreation facilities, and blocks will be well spaced out to ensure good ventilation. Workers living in these dormitories will have ready access to medical care and support.With the additional housing capacity in place, the Government will be able to decant workers from existing dormitories, and undertake major upgrading of these dormitories to ensure that the new standards are met.Improved standards and dorm operating model will be pilotedA set of standards and specifications will be developed for the new dormitories, which will look into the design, facilities, management and regulation of these dormitories, and will factor in social interaction and disease response needs.These efforts aim to make dormitory living and design more resilient to public health risks, including pandemics. Lessons learnt from the current COVID pandemic will be taken in, with feedback sought from relevant stakeholders.These improved standards will be piloted in the upcoming quick build dormitories (QBDs): Living space per resident: at least 6 sqm (not including shared facilities), from at least 4.5 sqm per resident (including shared facilities) currently. Maximum of 10 beds per room, where only single deck beds will be used with 1m spacing between the beds. Currently, there are no limits on the occupancy per room. In practice, dormitories typically have 12-16 beds per room, with mostly double decker beds. One toilet, bathroom and sink to every 5 beds, an improvement from every 15 beds currently. More sick bay beds – at least 15 per 1,000 bed spaces. An improvement from the current requirement of just one sick bay bed per 1,000 bed spaces.The Government is also studying the possibility of developing the purpose-built dormitories on a different model compared to the present system, where currently land is released for commercial operators to bid, build, or operate.Everyone has a part to playWhile physical standards are being improved, it is also important to uplift the capabilities of dormitory operators and adjust the daily living habits of dormitory residents. The pilot aims to instil a new level of discipline on safe living within dormitories.The additional and improved housing arrangements is expected to come at a cost, which is necessary to keep workers safe and allow Singaporeans to continue benefiting from their contributions. Adjustments may be made for permanent new dormitories based on the pilot’s effectiveness, scalability, and sustainability.Given Singapore’s land constraints, some dormitories will be located closer to residential areas. This will require the support from Singaporeans as well, in appreciating the workers who keep Singapore going.

       " {'text': 'factually clarifications on falsehood posted by sst on covid 19 cases in schools There is a false statement of fact contained in a Facebook post by Singapore States Times (SST) on COVID-19 cases in schools.FalsehoodOn 4 May 2020, SST published a Facebook post stating that “Education Minister Ong Ye Kung is responsible for numerous infections in schools after he refused to close down the schools. The schools were only closed on April 3rd, but at least 50 students and teachers were already infected.” These statements imply that at least 50 students and teachers had become infected with COVID-19 by 3 April 2020 as a result of transmission in schools, which is false.As of 3 April 2020, 69 students and staff in MOE schools, including the Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs), were reported to have been infected with COVID-19. Based on contact tracing and investigations by MOH, all the cases (except for 3 which are still unlinked) were attributed to transmission via overseas travel, within households, social settings, and a non-school workplace (for a part-time student). In short, none of the 69 infections were traced back to MOE schools, including the IHLs.Additional ClarificationsEven before the implementation of Full Home-Based Learning (HBL) as part of the broader national Circuit Breaker measures, our schools and teachers have put in tremendous effort to ensure that our students can learn in a safe environment. Precautionary measures included establishing new hygiene and cleaning routines for our students, fixed seating and assigned play areas, suspension of co-curricular activities, and placing students who are unwell, have a travel history, or who stay with family members who have a travel history, on a Leave of Absence.As part of the national Circuit Breaker measures, schools were closed and we moved to Full HBL on 8 April 2020. With most parents telecommuting from home, the closure of schools did not become a major disruption to our lives. Although students no longer attend school physically, the restrictions in place prevented them from moving around the community freely and exposing themselves to the virus. Nevertheless, a major concern with school closure is our students from vulnerable backgrounds, who need the support of schools for lessons, meals and guidance. These students, together with students whose parents work in essential services, have therefore been allowed to come back to school for care and supervision, with the necessary safe distancing measures in place. The arrangements for these students will continue during the May school holidays. If MOE had simply closed schools early, say from Feb 2020, we would have disrupted lives significantly, and the impact on students from vulnerable backgrounds would have been immense. Instead, we have kept schools open as long as possible, while keeping our students safe.', 'id': '12891997-922a-46b4-8d54-db1deb3253e4', 'score': None, 'probability': None, 'question': None, 'meta': {'category': 'articles'}, 'embedding': None},\n",

       " {'text': 'pm lee hsien loong overcoming the crisis of a generation PM Lee spoke about the impact of COVID-19 on Singapore. It is not only a public health issue, but also a serious economic, social and political problem. The Government has intervened through four successive Budgets to protect workers, households and companies. However, these measures cannot shield us from tectonic shifts in the global economy. But we can be confident. Singapore has economic strengths and an international reputation built up over many decades, and a head start preparing for uncertainties with future economy strategies. We are rebuilding transport and trade links, and making our supply chains more resilient. We are also working to retain and attract talent and investments to contribute to our recovery. The Government’s priority is to help Singaporeans keep jobs or find new ones. We have to strengthen our social compact and improve our social safety nets. For Singapore to succeed, we need the unity and resilience of our people. Full transcript:My fellow Singaporeans,Good evening.Our fight against COVID-19 continues.We have made good progress. In the community, new cases have come down. In the migrant worker dormitories, the situation has stabilised. Our healthcare system is coping well, thanks to the outstanding work of our healthcare professionals, and many others on the frontline. Most importantly, among both Singaporeans and migrant workers, we have kept fatalities low – one of the lowest rates in the world.As a result, we have been able to move out of the circuit breaker. We are opening up our economy and society, progressively and safely. As we ease up, I expect the number of cases to rise somewhat, as has happened in other countries. So we are moving cautiously. We want to avoid the numbers shooting up again, and having to impose a second circuit breaker. We will step up testing and contact tracing significantly. Then we can catch new cases early, isolate them and their contacts, and stamp out clusters before they grow. If all goes well and the outbreak remains firmly under control, we will ease up further, and resume more activities as soon as possible. In the meantime, please continue to play your part: maintain personal hygiene and wash your hands frequently, wear a mask when you are out, and keep a safe distance from others and avoid crowded gatherings. COVID-19 will remain a problem for a long time yet. It will take at least a year, probably longer, before vaccines become widely available. We will have to learn to live with COVID-19 for the long term, as we have done in the past with other dangerous infectious diseases, like tuberculosis. We also have to get used to new arrangements in our daily lives. We must all adjust the way we live, work and play, so that we can reduce the spread of the virus, and keep ourselves safe.Economic ImpactBut COVID-19 is not only a public health issue. It is also a serious economic, social and political problem. It is in fact the most dangerous crisis humanity has faced in a very long time.Because of COVID-19, the global economy has virtually ground to a halt. Governments have spent trillions of dollars to support businesses, economies and jobs. Yet, tens of millions of jobs have been lost. Families are experiencing hardship. We are in a totally unprecedented situation.Singapore has taken a severe hit too. Our GDP is likely to shrink between 4 and 7% this year, our worst contraction ever. To protect workers, households and companies, the Government has intervened decisively through four successive Budgets. We are injecting almost $100 billion – 20% of our GDP – the largest fiscal intervention in our history. Unlike other countries, we can draw on our reserves, and do not have to pay for our support measures by borrowing. But even for us, this level of spending is hard to sustain. More importantly, these measures cannot shield us from the tectonic shifts taking place in the global economy.Singapore depends heavily on international trade and investments. These were already slowing down before COVID-19. Now this slowdown will happen faster, and go further.We will not be returning to the open and connected global economy we had before, anytime soon. Movement of people will be more restricted. International travel will be much less frequent. Health checks and quarantines will become the norm. It will no longer be so easy to take quick weekend trips to Bangkok or Hong Kong on a budget flight. Industries that depend on travel, like aviation, hotels and tourism, will take a long time to get back on their feet, and may never recover fully.Countries will also strive to become less dependent on others. Especially for essential goods and services, like food or critical medical supplies. This will have strategic implications. Countries will have less stake in each other’s well being. They will fight more over how the pie is shared, rather than work together to enlarge the pie for all. It will be a less prosperous world, and also a more troubled one. All these developments will affect Singapore greatly. Since before the time of Raffles, we have made a living by connecting ourselves with the world. First, we were a trading hub, then an international seaport, then we made ourselves a hub for aviation, finance, and telecommunications. We have benefitted enormously from an open and connected global economy. Large parts of our economy – like manufacturing, biotech, financial services, and logistics – serve regional and world markets. Even many domestic sectors – like retail, F&B, and entertainment – rely heavily on tourism.Now, we have to prepare for a very different future. Companies big and small will be hit hard. Some industries will be permanently changed. Many will have to reinvent themselves to survive. Workers too will feel the pain. Retrenchments and unemployment will go up. Some jobs will disappear, and will not come back. Workers will have to learn new skills to stay employed. The next few years will be a disruptive and difficult time for all of us.We Can Be ConfidentBut despite these immense challenges, I say to you: Do not fear. Do not lose heart. Singapore will not falter in its onward march.I believe we can still secure a bright future for ourselves. An even stronger and better Singapore will emerge from this crisis.First, we have economic strengths and an international reputation built up over many decades. We are highly connected to the global flows of trade, investment, capital and people. International trade and investments may shrink, but they will not disappear entirely. Some flows will be diverted or dry up, but other new channels will open up. There will still be overseas markets, and opportunities for international partnerships. Singapore is well placed to connect ourselves to the new channels and flows, and create new businesses and jobs to replace those lost. We just have to work harder and smarter at it. Our strong, trusted international reputation will help us greatly. In a troubled world, investors will value the assurance of a government that plays by the rules. A people who understand what is at stake and a stable political system that enables businesses to continue operating even in a crisis. The way Singapore has responded to COVID-19 – openly and transparently, neither avoiding reality, nor acting arbitrarily at the first sign of trouble – has only strengthened this advantage.Second, we have had a head start preparing for the uncertainties ahead. For some time now, we have been working hard to transform and deepen our capabilities. Developing plans for our Future Economy, investing heavily to upgrade our workers through SkillsFuture, digitalising both the private and public sectors, building our innovation and R&D capabilities. All this has enabled us to stand out in Asia and the world. Nobody can predict what exactly the world will look like after COVID-19 but however things turn out, these Future Economy strategies will stand us in good stead. We need to pursue them even more vigorously now. For instance, we know that many businesses will no longer be viable. We will support these businesses to transform themselves, change their business models, or move into different and more promising fields. More immediately, we are systematically rebooting our economy, as countries emerge from lockdowns. We are rebuilding our transport and trade links. For example, Changi has already resumed transit flights. We are working out Reciprocal Green Lane arrangements for safe travel to China and other countries. We are making our supply chains more resilient. For example, we are diversifying our sources of food. We are even buying eggs from Poland, and shrimps from Saudi Arabia.Next, we are working hard to retain and attract talent and investments to contribute to our to our recovery. At a time when some countries are closing their doors, we are keeping ours open. By making the most of our head start, our workers and industries will survive the crisis better, and bounce back faster and stronger. Third, we have programmes and plans to cope with the challenges before us. The government’s biggest priority now is jobs – helping Singaporeans to keep their jobs, or find new ones. We are particularly concerned about those in their 40s and 50s, who are often supporting children and elderly parents at the same time, and have financial commitments to meet. We are also concerned about mature workers nearing retirement, who want to work for a few more years, to build up their nest egg for old age. Lower income workers, who have not much savings to fall back on. The self-employed and freelancers, who have less jobs and income security in the gig economy and fresh graduates who are entering the job market in a very difficult year.We have schemes to help all these groups. The Job Support Scheme, the Workfare Special Payment, the Self-Employed Person Income Relief Scheme (SIRS), the COVID-19 Support Grant and the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Package. These schemes have enabled people to hold on to their jobs, and provided income support for millions of Singaporeans and their families.We have set up a National Jobs Council, to pull together and drive all our efforts on jobs, and look at how we can create new jobs for the economy. Senior Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam is leading this. The Council will coordinate all the Government agencies involved, and bring in NTUC and the employer groups too, to maximise the impact of our efforts. So if you need a job, there are real options to pursue, and you will have help and support. Beyond COVID-19, and the economic challenges, we also have to deal with other important external and domestic issues. Externally, we have to navigate the changing strategic landscape. COVID-19 has worsened relations between the US and China. Actions and counter-actions are raising tensions day by day. It will become harder for countries to stay onside with both powers. It will be a more dangerous world for a small country like Singapore. We must ensure our security, and protect and advance our interests when dealing with other countries, big and small. We must also work with like-minded countries to support free trade and multilateralism, and enhance our voice and influence in the world. Domestically, we have to strengthen our social compact. We have taken emergency measures to help everyone come through the crisis together. Beyond that, we have to think carefully how to improve our social safety nets. Sustainable social support will give people confidence to cope with the uncertainties and to make changes to their lives. At the same time, everyone must have the incentive to be self-reliant, and to progress through their own efforts. We have difficult decisions to make on priorities, resources, and budgets but the values guiding us remain the same: every Singaporean will have equal opportunities. Whatever your starting point in life, you will have access to good education, healthcare, and housing. If you fall down, we will help you to get up, stronger. You can be sure you will be taken care of. In Singapore, no one will be left to walk his journey alone.In the next few weeks, several Ministers will address you, and share with you our plans. We have a full agenda for many years to come. Our People are Our StrengthFor our plans to succeed, for our hopes and dreams to come true, we need one final ingredient: the unity and resilience of our people. Once in a while, nations and peoples are severely tested, as we are now. Some buckle under pressure and emerge from crisis diminished. Others grow more determined as they face fearful odds, discover reserves of strength in themselves, and emerge from crisis transfigured, renewed. And that has been our Singapore story: in crises, we have never failed to wrest opportunity from danger.Indeed, our nation was born in crisis. When we were granted independence, it was in the expectation that we would fail and come crawling back, after realising we could not survive alone. We proved otherwise. Two years later, the British suddenly announced that they were withdrawing their forces from Singapore. Again, many thought that would be the end of us. And again, we proved them wrong. The Pioneer Generation fought to master their destiny. And the Merdeka Generation put heart and soul into making Singapore succeed. Together, they weathered many storms, always looking ahead, never flinching at hard choices and challenges. And that is how we got here.Now, at another hinge in our history, it is our turn to face the crisis of a generation. The choices that we make now will define who we are as a people, and what values and ideals we pass on to future generations. Confronting adversity, do we yield to anger, fear and bitterness? Or will we be true to ourselves, stand firm, make tough choices, and continue to trust and depend on one another.Many Singaporeans have stepped up during this crisis. They have become more, not less, than themselves. Healthcare workers, public officers, grassroots leaders and volunteers, and many more working quietly behind the scenes. Some are taking good care of migrant workers in the dorms. Others are sewing masks, buying groceries for families under quarantine, or refurbishing computers for needy students to do Home-Based Learning. Abroad, Singaporeans have driven hundreds of kilometres to pick up fellow citizens to catch SQ flights home. These acts of solidarity and human kindness exemplify the best in us. They show how we can emerge stronger from this crisis, with a sharper consciousness of being Singaporean. This is why I believe we can continue to be exceptional – a fair and just society, where everyone can chase their dreams. My Cabinet team, with the support of the whole public service, will do our best to lead us towards this enduring vision of what Singapore can be. We need every one of you to work with us. Together, let us take Singapore safely through this crisis, and make the Singapore spirit flourish in the world.Thank you.…..From 7 to 20 June 2020, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat, Senior Ministers Teo Chee Hean and Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Minister Chan Chun Sing and Minister Lawrence Wong will deliver a series of national broadcasts, explaining what a post-COVID-19 future looks like for Singapore.Click here for the other speeches.', 'id': '4872cc1a-8f8f-4f9b-b299-ddcb37bdf9f4', 'score': None, 'probability': None, 'question': None, 'meta': {'category': 'articles'}, 'embedding': None},\n",
       " {'text': 'tips for battling stress and anxiety during covid 19 Some of us have never lived through a crisis like COVID-19, and may find it difficult to handle the pandemic mentally and emotionally.Trained psychiatrist Lieutenant-Colonel (Dr) Soh Teck Hwee recently volunteered with the National CARE Hotline, which was set up to support people who feel stressed and anxious about the evolving COVID-19 pandemic.Dr Soh, who is also a member of the Singapore Armed Forces Medical Corps, provided a listening ear and dispensed advice to hotline callers who needed emotional support.Is it normal to feel stressed during this COVID-19 pandemic?Yes. It is normal to feel concerned, worried, anxious and even mildly depressed. These are unprecedented times for Singapore residents and it is important that their emotional and psychological health are being taken care of.The 24/7 National CARE Hotline complements existing support measures – such as phone or online counselling platforms – by providing additional emotional support and psychological first aid to individuals who may be distressed and in need of mental health and psychosocial support.During my volunteer stint, people who called the hotline had a range of concerns – some experienced negative emotions, while others had challenges in daily living such as financial hardship, as well as fears of domestic violence.We provided a listening ear and comforted the callers and, for most of them, these were sufficient. We also connected them to information and avenues of help, such as financial assistance or caregiver facilities for those struggling with caring for elderly family members.How do I tell if I am stressed?People may not know that they are stressed, or that what they are feeling or doing is a result of stress. Stress can affect how we feel, how we think and how we behave. Some possible symptoms include:Mental Having a loss of concentration Being more forgetful Having difficulty making decisions Physical Feeling more tired Having unexplained aches Having rapid breathing and heart rate Emotional Being short-tempered Getting irritated more easily Being more prone to worrying or tearfulness Children and elderly may show stress in different ways. For instance, children might refuse to play, become clingy, or suffer from poor sleep.How can I cope with anxiety and stress? Don’t bottle up your feelings. Recognise the symptoms and accept your feelings. Connect with others, either within your household or with friends online or over the phone, and express your emotions. It is important to continue to self-care. Keep exercising, eat regular healthy meals and keep to your normal bedtime even if you do not have to go to work the next day. If you find that your mood is worsening and you are having increasing difficulty coping with the pandemic, it is important to seek help early. Do not rely on alcohol or other maladaptive coping mechanisms like drugs of abuse.Please call the 24-hour National CARE Hotline and speak with our trained counsellors who can help you process your feelings and guide you through practical and healthy coping tactics.What can I do to support my loved ones if they are showing signs of anxiety and stress?One simple step is to acknowledge the concerns and provide simple reassurance or instil hope. For example, for someone facing financial difficulties, you could say “I know we may lose our income and things could be hard over the next few months but let’s take it one step at a time together to see what can be done\".If you are a frontline worker and your family is worried for your health, you could assure them, \"I know you are worried about me, and you are right to be worried. I will take the necessary precautions and look after myself\". Need Help? Call 1800-202-6868 If you are feeling stressed, anxious or alone and you need to talk to a trained professional, the National CARE Hotline is open 24/7.

Agri-Food Cluster Transformation Fund $60 million has been set aside to further support tech adoption in the agri-food sector. Changing the future of transportEmissions can be reduced by going car-lite, as well as by switching to cleaner-energy vehicles. Electric vehicle (EV)-related initiatives $30 million will be set aside over five years for initiatives such as developing charging infrastructure. The Government aims to deploy 60,000 charging points at public carparks and private premises by 2030. To encourage the adoption of electric cars The Government will narrow the cost difference between EVs and internal combustion engine cars, e.g. lowering the Additional Registration Fee floor to zero from Jan 2022 to Dec 2023,and revising the road tax treatment for electric cars. To discourage the use of internal combustion engine vehicles Petrol duty rates will be raised by 15 cents per litre for premium petrol and 10 cents per litre for intermediate petrol. To offset the petrol duty increase: Motorcycles using petrol will be given a 60% road tax rebate. Individual owners of smaller motorcycles up to 400cc will receive a petrol duty rebate of $50, or $80 in cash Active taxi and Private Hire Car Drivers using petrol and petrol-hybrid vehicles will be given a petrol duty rebate of $360 over 4 months, on top of 15% road tax rebate Goods vehicles and buses using petrol will receive 100% road tax rebate Cars using petrol will receive 15% road tax rebate Green financingGreen finance is an important enabler for sustainability efforts. The Government will issue green bonds on selected public infrastructure projects to catalyse the flow of capital towards sustainable development in Singapore and Asia.Up to $19 billion of public sector green projects have been identified to be financed with green bonds as a start. One such project is Tuas Nexus, which integrates waste and water treatment facilities, and maximises energy and resource recovery in the solid waste and used water treatment processes.A whole-of-society effortThe public sector will take the lead in the Environmental Sustainability Initiatives. This includes reducing electricity and water consumption, achieving the Green Mark standard for buildings and committing to goals under the “GreenGov.SG” initiative.Businesses and households are encouraged to also play their part.

       " {'text': 'the science behind why masks help prevent covid 19 spread Using laser beams and a high-speed, high-sensitivity camera to “see” the tiny droplets which are produced when we cough, it can be seen that when a mask is properly worn, little or no droplets are released into the atmosphere.The experiment was conducted by scientists from the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) and in consultation with doctors from the Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Infectious Diseases and Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, to test the effectiveness of masks in reducing the spread of respiratory droplets.Executive Director Professor Alfred Huan, and Principal Scientist and Director of Strategic Research Office Assoc Prof Loh Xian Jun, from A*STAR’s Institute of Materials Research and Engineering (IMRE), led the experiment, which was carried out in a dark room, and in which the area outside of the subject was lighted up with parabolic mirrors.What can our scientists deduce based on their findings? When people are sick and cough or sneeze without wearing a mask, the droplets they produce which contain viruses can travel 2-3m away. If these droplets land on someone else’s face, or a surface which is touched by someone else, it may make the person sick. Heavier, larger droplets drop to the ground while the smaller droplets appear to drift in the air Other environmental factors like humidity, temperature and even wind speed would also affect how the droplets travel.But when any type of mask is properly worn over the nose and mouth, most if not all droplets are blocked from getting out into the air or landing on someone else.That is why it is critical for people to wear masks to stop the spread of COVID-19, especially given the possibility that there are people who have the coronavirus in their bodies and can spread it, but are not showing any symptoms. One of the doctors involved in the experiment, Professor Tan Ban Hock, Senior Consultant at the Department of Infectious Diseases, Singapore General Hospital, said, “Wearing a mask is therefore important, as it serves as a mechanical barrier to the dispersion of droplets.”Masks lose effectiveness if not worn properlyThe experiment also showed that the mask must be worn properly. Minute droplets escape if the mask does not cover the nose.Prof Huan stated, “When the mask only covers the mouth and not the nose, some droplets are ejected into the air due to the loose fit. The efficacy of the mask in curbing the spread of droplets is dependent on how the mask is worn.”While the team did not investigate the effectiveness of different types of masks, Assoc Prof Loh stated, “A simple cloth mask is effective in curbing the spread of droplets from inside-out. That is, it protects those around the person coughing.”', 'id': 'fbe4247b-ed92-4e59-8bff-d9818a94494c', 'score': None, 'probability': None, 'question': None, 'meta': {'category': 'articles'}, 'embedding': None},\n",
       " {'text': 'govsg how tos how to keep safe if you must return to the office Working from home must remain the default for all businesses where feasible. This, along with video and tele-conferencing instead of physical meetings, would allow us to keep safe by keeping COVID-19 transmissions low.If you must go back to the workplace, however, here are five top tips for keeping safe:1) Stagger work and break hours Adopt safe management measures at your workplace to ensure a safe environment for you and your colleagues. This includes staggered work and break hours such as shift or split team arrangements. On top of these measures, you should avoid mixing between teams. These allow for the reduction of physical contact, lowering the likelihood of workplace transmissions.2) Avoid socialising with colleagues and sit at least 1 metre apart Some would be excited to reunite with your favourite colleagues after a long and isolating period of working from home – we are too! However, try to dine alone and minimise physical contact with colleagues from other teams in and out of work as much as possible. Should you dine with others, avoid sharing food and cutlery, using a serving spoon if necessary. Remember that the 1 metre safe distance continues to apply in Phase 2, in and out of your workplace!3) Maintain good personal hygiene Practising safe distancing is important but not enough to keep the community safe. Remember to wear a face mask even at the workplace and continue to wash and sanitise your hands regularly. Apart from keeping yourself clean, take time to disinfect common surfaces and high-touch surfaces (e.g. phones, keyboards, switches, doorknobs). These good personal hygiene practices would keep yourself and the people around you safe. Public health is literally in your hands!4) Use SafeEntry and TraceTogether We need to do our part to speed up contact tracing and minimise transmission as we ease restrictions. Check in and out on SafeEntry diligently and download the TraceTogether app to help establish potential clusters. With technology, this can be done quickly– a small price to pay to lend a tremendous helping hand to our contact tracing effort!5) Stay home if you are sickIf you develop any COVID-19 symptoms, be sure to wear a surgical mask and see a doctor immediately. Keep to one doctor as much as you can – do not ‘doctor hop’. Most importantly, keep safe by not going to work. It’s better to be safe than sorry!For more tips on how to keep safe in Phase 2 and beyond, check out the Gov.sg How-Tos.', 'id': '45ccc5bf-5c0b-47b2-b070-14422268a8d8', 'score': None, 'probability': None, 'question': None, 'meta': {'category': 'articles'}, 'embedding': None},\n",

On 5 Aug 2020, a 25-year-old became the 20th fatality in Singapore this year due to dengue.If you suspect you have dengue, check if you have the symptoms below, and look out for the warning signs that the infection is getting worse.Symptoms of dengueCommon symptoms of dengue fever are: Fever Headache with pain behind the eyes Muscle and joint aches Rash Poor appetite Nausea and vomitingRead more: Dengue: Know the symptoms and how to protect yourselfProgression of dengue & warning signsDengue is a dynamic disease – which means that its status changes rapidly over time. Phase 1: High feverDengue typically starts off with high fever, accompanied by body aches and pain. The fever typically lasted for 3-5 days.Phase 2: Critical period The second phase is known as the critical period, and it is the most crucial one to look out for. Your body temperature is coming down (below 38 degrees C), lasting for 48 hours.During this period, your body experiences fluid shifting out of circulation compartments to other body compartments. Fluid may then accumulate in the lungs or abdominal space.Your heart rate, blood pressure may fluctuate, and in severe cases, drop to very low levels that damage your vital organs, such as your kidney and liver.You should look out for these warning signs indicating that the infection is getting worse: Abdominal pain, that are not hunger pangs Persistent vomiting, even with just fluids Bleeding tendencies, such as: Blood in your vomit (i.e. red streaks of blood) Bleeding from your nose or gums Easy bruising Black and sticky (tar-like) stools Breathing difficultiesPhase 3: RecoveryAfter the critical period comes the recovery phase.During this period, fluids that have shifted out of circulation during the critical phase will return to circulation. In occasional cases, this can lead to fluid overload.What to do if you have dengueIf you suspect you have dengue fever, seek medical attention immediately.Based on your symptoms, the doctor will evaluate if further investigations, such as blood tests, are needed.', 'id': '85e3fef7-46b1-4f3d-9ef4-a6e9e145da9a', 'score': None, 'probability': None, 'question': None, 'meta': {'category': 'articles'}, 'embedding': None},\n",

       " {'text': 'national day message 2020 My fellow Singaporeans,Every year, rain or shine, Singaporeans come together on the 9th of August for the National Day Parade, to celebrate the making of our nation, and renew our commitment to Singapore.National Day ParadeI have been privileged to attend almost every NDP since the first in 1966. One of the Parades I took part in was in 1968 at the Padang. The rain poured down, but the contingents stood steady, and marched past proudly, drenched, yet undaunted. We showed ourselves and the world that Singaporeans were rugged people, and had the steel in us to stand firm in adversity. Five years ago, SG50 was another memorable Parade. We celebrated our Golden Jubilee, and what we had achieved in Singapore. We also paid tribute to our founding Prime Minister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew. We mourned his passing that year, but also affirmed what he and the pioneer leaders stood for. In good years, our parades rejoice in our progress, and look forward to a better future together.In difficult years, we still hold National Day Parades, to renew our resolve to weather the storm and take Singapore through to better days.This year, National Day falls amidst COVID-19. We are not able to celebrate in our usual way, but we are determined still to hold the Parade as a symbol of our unity as a nation, like we have done every year since independence. We will have a smaller Parade at the Padang, and also ceremonies at seven other locations around the island this morning. Each location will symbolise one aspect of our response to COVID-19 – Providing medical care for Singaporeans at NCID; supporting our workforce with skills and jobs at the Lifelong Learning Institute; keeping learning going for our students at North Vista Secondary School; or sustaining our community spirit at Kampung Admiralty. We look forward to Singaporeans across the island, and also in far-flung lands, joining the Parade virtually and celebrating with one another. We will all share special moments like when the Red Lions land, the mobile column reaches our town, or the State Flag is flown past. We will all recite the Pledge and sing Majulah Singapura in our hearts together.Stories of everyday heroesThis NDP is also an opportunity for us to salute those on our frontline, fighting COVID-19. Many of them have gone way beyond the call of duty, and shown great generosity of spirit. Retired doctors and nurses volunteered to come back, donning PPE to serve on the front lines, in hospitals and migrant worker dormitories. Full-time national servicemen extended their terms to continue supporting COVID-19 operations. Public officers volunteered to be redeployed to organise and look after the migrant workers. Many Singaporeans stepped up to help others in need. Some went door to door distributing meals and groceries to the elderly and low-income households. Others refurbished donated laptops for needy students, for home-based learning. Thousands of public-spirited Singaporeans volunteered to be trained for swab operations. They served in the hot zones, including the dormitories and community care facilities. Migrant workers too played their part to support these operations. Their help was deeply appreciated by our SAF, Home Team and public officers.These selfless acts have made all the difference to our response to COVID-19.Bracing for economic difficulties aheadWe will need this unity and resilience more than ever. The crisis is far from over. Many countries brought COVID-19 under control and eased restrictions, only to see their cases rise sharply again. This can happen to us too, despite all our precautions. It will most likely take a year or two before a vaccine is widely available, and the threat of the virus is blunted. Until then, we have to maintain our vigilance and resolve, to keep ourselves, our loved ones and our neighbours all safe. We also need to be resilient in the face of the severe economic downturn. Singaporeans are understandably anxious and worried. Business closures, retrenchments and unemployment are all likely to go up in the coming months.But this is not the first economic crisis we have experienced. Just in the last quarter century, we have seen the Asian Financial Crisis (1997-1998), the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks (2001), and the Global Financial Crisis (2007-2009). Each time the outlook was ominous, and we feared the worst, but each time we worked hard to secure our position, gritted our teeth, and came through together.I am confident we will get through this current crisis too, though it may take longer. All of us must do our part, but none of us will be alone. The government is actively helping people find new jobs and acquire new skills. We also have the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) and Self-employed person Income Relief Scheme (SIRS) to ease the burden on employers and individuals. The Labour Movement is working with employers to create job training programmes and career pathways. It will also ensure that every worker is treated fairly and with dignity, especially when job losses cannot be avoided. Employers too must make every effort to keep their workers, and not drop them at the first sign of trouble. This will build loyalty, and encourage the employees to help their employers rebuild when conditions improve.Our experience fighting COVID-19, grim and hard as it has been, has brought us closer together. The shared ordeal will toughen a whole population, and bond us together as one united people. Just like how the Pioneer and Merdeka Generations were tempered by Separation and Independence, and economic crises in our early years as a nation. Let us brace ourselves for the trials ahead, so that many years from now, when our grandchildren celebrate National Day, they will look back on these times and say yes, this generation stood together, sacrificed for one another, and built Singapore for us.NS SquareEvery National Day, we remind ourselves that Singapore is a nation whose story is worth celebrating, whose history is worth cherishing, and whose future is worth building.When we hold the National Day Parade at the Padang, or at the Float@Marina Bay, the audience can see the Marina Bay skyline in the background. Marina Bay used to be open sea, but we reclaimed the land around it, turned the ocean into a reservoir, and progressively built on the new land, to create an outstanding and vibrant downtown. Looking out across the Bay, you can immediately see how far Singapore has come, and imagine the possibility and promise that Singapore holds.Today, when National Service recruits complete their Basic Military Training (BMT), they gather their families and friends at the Float and hold their passing out parade there. It helps them to understand what they are defending, and why generations of national servicemen have been willing to serve and sacrifice, to defend this metropolis that we have built together, and also the society that created all this: Our families. Our friends. Our lives. Our future.Three years ago, I announced that we would rebuild the Float into a permanent space to commemorate National Service, and the central role that NS plays in Singapore, and that we would name this space, NS Square. The design contract has been awarded. This is how it will look like. The development will be aligned on a central axis, with The Promontory on the opposite side of the Bay. The platform will become a red dot, shining bright in our city. NS Square will be the central focus of our new downtown. We will build a gallery there to showcase our National Service story, and honour the contributions of national servicemen past and present. NS Square will also be a community space for everyone, young and old, to enjoy. And of course, we will continue to hold our National Day Parades there.ConclusionThis National Day, as we celebrate across the island, we will be saying the Pledge and singing Majulah Singapura in unison – not aloud as usual because of COVID-19, but in our hearts, with more feeling than ever.We have dreams to realise, and goals to reach for. Let us show the world that whatever the challenges, Singaporeans will stay united, and prevail once more.I wish everyone a very happy National Day!', 'id': 'a16888db-d0c0-470e-a935-c85b5d0ee9c1', 'score': None, 'probability': None, 'question': None, 'meta': {'category': 'articles'}, 'embedding': None},\n",

Students who require digital devices or internet access are being assisted.Throughout the HBL, teachers and other school personnel continue to work from home or from school to support students. School staff will also keep in contact with them and their parents.SPED teachers will also continue to provide students and their parents with HBL support for the customised curriculum and maintain regular contact.Extension of Circuit Breaker Period till 1 June 2020With the Multi-Ministry Taskforce's decision to extend the Circuit Breaker (CB) period till 1 June 2020, the Ministry of Education (MOE) will bring forward the June holidays to 5 May 2020.With the school holidays brought forward, lessons will resume on 2 June 2020 (more details on the format of these lessons – physical classes, partial HBL or full HBL – will be released at a later date).Term 3 will now be longer, but there will be a one-week mid-term break from 20 to 26 July 2020. These adjustments will apply to all MOE Kindergartens, primary, secondary and Pre-University students, including students from Special Education (SPED) schools.The revised academic calendar is as follows: 5 May 2020 to 1 June 2020: School holidays 2 June 2020: Start of Term 3 20 July 2020 to 26 July 2020: Mid-term break 6 September 2020: End of Term The IHLs will take the following approach from 5 May 2020 to 1 June 2020: Students from polytechnics will continue with full HBL Students from the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) will continue with full HBL until 8 May 2020. Thereafter, they will be on vacation from 9 May to 1 June. (The vacation is brought forward from mid-June. ITE will be providing more details separately.) Students from the Singapore Institute of Technology and some students from the Singapore University of Technology and Design will be starting their school term on 18 May 2020 in full HBL The other Autonomous Universities will be having their holidays. Those offering a summer term will conduct all classes online. For those with are unable to secure alternative childcare arrangements during this timeParents are strongly encouraged to keep their children at home during this period. Parents working in essential services like healthcare and who are also unable to secure alternative care arrangements, may continue to approach their children's primary school, MOE Kindergarten or SPED school for assistance during this time and during the school holidays. These support services have been ongoing throughout the HBL period, and will continue to be offered. Private education institutions should either continue with their HBL arrangements, or suspend classes otherwise.Examinations during this time Cancelled: All school-based mid-year examinations The GCE-Level Mid-Year Mother Tongue Language (MTL) Written Examinations will be rescheduled as follows: Subject examined Original date Rescheduled date O-Level MTL (Papers 1 and 2) A-Level H1 MTL (Papers 1 and 2) 1 June 2020 8 am 18 June 2020 2 pm O-Level MTL B (Papers 1 and 2) A-Level MTL B (Papers 1 and 2) 2 June 2020 8 am 19 June 2020 2:30 pm The listening comprehension for O- and A-level MTL and MTL B will be rescheduled as follows: Subject Examined Original date Rescheduled date O-Level MTL andMTL B Listening Comprehension 21 Jul 2020 27 Jul 2020 A-Level MTL and MTL B Listening Comprehension 22 Jul 2020 27 Jul 2020 Removal of Common Last Topics (CLT)The CLT is a set of topics from a syllabus identified by MOE that would be taught last by all schools towards the end of the academic year. Itprovides MOE and SEAB with the flexibility of reducing the scope covered in national examinations should an unforeseen situation occur that does not allow schools to complete their teaching for the graduating cohorts.In light of the extendeed CB period, the CLT will be removed from the national examinations this year.The CLT will still be taught, but not be examinable.For skill-based subjects such as English Language and MTL, it will not be meaningful and practical to identify CLTs. In such instances, SEAB will take the disruption to curriculum time into consideration during marking and grading to ensure that all students are fairly assessed.====Qn: Can students still come back to school premises during this time? Students are therefore strongly advised to stay at home and avoid going out unnecessarily, unless they have been identified for the limited service arrangements or to use the school computers for HBL, which allow them to be in school during the HBL days. Schools and IHLs will be in touch with their students on the necessary arrangements. Qn: Is the SLS equipped to accommodate all students under full HBL? During the national one-day Home-Based Learning (HBL), while most students and teachers were able to access Student Learning Space (SLS) for their lessons, some experienced intermittent availability of the system on the morning of the first day for primary schools, especially between 8.00am and 9.50am. MOE resolved the issue through a series of technical measures to better manage the increased user numbers. There was a smoother experience on the second and third days of HBL for the secondary schools and JC/CI.MOE has also advised schools on practices that they can adopt to ensure a smooth experience for all SLS users, such as encouraging students to adhere to their allocated log in times to the SLS system to complete their online assignments. MOE will also ensure that the system remains accessible to users throughout the full HL period.In addition to SLS, schools employ different online tools and resources for lessons, or assign learning through offline modes, such as issuing assignments to students using textbooks and workbooks.Qn: I have three children and do not have enough devices at home for their Home-Based Learning (HBL). What should I do?HBL involves both online and offline approaches to learning. Therefore, not all HBL will require the use of devices and your children can take turns to use the device.If the HBL plan issued by the school requires the use of a computer/device and your child is not equipped with one, do approach your child's school for assistance. All schools are equipped with sufficient devices to loan out to students for online HBL. Schools can also assist if the child does not have access to the internet at home.Qn: If we have to go through a prolonged period of Home-Based Learning (HBL), what will happen to exams?For school-based examinations, schools will review and adjust their plans to ensure continuity of teaching, learning and assessment through HBL.For national examinations, MOE recognises these are major milestones and will ensure that these examinations will proceed as far as possible so that graduating students are not disadvantaged. MOE/SEAB will take various measures to lessen the impact of prolonged HBL on students. For example, if curriculum time cannot be fully recovered, MOE will consider removing certain topics from the examinations (both for school-based and for national examinations) and the mark scheme will take this into account. When awarding grades, MOE will also take into consideration the exceptional circumstances to ensure that no students are disadvantaged. As of now, national examinations will proceed with no adjustments necessary.

       " {'text': \"standing by her patients and an olympic dream For many, the COVID-19 pandemic was a time to put plans on hold – but not for 29-year-old Joan Poh.Joan, who is part of Singapore’s national rowing team, continued her pursuit of her Olympic dream, while at the same time, taking a step further to join healthcare workers at the frontline. Gunning for the Olympics When COVID-19 struck, Joan was training in Melbourne. Her sights were set on the qualification race in April 2020 that would qualify Singapore for rowing in the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. At this point, she had been on no-pay leave from Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) for more than a year, to focus on full-time training. But when it was announced that the Tokyo 2020 Olympics were to be postponed due to the COVID-19 situation, it took some time for the news to sink in for Joan. Her dreams of being the second Singaporean rower to qualify for the Olympics would have to be put on hold. Naturally, she was frustrated. “I did put aside all my other life plans and goals, to chase the Olympic dreams for the past three years… And finally, come 2020, I suddenly couldn't see the finish line”While she had much to be upset about, she did not wallow in self-pity. Instead, when she saw that the healthcare industry needed all the manpower it could get, she made the decision to return to nursing, at TTSH.She felt it was the right thing for her to do, even though her goal so far had been solely focused on training for the Olympics. “I felt like I needed to do something, something more. I felt like it was a time for me to put on my uniform and go back to work,” she explains.Pouring her heart into nursing As a staff nurse in TTSH’s renal unit, Joan’s job is to assist dialysis patients. But she sees her job as more than simply treating patients. “I personally like to see the patient as a person with a dream and aspiration, like myself. And being able to speak up for their best interest is something that really draws me in, to learn about them as a person,” she tells us.Joan feels strongly that nurses hold an important collaborative role, in acting as the advocate for the patient, especially when the patient has to deal with medical professionals from various departments.As a nurse, she feels that she’s in a privileged position to make a difference, simply by listening to patients. “We see a lot of patients, right? But patients only see a few nurses or doctors. We are going to be how they remember their experience in the hospital.” she muses.Keeping the dream alive Even as she’s back in her scrubs, helping patients, it has not been an easy road juggling both training and nursing. When she was training full-time, she had the luxury of planning her training time and setting aside time for recovery. Now, she can no longer do that, as the better part of her day is taken up by work. “I try to wake up earlier in the morning to put in one (training) session. Then after work, I'll put in another session,” she tells us. It does take a toll on her. Her best friend, Qihui Ng, 35, notes how Joan is so tired at times it’s hard for her to stay awake even at gatherings with friends. But despite her grueling routine, Joan has taken things one step further, even finding the time to mentor her juniors in the sport. Sherdyn Teng, 25, who has benefitted from Joan’s guidance, is appreciative, as “not many elite athletes, with their busy schedules, are willing to go the extra mile of guiding juniors, but Joan does it, even while juggling her nursing job”. “I still want to know whether I'm Olympic material” Joan still has a firm vision to pursue her Olympic dream, and says she’ll keep going till she sees it come to fruition.Her journey was made possible by the people around her. Joan shares that the people who stood by her – family, close friends, and partner - were those who believed in her, even when they did not understand what she was doing. Her organisation, TTSH, played a big part too, allowing her to go on no-pay leave for a whole year. “I wasn't a winning athlete, all I had was a dream. And they saw value in it,” she says. With that, she’ll continue pushing forward as a rower, and the people around her have complete faith in her pursuit. Qihui points out, “Both representing Singapore in rowing, and being a nurse requires hard work and ‘heart’ work.“Joan has both.” The article is part of a series of stories of individuals who have showed support to fellow Singaporeans during this fight against COVID-19.\", 'id': '4415ce4b-754f-45fb-b905-7efe89b1b6a4', 'score': None, 'probability': None, 'question': None, 'meta': {'category': 'articles'}, 'embedding': None},\n",
       " {'text': 're opening safely in phase 2 [Updated as of 29 Aug 2020]Singapore entered Phase 2 of our gradual re-opening on 19 June 2020.As more activities resume, the number of COVID-19 cases in the community is expected to rise. To enable our economy and society to re-open safely in Phase 2 and beyond, the Government will expand our COVID-19 testing strategy, and further encourage digital tools that support contact tracing.Expansion of testing strategyCurrently, Singapore’s testing strategy is focused on active case finding among the community, and active surveillance testing amongst the more vulnerable groups. The Ministry of Health (MOH) plans to increase our testing capacity to 40,000 tests per day.First, MOH has stepped up testing of close contacts. Where MOH would previously only quarantine close contacts of confirmed cases, they now will test all of them before the start of their quarantine. This broadens the list of suspect cases, and allows MOH to isolate them early, preventing the virus from spreading further.Second, MOH has conducted comprehensive surveillance testing onall individuals above the age of 12 diagnosed with acute respiratory infection (ARI). This has allowed MOH to detect infected individuals early, as there is clinical and scientific evidence that a person is most infectious right before and immediately after the start of symptoms.If you are have respiratory symptoms, please see a doctor immediately so that you can be tested. All COVID-19 tests ordered by doctors at polyclinics at Public Health Preparedness Clinics (PHPC) are fully subsidised.Third, MOH will continue to conduct more active surveillance testing in the community. MOH will set up more Regional Screening Centres (RSC) to bring testing services closer to the community. Individuals with ARI, as well as those who require regular routine testing due to their work in higher risk sectors, will be able to get tested conveniently.Fourth, MOH will progressively reach out to identified community groups to offer COVID-19 testing on a one-time basis (from 29 Aug). For a start, MOH have plans to provide testing to community groups such as taxi and Private Hire Car (PHC) drivers, food delivery personnel, key vendors servicing foreign worker dormtories, as well as stallholders at F&B establishments. While there has been no local evidence that these community groups are of a higher risk of being infected, tests will be offered given the nature of their working environment, such as the high frequency of interactions with members of public. The costs of the tests for these identified groups will be fully borne by the government.Digital tools to strengthen contact tracingTechnology is another key enabler to allow us to open our economy and society confidently. Digital tools – such as SafeEntry and TraceTogether – help to complement manual contract tracing process, by speeding up the contact tracing process and improving its accuracy.SafeEntry – all businesses and services that are in operation are required to use this – it helps fill in a patient’s activity map quickly, so that contact tracers do not start on a blank slate. The records also help patients jog their memory, hence speeding up the time needed for activity mapping.TraceTogether works in tandem, by providing contact tracers proximity data, so that they can quickly identify people who have been in close contact with the patient.With more activities resuming in Phase 2, it is critical that everyone uses TraceTogether. There are currently 2 million uses of the TraceTogether app in Singapore. For those who do not have the requisite smartphones for the app the work properly, the Government will be providing TraceTogether Tokens from end-June, starting with elderly and progressively to the rest of the population.It’s a collective effort – play your partEven while expand our testing strategy and improve contact tracing efforts, it is important that everyone plays their part in our country’s safe re-opening.Remember – you are the first line of defence.Continue to practise strict safe distancing and maintain good personal hygiene, so that we can reduce the risk of transmissions in the community.With our collective efforts as a society, we can re-open safely and gradually resume more activities.', 'id': 'd2ceb202-9899-43f1-baa5-5023d7489ba5', 'score': None, 'probability': None, 'question': None, 'meta': {'category': 'articles'}, 'embedding': None},\n",
       " {'text': '5 ways to eat more sustainably Did you know that our dietary choices may not only affect our health but also have significant consequences for our environment?Here are 5 simple ways to be more mindful about what you consume:1. Opt for more greens, less meatRearing and transporting livestock requires large amounts of food, water, land and energy – which takes a toll on the environment.Reducing the amount of meat you eat and replacing it with plant-based proteins can significantly reduce land-use, water-use and harmful emissions. For instance, reducing 25% of red meat consumption in Singapore may help lower annual greenhouse gas emissions per capita by 8%, according to a 2019 study conducted by A*Star and Deloitte. This would in turn help limit global warming and reduce the number of people being exposed to climate-related risks such as extreme weather events.For a start, consider replacing one meat dish with vegetables or tofu every day.2. Avoid highly processed foodsProcessed foods have a higher carbon footprint as they are made with different ingredients from all parts of the world – each requiring multiple steps of traveling, manufacturing, and distribution.Most processed foods are also unhealthy. Avoiding food in this category will help eliminate waste, reduce energy-use in the food production process, and help individuals stay healthy.Avoid highly processed snacks such as potato chips, cup noodles or chocolate bars when you are hungry. Instead, opt for a handful of nuts or fresh fruit.3. Choose whole-grainsNon-refined carbohydrates are generally less resource-intensive to produce than refined ones as they require fewer processing steps.They are also good for your health, and reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease, Type 2 diabetes and being overweight.Opt for whole-meal bread, whole-grain pasta, unrefined barley, buckwheat products or quinoa as a source of daily carbohydrates. Whole-grains may be an acquired taste, but you can try mixing them with other ingredients to add interesting textures to your dishes. For instance, adding whole-grain cereals to your yogurt, or preparing a sandwich with slices of white bread and whole-meal bread.4. Reduce food packagingFood packaging, especially when made of non-recyclable materials (e.g. plastic, Styrofoam), can be extremely harmful to the environment. This is because the process of creating such materials use a lot of resources such as energy, water, chemicals, petroleum and fibers. The manufacturing process also generates harmful emissions and wastewater containing toxic contaminants.Non-recyclable food packing often take many years to decompose, leading to the accumulation of waste in landfills or oceans. Chemicals from the packaging materials, including ink and dyes, may also leach into groundwater and soil, posing a harmful threat to our ecosystem.To reduce pollution, choose fruits and vegetables (e.g. bananas, potatoes) that require minimal packaging, or reduce the amount of food packaging by placing more items in a single bag.Bring your own reusable bags/containers wherever possible, or opt for packaging that is biodegradable, reusable, or made from recycled materials.5. Limit your number of grocery tripsWhile heading out to your favourite mall or grocery store may not be as harmful as you think, limiting the number of trips you make, or buying from locations near you is a quick and easy way to reduce your carbon footprint.Try walking to your nearest supermarket for your groceries next time - it can be a fun way for you and your family to keep fit. If that’s not possible, try cycling or using public transport – it increases fuel efficiency and reduces pollution.For more ways to reduce your carbon footprint: How to Reduce, Reuse and Recycle (in that order)', 'id': 'dde76203-5fd8-4dc8-9155-2d3ba2452fcd', 'score': None, 'probability': None, 'question': None, 'meta': {'category': 'articles'}, 'embedding': None},\n",
       " {'text': \"how to practise the 3rs Reduce, reuse, recycle.We've all heard this refrain many times. However, did you know that the 3Rs of waste management are listed in order of priority?Reducing waste is the best option, with reusing products coming next. If the first 2 Rs are not possible, then recycle.Reduce – the best of the 3Rs. The most effective way to manage waste is to not create it. Whether at home, at work or outside, be mindful of the ways that you can reduce consumption of water, electricity, plastic and paper. Here are some simple ways you can get started: Water Turn off the tap when it’s not in use, e.g. while brushing teeth, or washing hands Avoid long showers; keep them to no more than 15 minutes Electricity Turn off lights and fans when they are not in use If possible, set the air-conditioner temperature at about 25°C Opt for energy-efficient appliances with either “very good” or “excellent” ratings Plastic Reduce the use of disposable cutlery by eating in, or invest in reusable sets Choose items that have less packaging Paper Use both sides of a piece of paper Reduce the letters you receive by opting for email alerts, or removing your name from mailing lists that you no longer wish to receive mail from Reuse – the second best R. If you are thinking of throwing away an old item, stop first and consider ways you could reuse it. Reusing or repurposing items gives them a new lease of life, and prevents unnecessary wastage. You've just finished your soda, and are thinking of throwing the empty plastic bottle away. While recycling is a good option, why not give the old plastic bottle a new lease of life as a watering can for your plants? Some other creative ways you can reuse old items: Old clothes could be re-sewn into bags, or reused as cleaning rags Old jars and pots as storage items, e.g. mason jars for food canning Invest in reusable items, e.g. a tote bag instead of plastic bags for your groceries Recycle – the last stage of the waste hierarchy is to recycle what you have used. While 60% of Singaporean households recycle regularly, according to a household recycling study in 2019, a significant proportion of respondents are mistaken about what items can be recycled. For example, 67% thought that soiled paper food packaging is recyclable, and 49% believed that tissue paper can be recycled.However, both soiled food packaging and tissue paper have come into contact with contaminants like food waste and grease. A lot of tissue paper is also made from previously recycled paper – the fibres are too short and cannot be recycled. Thus, both items are not suitable for recycling and should be disposed of as general waste. When recycling, remember to: Drop off electronic waste (e.g. old mobile phones, IT accessories) at these designated collection points Check what can be recycled by following the labels on recycling bins. Recyclable items include paper, metal, plastic and glass items. Make sure that the recyclables are not contaminated with food or liquids. Rinse containers before recycling. Do not put clothes, shoes and bags in the recycling bins – donate them if in good condition The Singapore Green Plan 2030 aims to advance Singapore’s national agenda on sustainable development.

Try to plan your journeys around off-peak periods instead, where there may be fewer commuters. Sit and stay apart from one another, if possible. Safe Distancing while queuing Try to keep to safe distances while waiting for the bus or train. Stand at least 1m apart from one another and do not rush when boarding. Keep your mask on Masks have to be worn at all times the moment you leave your home, and that includes throughout your journey on public transport. Try not to speak One way COVID-19 spreads is through droplets when we sneeze, cough and speak. Try not to talk on public transport (even if it’s on the phone). Practise good hygiene Wash your hands with soap and water as soon as you can (especially after touching common surfaces), or use hand sanitiser if washing facilities are not available.

       " {'text': 'tweaks to health and urban policies needed in new covid 19 normal say experts Read 3 articles daily and stand to win ST rewards, including the ST News Tablet worth $398. Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - A Singapore of the not-so-distant future, where Covid-19 is endemic and herd immunity has been achieved through vaccination, will require adjustments in terms of health and urban policies, said experts. Life for most people here will move to a new normal, where \"vaccine passports\" may be required not just for travel, but also to take part in daily activities. Dr Woo Jun Jie from the Institute of Policy Studies at the National University of Singapore, who researches urban policy, said that once herd immunity is reached, a review of how closely packed Singapore is could be in order. \"There may be a need to reconsider Singapore\\'s urban density, as well as to ensure that sufficient space is allocated for safe distancing, should another pandemic occur again,\" he said. Besides this, there will be a need to continue building up capacity to adapt, especially in the country\\'s healthcare systems and urban settings. Dr Woo noted that Covid-19 has shown how important it is to be able to convert existing facilities, such as exhibition halls, into community care facilities. He noted that both the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in 2003 and the Covid-19 pandemic now have uncovered the need to maintain excess healthcare capacity - such as that provided by the isolation wards at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) - in readiness for future pandemics. NCID, a 330-bed purpose-built facility designed to boost Singapore\\'s capabilities in infectious disease management and prevention, was officially opened on Sept 7, 2019 - a mere few months before Covid-19 struck. Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat touched on similar themes at the World Cities Summit earlier this week. In response to a question on what strategies cities could adopt to hasten their recovery after a disruption, he said investing in the future and ensuring trust in authoritative sources of information were some of them. The Covid-19 pandemic has emphasised the need to be resilient to future pandemics, which are bound to occur again at some point, he said. Professor Ooi Eng Eong, an expert on emerging infectious diseases at Duke-NUS Medical School, said that in the immediate future, disease control measures will have to be finessed to balance the cost of using vaccines and Covid-19 treatments with their benefits to the population at large. A year and a half after the pandemic broke out, Singaporeans can begin thinking about life with Covid-19 as a part of it. On Thursday, the three ministers in charge of the task force tackling Covid-19 said the Government is drawing up a road map to allow people to work, shop and travel, without large-scale quarantine and lockdowns, even with the coronavirus in their midst. This will be done in tandem with achieving certain vaccination milestones. Singapore Management University law don Eugene Tan said that any changes to policy will be based on scientific evidence. For instance, testing may be required of unvaccinated individuals prior to their attending a mass event such as a concert, but not of vaccinated individuals, he said. Another possibility is the use of vaccine passports not only for travel, but also in daily life. Dr Ling Li Min, an infectious diseases physician from Rophi Clinic, said different parts of the world are already doing this. In Israel, for instance, some matchmaking agencies require a person\\'s vaccination status, and people cannot be matched if they have not been jabbed, she noted. \"Over the next year or so, as the world prepares to jab itself out of Covid-19 (restrictions), and with gradual reopening, pre-event testing and vaccination status would likely be the norm,\" she said. \"Whether we like it or not, vaccination and testing will be part of our lives.\" Join ST\\'s Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - Residents from a block of flats in Tiong Bahru trickled slowly into a pavilion for mandatory Covid-19 swab tests on Saturday morning (June 26). This comes after 13 residents from three households at Block 66 Eng Watt Street tested positive for the coronavirus, with the Health Ministry hoping to disrupt any wider, undetected community transmission. Ms Janine Stein, 59, a publisher in the entertainment industry, was among the first to get swabbed when testing operations began at 9am. She had found out about the mandatory swabbing the previous evening, from the notices put up around the block. \"I was really worried because this was my first time taking a swab. I spoke to some friends who said it was really painful, soreand uncomfortable, but actually it was okay. I could feel it, but it wasn\\'t painful at all,\" said Ms Stein, who is fully vaccinated against Covid-19. One of her nostrils was blocked and the swabber had to try again, she said, adding that the swab took about 20 seconds in total. Ms Stein said she was worried after hearing about the cases in her block, especially since it is not clear how the cases could be linked or how transmission had occurred. She said she purchased an antigen rapid test self-test kit from a Guardian outlet on Saturday morning to have peace of mind, in case she met other people. The test result was negative. \"The staff at the pavilion said it is not a quarantine and I can carry on (with normal activities), but I think it\\'s more responsible if I do the rapid test,\" she said. Ms Stein said she is currently working from home but will be limiting her movements. She usually visits the nearby Tiong Bahru market every few days but decided not to go on Saturday afternoon. \"Until we see where these cases go, I\\'m really limiting my movements. It\\'s not worth taking the risk,\" she said. Madam Adeline Tan, 47, a sales manager, headed to the pavilion for testing with her eight-year-old daughter and her domestic helper at around 10am. All three completed their swabs within 15 minutes. Her husband, who was at home caring for their five-year-old son, took the swab later. Madam Tan said there was no queue, possibly due to the rain, which began at around 9.45am. \"My daughter had a little bit of discomfort but it was manageable. I also felt it was okay,\" said Madam Tan, who has taken one dose of the vaccine and will be taking her second next Monday. She said she was not particularly worried about the cases in her blockand will continue to do her grocery shopping in the area. \"I just keep ensuring personal hygiene, I seldom go out, and my kids are always at home during this period. Additionally, this block is a walk-up so there are no lifts, and so no contact from enclosed areas,\" she added. Madam Tan said after the result of the swabs are out, she will inform her daughter\\'s primary school that she is staying in a block with confirmed Covid-19 cases, just to keep them in the loop. \"She is now still on home-based learning till July 6, so if nothing goes wrong and the result is negative, she will go back to school then,\" said Madam Tan. She will keep her younger son at home from pre-school for a day on Monday, as a precaution. The mandatory testing for all residents at Block 66 Eng Watt Street is conducted at the pavilion at 2D Boon Tiong Road on Saturday and Sunday, from 9am to 4pm.

Mr Anwar said when they were notified of the weekend distribution on Friday night, they immediately began printing posters and at about 11pm, went to all the blocks of flats to put the posters up at lift lobbies. Mr Goh Chin Hock, 58, a resident at Block 119 Bukit Merah View, collected his free self-test kit at around 2.30pm. Speaking in Mandarin, Mr Goh said: \"I might use it over the next few days, if I am unwell or want to feel less worried.\" He added he had previously tested negative when MOH conducted mandatory testing for residents in his block. Madam Tan Ah Chuam, 66, who lives at Block 117, said her colleagues had told her about the free kit collection. She collected a box for herself at the Bukit Merah View Zone B RC at around 3.30pm. Madam Tan, who works as a cleaner at the National Kidney Foundation dialysis centre at Block 128 Bukit Merah View, said she lives near the market and food centre so she is quite scared and avoids the area. She said: \"Previously I would go to the food centre to buy noodles or kueh, but now I don\\'t dare go near the area.\" Join ST\\'s Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - Guidelines for visits to Changi General Hospital (CGH) remain unchanged for most patients after some hospital staff tested positive for Covid-19. Patients in general wards are still able to receive one visitor at a time, with a cap ofone visit per person a day. Only the patients who are close contacts of those who tested positive have been placed in isolation, said CGH in an update on Facebook on Sunday (June 27). CGH posted the update after an article on Mothership.sg incorrectly said the visiting guidelines had changed after the positive tests. \"CGH is aware of a post by Mothership.sg stating that no visitors are allowed into our inpatient wards after Covid-19 cases among staff,\" it said in the Facebook post. \"This is not accurate.\" CGH also said outpatient appointments are continuing. The article by Mothership.sg, dated June 27, 11.08am, now carries an editor\\'s note which says:\"A previous version of this article\\'s headline said that visitors would not be allowed into CGH\\'s inpatient wards. \"We have since corrected the headline to reflect that only visitors of patients who are isolated after being identified as contacts of Covid-19 cases will not be allowed. We have also updated the article with further clarification on CGH\\'s visitation guideline,\" it said. This comes after three more hospital workers at CGH were reported to have tested positive for the Covid-19 virus by the Ministry of Health (MOH) on Saturday. They are a 21-year-old nurse and two porters. The nurse\\'s infection has been classified as an unlinked case, while the porters, aged 48 and 66, have had their infections linked to the cluster at the hospital. There are now five cases in the cluster. The other cases in the cluster are also hospital porters, with the first patient, a 35-year-old man, having tested positive on June 22. In a separate post on Facebook on Saturday night, CGH said its infection control protocols have been activated since the positive tests. \"Contact tracing and ongoing surveillance swab tests are in progress, and focused enhanced surveillance swabs have been conducted for relevant staff in CGH,\" it said. \"Staff who have been in close contact have been placed on quarantine orders or on leave of absence pending further investigations.\" CGH also said it was conducting more swab tests for patients in the hospital and was stepping up its monitoring of patients who develop fevers or symptoms of respiratory infection.

Of these, 15 were community cases - five of which are currently unlinked. There were no cases from migrant workers\\' dormitories, and three imported cases who had been placed on stay-home notice on arrival in Singapore, said the Ministry of Health (MOH). More details will be announced on Tuesday night. On Monday night, MOH said a 44-year-old man died of complications from Covid-19 infection on Sunday. This brings Singapore\\'s death toll from the coronavirus to 35. The man was admitted to Alexandra Hospital on May 25 and was confirmed to have the Covid-19 infection the next day. He had not been vaccinated against Covid-19, and had a history of diabetes,said MOH. Alexandra Hospital has contacted his family and is extending assistance to them, added the ministry. MOH saidthat special testing operations will be conducted for all staff at the FairPrice supermarket at 166 Bukit Merah Central. This is to disrupt any undetected community transmission after cases of Covid-19 infection were found among people who had visited the supermarket. \"We will also extend free Covid-19 testing to members of the public who had visited FairPrice at 166 Bukit Merah Central between June 3 and 21,\" said MOH. Five more people were added to the Bukit Merah View Market and Food Centre cluster, said MOH on Monday night. This brings the total number of cases in the cluster to 78. There were no new cases from workers\\' dormitories, marking a week since the last dormitory case was confirmed on June 14. The weekly total number of community cases was 103 in the past week, up from 49 in the previous week.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. The latest coronavirus variant to raise concern, Delta Plus, has not been detected in Singapore, said director of medical services Kenneth Mak yesterday. He said the Covid-19 task force will continue to keep a lookout and monitor the situation here. Delta Plus is the Delta variant of the coronavirus with an additional mutation in a particular spike protein K417N. The first case was detected in India in April, and cases have since been found in other countries including the United States, Britain, Japan, Portugal and Nepal. Delta Plus has been labelled as a variant of concern by the Indian government after evidence suggested that it is more transmissible, with the virus binding more strongly to lung cells and being potentially resistant to treatment and vaccines as well as immunity from previous Covid-19 infection. Speaking at a press conference by the multi-ministry task force on Covid-19, Associate Professor Mak said there have been two versions of Delta Plus - the AY1 version that has been reported mainly in Europe, and the AY2 version that has been reported in various places including the US. \"For every case that we diagnose, where possible, we will be carrying out phylogenetic studies and (we will) look out for the specific variant causing these infections, and we will certainly be on the lookout for any Delta Plus variant as it has been reported,\" he added in response to a question raised by The Straits Times on whether the variant has been spotted in Singapore. Phylogenetics studies the evolutionary relationship between species. The World Health Organisation characterises the variant of Sars-CoV-2, which causes Covid-19, as a variant of interest if it has been identified to cause community transmission or multiple cases, or has been detected in multiple countries. A variant of concern is one that shows evidence of higher transmissibility and virulence, leading to more severe disease that requires hospitalisation and causes deaths. For every case that we diagnose, where possible, we will be carrying out phylogenetic studies and (we will) look out for the specific variant causing these infections, and we will certainly be on the lookout for any Delta Plus variant as it has been reported.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - Great Eastern Life Assurance will be providing free Covid-19 protection coverage for all Singapore residents. Known as the GREAT Covid Care Plan, the post-vaccination protection plan will provide a cash payout of $200 per day of hospitalisation, up to a total of $2,000, should one get hospitalised due to Covid-19 after their vaccination. The plan covershospitalisation in Singapore and overseas. The company said in a statement on Saturday (June 26) this would help Singaporeans who may travel abroad for work or leisure, and for overseas residents returning to their home country for visits. The company said a Singapore resident refers to any Singaporean or Singapore Permanent Resident or with a valid employment pass (EP holders / S Pass holders / work permit) or student\\'s pass or dependant\\'s pass,and residing in Singapore. Residents must complete their first dose by Dec 31 to qualify for the coverage. The vaccine must be approved for use by the Health Sciences Authority or supplied under the Special Access Route. The coverage also extends to children who have been vaccinated. Parents may register on behalf of their children who are under 18. The plan will provide coverage for 12 months from the date of registration, or from the date of their first dose of the vaccine, whichever is later. Residents have to register at Great Eastern\\'s website by Sept 30 to activate the free coverage. Great Eastern Group chief executive Khor Hock Seng, said: \"With the steady progress of the vaccination programme in Singapore, the country is well positioned for recovery in this new phase. \"Many in Singapore have done their part to be vaccinated and as we adapt to an environment where Covid-19 is likely to remain endemic for at least a period of time, we want to continue to do our part to protect our community in Singapore and even when they travel overseas.\" For more information, visitthiswebsite.

       " {'text': 'perks for those who get jabs may nudge the undecided Read 3 articles daily and stand to win ST rewards, including the ST News Tablet worth $398. Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - As Singapore accelerates its vaccination drive, more perks are being dangled for people who get vaccinated, a move that could persuade the undecided to take the jab. The lure of easier travel, for instance, was a factor in spurring Ms Eliza Xue to change her mind about not getting shots for herself and her children, aged 17 and 19. The housewife, 53, accompanies her husband when he travels to Malaysia once every two to three months for business. \"Initially, I wanted to wait as I read and heard about some people having side effects. It wasn\\'t an easy decision,\" she told Insight. There could be more people thinking the same way soon, with the multi-ministry task force on Covid-19 announcing on Thursday that travel concessions will be given to fully vaccinated travellers going overseas or returning to Singapore. While details have yet to be fully ironed out, the task force did provide some examples of such perks, such as overseas travel allowed without stay-home notice, as well as non-travel-related ones like vaccinated people being allowed to gather in larger groups. Companies like Shake Shack are also getting in on the action to support the vaccination campaign. The restaurant will offer vaccinated customers free fries with every burger purchase from July 1 to 15. But experts are ambivalent about too many incentives being dished out, given how there are still many in the queue who want to be vaccinated but have yet to reach their turn. Associate Professor Alex Cook, vice-dean of research at the National University of Singapore\\'s Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, said: \"It would be inequitable at this point to give many special privileges, but at some point, after we\\'ve offered everyone the vaccine, we should consider relaxing some measures preferentially. \"Perhaps mask-wearing might no longer be compulsory for those who have been vaccinated, or future quarantine rules might be less onerous,\" he said. Right now, those who are fully vaccinated are already exempt from pre-event testing for events like live performances and wedding solemnisations. But with much of the population yet to be vaccinated, other safe management measures can be expected to continue, said Assistant Professor Hannah Clapham, an epidemiologist and mathematical modeller at the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health. \"There will be a constant recalibration of how much of these other measures are needed as more and more people get vaccinated,\" she said. Incentives aside, Professor Dale Fisher, a senior infectious diseases consultant at the National University Hospital (NUH), noted that the biggest perk of vaccination should simply be that the person is less likely to get seriously ill or die of Covid-19. \"You are also less likely to infect those around you because you are less likely to get infected with even the mild form of the disease,\" he said. Prof Fisher strongly discouraged travelling without being vaccinated, saying it is risky to be sick in a foreign country where one is unsure about the healthcare standards or costs of treatment. Some vaccinated people Insight spoke to said they felt more assured of their health after receiving their shots. A 23-year-old public servant who wanted to be known only as Ms Tan described vaccination as the stepping stone allowing her to resume all the fun activities she loves. \"I really miss travelling and just being able to hang out with my friends without worrying so much about the restrictions,\" she said, adding that the long-drawn pandemic has taken a toll on everyone\\'s mental health. Ms Tan, who will receive her second jab late next month, hopes to volunteer for the #igotmyshot campaign, and be involved in opportunities such as going to homes to encourage senior citizens to get vaccinated and assist them with the sign-up process. High vaccination rates remain the long-term and sustainable solution for Singapore, experts also said. Vaccination will reduce the strain on the healthcare system, given that those who have received the shots will likely suffer only a milder form of the disease and resources can be directed to support the few who will suffer from severe complications, said Professor Teo Yik Ying, dean of the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health. He noted that when Covid-19 eventually becomes endemic, hospital use due to Covid-19 complications will be monitored over daily case counts. The need for contact tracing operations will also no longer be necessary. \"But for that to happen, the vaccines used must be safe and efficacious, robust against new emerging variants, and Singapore needs to continue having a steady and reliable supply in the likely event of booster shots being a necessity.\" So far, Singapore\\'s vaccination drive has made good progress, with over 50 per cent of the local population having received at least a dose, and some 80,000 vaccine doses to be administered daily from today. But not everyone remains convinced that a vaccine is effective. Ms Xue added that she had been banned from a group of parents opposing vaccinations for their children on messaging platform Telegram. Some of them appeared to subscribe to the belief that vaccinated people would have magnets embedded inside them and would face death after three to five years, she said. She was banned from the group for suggesting that masks and circuit breakers were necessary. Experts have attributed possible reasons to vaccine hesitancy - such as a desire to wait before trying something new, a lack of a sense of urgency to be vaccinated, as well as a preference by some for non-mRNA vaccines like Sinovac\\'s. Currently, the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, both of which use mRNA technology, are part of Singapore\\'s national vaccination campaign. Other approved vaccines under the Special Access Route include those by Sinovac, Johnson & Johnson, Oxford-AstraZeneca and Sinopharm, and are made available through the private healthcare sector.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - The 115 Bukit Merah View Market and Food Centre - which is at the centre of Singapore\\'s largest open Covid-19 cluster - reopened on Sunday (June 27) after a two-week closure. However, fewer than 10 stalls out of the 182 there were open for business when The Straits Times visited at 8.30am. Some stallholders returned to clean their stalls and clear existing stocks, after ending their quarantine on Saturday. Human traffic was also visibly thin, as some residents were told by hawkers that they were not operating yet. One of those stallholders who returned to work on Sunday was Ms Lindawati Tjong, 47, who has for nine years run a stall selling raw chicken with her husband. She said she was not too worried about the virus as her family members havemostly been vaccinated or are going to get the jab. Her family of five - including three children aged 11, 17 and 19 - were quarantined at home for the past two weeks. Their quarantine ended on Saturday. Asked why she reopened so soon, she told reporters: \"We have no choice - we have a family to feed and no income for the past two weeks.\" But she is more optimistic now that business can resume. Lawyer Ho Woon Chan, 51, who has been buying chicken from Ms Tjong every week for years, said he had observed behaviour that could pose risks of Covid-19 transmission at the market. He said he hadseen residents around the area spending hours smoking and drinking. Some didnot wear their masks properly, such as wearing them at the chin, he added. He takes measures to protect himself, such as not loitering after his shopping is done. \"I\\'ve started wearing masks since Chinese New Year last year,\" he added. As atSaturday, there were 89 cases linked to the cluster at the market and food centre. The earliest case among the cluster, which was declared on June 13, was found to have been infected on June 9. He is a Singaporean man, 74, who workedat a sundry store there. The market was initially closed from June 13 to 15 for deep cleaning. The closure was later extended to June 26, after nine more cases were linked to the cluster on June 15. Newspaper vendor Oh Seng Hock, 70, who has sold newspapers for close to 50 years next to the market, said that human traffic has dropped drastically in the past two weeks. \"There are flies around but not people,\" he told ST. \"There are more workers and reporters than customers.\" Madam Aw Yeow, 64, who runs a stall selling vegetables, was cleaning up her stall and clearing her old stock on Sunday. Her family was asked to quarantine for two weeks on June 12. She plans to resume business on Tuesday, when new stock arrives. Other than the market, Covid-19 clusters in the vicinity include one at 119 Bukit Merah View (eight cases); one at 121 Bukit Merah View (five cases); and another at 90 Redhill Close (four cases). Tanjong Pagar GRC MP Joan Pereira, who was at the market speaking with residents and stallholders, said that there has been an \"outpouring of love, care and support\" for the hawkers and stallholders over the past two weeks. \"They\\'ve also shared with methat they are assured that we will be helping them to apply for the grant they are eligible for, because that would really help them financially.\" She said the town council will continue to deep clean anddisinfectcommon spaces and high-touch surfaces like lift buttons and railings. \"NEA also shared with me that they will facilitate the routine testing of our hawkers every 14 days,\" she told reporters, referring to the National Environment Agency. \"Our hawkers do expect that people will be more cautious about coming back to dine in, and people might prefer to do takeaway or online delivery,\" she said, adding that an online delivery platform has agreed to offer free delivery for those that order food from the hawker centre. Preparations made for the reopening at 115 Bukit Merah View Market and Food Centre include pasting additional queue markings on the floor in front of stalls to encourage safe distancing. An NEAspokesman told ST on Saturday that the agency has worked with Tanjong Pagar Town Council to mark seats and tables at the dining areas of the hawker centre in line with prevailing regulations. This was meant to facilitate dine-in by no more than two people in a group and with at least 1m between groups. \"Enforcement will be stepped up against patrons who do not comply with safe management measures, safe distancing and wearing of masks,\" said thespokesman. The spokesman also said that patrons should scan the TraceTogether-only SafeEntry QR code at all shopfronts before making any purchases. \"Safe distancing personnel will proactively check that patrons have performed check-ins. Stallholders and stall assistants will be reminded to check in and out via the... QR code at their stalls,\" added the spokesman. Professor Paul Tambyah, professor of medicine at the National University of Singapore Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, told ST last week that the main concern about the Bukit Merah clusters was the large number of unvaccinated individuals who are still susceptible to the virus. \"Hopefully, that number will go down and we will not have any more clusters like these. \"While waiting for the vaccinations to be rolled out, the concern is that we still do not know the mode of transmission so are not able to take specific targeted preventative action,\" he said.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - All new travellers arriving from high-risk countries and regions will have theirstay-home notice (SHN) cut to 14 days,instead of 21 days, to be served at dedicated facilitiesfrom 11.59pm on Wednesday (June 23). However, they must take an antigen rapid test using self-test kits on the third, seventh and 11th day after arriving in Singapore. This new requirement will come into force at 11.59pm onJune 27. Travellers can collect the self-test kits when they reach the SHN facilities. The higher-risk places include all countries or regions except Australia, Brunei, Hong Kong, Macau, Chinaand New Zealand. Affected travellers who are now serving their SHN will have their notice reviewed and they will be informed of their check-out arrangements separately. TheMinistry of Health (MOH), in a statement on Wednesday, said that while there is increased transmissibility with the new variants of concern, it found no evidence - from both overseas and local data - that these variants come with longer incubation periods. It added that since the 21-day SHN for all travellers with recent travel history to higher-risk countries or regions was implemented from May 8, there were 270 imported cases among such travellers, as at Tuesday. MOH said: \"All of them had incubation periods well within the 14-day window. (Thus), we will reduce the SHN period from 21 days back to 14 days.\" However, to identify potential infection cases early and provide infected travellers with appropriate medical care as soon as possible, travellers will be required to test themselves regularly with antigen rapid test (ART) self-test kits on the third, seventh and 11th day of their arrival in Singapore, while serving their SHN. This is on top of the Covid-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests they have to take on arrival in Singapore, and on Day 14 of their arrival, before they finish their SHN. ART is a quick screening tool to detect the presence of the Sars-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19. It is able to pick up infections early and can be done in less than 20 minutes. PCR tests are done by taking swabs from the nose or back of the throat, or from sputum. These tests are the gold standardfor testing and look for genetic sequences of Covid-19. MOH on Wednesday also said travellers who were in Taiwan and Israel 21 days immediately before arriving in Singapore will be allowed to apply to opt out of dedicated SHN facilitiesand serve their 14-day SHN in their homes. However, they must not have travelled to any other country or region in the last 21 days and they must be living alone or only with household members who are also serving their SHNwith the same travel history and duration of SHN. Refund details are being worked out for travellers who are affected by these changes and they will be informed, MOH said. Newly arrived migrant workers from higher-risk countries or regions and who are living in dormitories or working in the construction, marine and process sectors will continue to go through an additional seven-day stay at the Migrant Worker Onboarding Centre or a dedicated facility after they are cleared from their 14-day SHN at dedicated SHN facilities. The additional seven-day stay has been in place since early this yearand it includes an additional testing regime, medical examination and a settling-in programme (SIP), where required. The Ministry of Manpower said on its website that the SIP is a one-day orientation programme to educate foreign workers on Singapore\\'s social norms, their employment rights and responsibilities, as well as Singapore\\'s laws and how they can seek assistance if needed. This precautionary measure will further minimise any small risk of imported Covid-19 positive cases transmitting the virus inthe dormitories or at the worksites which can result in large clusters, and will be regularly reviewed as the Covid-19 situation evolves. As at Tuesday, a new cluster of three cases has been linked to a foreign domestic worker who tested positive on June 14. New crew members from higher-risk countries or regions who are entering Singapore on a long-term permit to work on board harbour crafts or vesselsoperating in the Port of Singapore will undergo an additional seven-day stay and testing regime at a dedicated facility. This will be after they have cleared their 14-day SHN in Singaporeand before they commence work on board the vessel. This will serve as precaution in view of the essential marine services that the harbour craft provides to support the supply chain, said MOH.

The Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE) said on Friday (June 25) that the breaches also included not wearing masks when not doing strenuous exercises. The limit for social gatherings went up from two to five on June 14, following a fall in the number of Covid-19 cases in the community. But last weekend, a group of 17 people were caught at Changi Beach Park, and another group of 13 people were caught at East Coast Park. MSE said about 1,800 advisories havebeen issued for breaches. Orchard Hotel Singapore has also been issued a fine and a suspension order after Singapore Tourism Board enforcement officers found 11 people gathered in a room there for a birthday celebration on Feb 6, MSE said. At that time, no more than eight people were allowed to be together for social gatherings. The hotel was given a composition fine of $1,000, and was ordered to suspend room bookings for 30 daystill July 24. But it will be allowed to fulfil existing bookings made prior to the suspension. Investigations of the individuals found in the room are ongoing, and enforcement action may be taken against them. MSE also said all water play areas, water recreational facilities, campsites and barbecue pits in parks and gardens managed by the National Parks Board will remain closed until further notice. Some parks, sections of beaches, lawnsand facilities may also be temporarily closed when these areas get too crowded, or when people do not comply with safe management measures. MSE said enforcement action will be takenagainst any breachof safe management measures at these premises and identified hot spots based on public feedback and ground observations. “These include parks, beachesand common areas of Housing Board estates such as hardcourts, basketball courts and pavilions,” it added. MSE said agencies will continue to ramp up checks on food and beverage premises over the coming weekends. Operators who breach safe management measures face closures, even for first offences. Rumours Beach Club in Sentosa has hired a third-party security company to assist safe distancing ambassadors, even though the club’s revenues have dropped by about half. The general manager of the club, Mr Romy Sastranegara, said: “We serve alcohol, so sometimes it can get difficult for customers who have had a few drinks to comply with safe management measures, such as putting on masks when they move around. It is easier for our staff to serve customers if we have another team that focuses on enforcing safe management measures.” He also said it was important to encourage employees to get vaccinated, given that they interact with many unmasked customers daily. Almost 40 per cent of the staff have done so. Join ST's Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. SPH Digital News / Copyright © 2021 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd. Co.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - More than 340 food and beverage (F&B) outlets were fined for breaching Covid-19 safe management measures from the start of phase twoin June last year to the end of March this year. This included nightlife establishments that pivoted to F&B operations, said the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) on Saturday (June 26) in response to queries from The Straits Times. Over 100 F&B outlets were also suspended in the same period. ST followed officers from the SFA on an operation at five outlets in Jalan Leban and Thong Soon Avenue on Saturday evening - the first weekend since the ban on dining in to curb the spread of Covid-19 was lifted. Such operations ensure that safe management measures are followed at F&B establishments, such as having diners and staff wear their masks properly at all times except when eating or drinking, the SFA said. Other measures officers look out for include ensuring that patrons observe a safe distance of at least 1m in queues and between groups of diners, and that groups do not exceed the permitted size. \"We also ensure that there is no sale or consumption of alcohol after 10.30pm, or the provision of public entertainment,\" the SFA said. One business is being investigated for having two different groups of people seated at the same table, with only an acrylic divider between the groups. Reminders were also given at another establishment to ensure patrons sat 1m apart. SFA enforcement officer Aldric Ang, who has been conducting these checks since January, said: \"Usually the first thing we look out for is whether they are wearing masks properly. We also look out for the number of patrons seated together and if safe distancing is observed.\" Officers also check that safe management measures are adhered to by staff in the kitchen area. Sometimes food handlers might not wear their masks properly over their noses, Mr Ang noted. SFA officers do not hand out fines on the spot, but they will investigate the lapse and gather evidence such as taking down details of the individuals or F&B operators. The agency may also take a statement from them. Investigations generally wrap up within three months, but the timeframe varies depending on the complexity of the case, the SFA said. Safe distancing operation exercises are typically conducted during periods of higher human traffic or at timings known to have safe management non-compliance. Teams of around three to five officers are typically deployed to different areas during such exercises. In previous instances that saw F&B outlets fined, the SFA observed that common breaches included allowing groups larger than the permitted number to be seated together, seating customers less than 1m apart, and allowing intermingling of customers between tables.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - Temasek Foundation will be giving one oximeter to every household in Singapore so that residents can monitor their blood oxygen levels regularly. The device checks theoxygen level in the blood and can help detect early signs of a deterioration in health. This initiative comes as new and more infectious Covid-19 variants emerge.\"The Covid-19 virus can cause blood oxygen levels to drop to dangerously low levels, even when you have no other symptoms,\" the foundation said in a statement on Thursday (June 24). \"\\'Silent pneumonia\\' is one of the most serious consequences of Covid-19, where seriously ill people can feel generally well, despite damaged lungs,\" it said. Families can collect the devices from July 5 to Aug 5 at more than300FairPrice, Sheng Siong, Giant, Cold Storage, Watsons, Unity and Guardian outlets. They have to present a leaflet at the venue, which will be distributed vialetter boxes between June 28 and July 3. Blood oxygen levels between 95 and 100 per cent are considered healthy, while a level between 90 and 94 per cent is deemed low. Those with low blood oxygen levels may need supplemental oxygenand are advised to consult a doctor, the foundation said. Blood oxygen levels below 90 per cent are \"dangerously low\" and urgent treatment at the Accident and Emergency department is needed. The foundation stressed that blood oxygen readings cannot replace a Covid-19 test as low blood oxygen is not a definite indicator of testing positive for the virus.Low blood oxygen levels can be caused by other underlying conditions or complications. Oximeter readings may also be inaccurate due to trembling hands or the use of nail varnish. The oximeter can be used by placing it around a finger tip and pressing a button to activate the device. A few seconds are needed for the blood oxygen level reading to stabilise. Two numbers will be displayed - the blood oxygen level and pulse rate. Families can check their nearest collection points and operation hours on this website. Collection can be made on behalf of other households, friendsor neighbours by showing their household leaflets. In May last year, Temasek Foundation gave out 8,000 oximeters to foreign workers in dormitories as part of precautionary measures to identify new cases of Covid-19 infection. Workers have to measure their blood oxygen levels and record their oximeter readings twice a day. If an abnormal reading is obtained, the worker is advisedto take another measurement after 30 minutes. If the reading is still abnormal, hewill receive an alert advising him to seek medical help.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. Two new Covid-19 clusters were announced by the Ministry of Health (MOH) yesterday. One cluster is at 90 Redhill Close and the other is linked to a foreign domestic worker who was confirmed to have the coronavirus on June 14. Two cases in the cluster at 90 Redhill Close did not seek medical attention despite developing Covid-19 symptoms and were detected as part of community surveillance testing for residents of the area on Monday. Cases linked to the 90 Redhill Close cluster include a 69-year-old female retiree. She is a family member and household contact of a 79-year-old male retiree who is currently an unlinked case. She developed a sore throat, nausea and vomiting on Monday and sought medical treatment at Singapore General Hospital on the same day. She was tested for Covid-19 on Monday as well, and her test result came back positive that day. Her serology test result is negative, which indicates that this is a recent infection. Meanwhile, the Bukit Merah View Market and Food Centre cluster grew to 81, up from 78. The new cases include an 11-year-old pupil at Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus (Kellock). Three more cases were also linked to two clusters in Bukit Merah View. Among two cases added to the cluster at 121 Bukit Merah View was a 62-year-old part-time cook at Marine Parade Central Market and Food Centre who was last at work on June 6. She was fully vaccinated and her serology test result was negative for the N antigen, which suggested the presence of early infection. A 74-year-old part-time cleaner at Block 104 Henderson Crescent was added to the Block 119 Bukit Merah View cluster after he was detected via testing for residents of the Bukit Merah View area. Other linked cases yesterday included a 23-year-old student at the Singapore Institute of Management. Of the 10 linked cases in the community reported yesterday, three had already been placed under quarantine and seven were detected through surveillance testing. The remaining five cases in the community were unlinked. Among them was a 26-year-old analyst at Deutsche Bank who developed a fever and sore throat on June 15, and a runny nose and cough on June 17. She declined to be tested for Covid-19 after seeking medical treatment that day. She later tested positive for the virus on Monday after another case linked to her tested positive. Three imported cases who had been placed on stay-home notice or isolated on arrival were also confirmed by MOH yesterday. A total of 18 new Covid-19 cases take Singapore's tally to 62,448. There are currently 38 active clusters of infection. Singapore has had 35 deaths from Covid-19 complications, while 15 who tested positive have died of other causes.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - Long Covid-19 syndrome - which sees patients suffer residual symptoms such as fatigue and chest pains weeks and months after infection - has been described in several countries but Singapore\\'s health authorities have yet to get a firm grip on what it entails. This includes what causes \"long Covid\" syndrome, how it manifests and how it can be addressed, Singapore\\'s director of medical services Kenneth Mak said during a virtual press conference held by the multi-ministry task force on tackling Covid-19on Thursday (June 24). Associate Professor Mak noted that there are anecdotal reports that suggest vaccination provides some remedy for long Covid syndrome. \"Some longstanding sufferers of long Covid syndrome have reported improvements in the symptoms after vaccination. And this may potentially be another reason to encourage even recovered cases to seek vaccination,\" he said. Long Covid is a condition where some people continue to experience Covid-19 symptoms for longer than usual, even after recovering from the disease. Fatigue, shortness of breath, chest pain, joint aches and \"brain fog\" - where one\\'s thinking is sluggish - are some commonly described problems that emerge or linger for four weeks or more after an infection. \"The National Centre for Infectious Diseases has been looking at this and has been following up all recovered cases in Singapore\\'s public hospitals, and have also been trying to study this particular issue,\" said Prof Mak. The NCID may be ready soon to provide further information on what the prevalence of long Covid syndrome is in Singapore. Prof Mak said the syndrome reinforces the concern that Covid-19 infection is not something like common seasonal flu. \"There are some patients who have severe outcomes, permanent disabilities to some extent, and these... are not something to underplay.\" Read next: Singapore may ease Covid-19 rules for those vaccinated: How you would be affected Join ST\\'s Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.

       " {'text': 'trending covid 19 claims fact or fiction Read 3 articles daily and stand to win ST rewards, including the ST News Tablet worth $398. Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - Early research findings, anecdotes, facts stitched together from various sources: The Covid-19 pandemic has unleashed a tsunami of information surrounding vaccine safety and efficacy. With so much material, discerning fact from fiction has certainly become tougher. Lim Min Zhang and Clara Chong investigate four claims and lay out how valid each one is. An open letter penned by some doctors which was later retracted, called for children to be given traditional Covid-19 vaccines instead of mRNA ones. Citing a study published in the prestigious US journal Proceedings Of The National Academy Of Sciences (PNAS) last month, the letter suggested evidence had been found that Sars-CoV-2 sequences can be integrated into the DNA of infected human cells in culture. mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid) is a molecule that instructs DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) to make protein. In general, RNA cannot be incorporated into DNA readily. Human DNA is housed in the nucleus of the cell and is separate from the rest of the cell. Movement of molecules in and out of the nucleus is strictly controlled. Since mRNA vaccines only tell human cells to produce the Covid-19 virus\\' spike protein, which the body then mounts an immune response against, the vaccines themselves do not have any other part of the virus\\'s genetic code and cannot make the entire virus itself. \"The mRNA of the spike protein alone is like the body of a car without the engine. It looks like a car but goes nowhere,\" says Professor Ooi Eng Eong, an expert on emerging infectious diseases at Duke-NUS Medical School. There were also several limitations in the study that the doctors referenced, Prof Ooi pointed out. First, the study used a DNA sequencing technique known as high throughput screening, in which multiple genes and even the entire genome can be sequenced simultaneously. This generates a lot of genetic material, and polymerase chain reactions were used to amplify this material. If errors are present, they will be amplified. Experiments were also done in a the artificial environment of a cell line in a test tube, and not in patient tissues. Results from this do not always accurately replicate what occurs in animal or human cells. \"The proof of the pudding will be to find Sars-CoV-2 integrated into the genome of a Covid-19 patient. Despite the many genome level studies that have been done, such an event has not been found. The evidence that Sars-CoV-2 is able to insert its genome into the human genome is thus inconclusive at this stage,\" said Prof Ooi. Dr Geert Vanden Bossche, a Belgian who has a PhD in virology, has claimed that like with antibiotics, there is a risk of building up \"vaccine resistance\". He theorises that because Covid-19 vaccines do not provide perfect protection, people can still get and transmit the coronavirus - allowing more mutations along the way. Eventually, a dangerous variant emerges that existing vaccines are ineffective against. He also purports that the Covid-19 vaccines and public health measures are weakening the ability of the body\\'s innate immune system to fight off the coronavirus. Some of his interviews on YouTube have spread on online forums here. There is a theoretical possibility that a vaccine may induce the body to produce a low level of antibodies that may be insufficient to kill the virus if the person is infected with Sars-CoV-2, the virus which causes the Covid-19 disease. There is then the possibility that the virus may stay in the body and mutate. But international data so far has shown that the coronavirus mutates slowly and if the vast majority of the global population is vaccinated, the chances of mutations happening will be small. Vaccines, which train the body\\'s immune system to fight off the virus in the event of a real infection, have been shown to be highly effective in reducing the number of Covid-19 infections and mortality rate. As for whether the body\\'s natural immunity after being infected could be better at fending off the virus than with the immunity conferred by vaccination, Professor Paul Tambyah, president of the Asia Pacific Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infection, said: \"There is a theoretical possibility that natural infection gives better and more long lasting immunity than vaccination, but most people are not willing to take the risk.\" He added that this idea is not new. In the past, there were those who advocated \"chicken pox parties\" when a child in the neighbourhood had chicken pox instead of having children vaccinated against the disease. \"When people realised that some children can get seriously ill from chicken pox and how safe the chicken pox vaccines are, that idea has gone out of the window,\" Prof Tambyah said. Heart inflammation concerns were raised after six individuals in Singapore were recently reported to have suffered myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart) after getting an mRNA vaccine. Four of them were young men younger than 30. Some have also worried about whether reports of heart attacks and strokes after vaccination could be linked to the jab. Others have claimed that there might be risks to pregnancy, or long-term side effects of the vaccine months, years and decades after the jab. A Telegram group called \"SG Suspected Vaccine Injuries Channel\", which allows anyone to submit suspected side effects from the Covid-19 vaccine, has gained traction in recent weeks, with more than 4,200 subscribers so far. On heart attacks and strokes When trying to determine whether an event was caused by a drug, some factors such as how biologically plausible the event is, the time frame after the dose was taken and if the effect was observed again after reintroduction, needs to be considered, Dr Danny Soon of the Consortium for Clinical Research and Innovation Singapore (Cris) said. Associate Professor Hsu Li Yang, vice-dean of global health at the NUS Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, said that baseline comparisons for side effects also need to be made to tell if there are higher incidents of these conditions after vaccination. \"For more common conditions like heart attacks and strokes that happen on a daily basis in Singapore, it is quite likely that one can have a stroke within a week after vaccination, but which is not actually triggered by the vaccine,\" Prof Hsu said. Dr Soon added: \"Families and loved ones are understandably distraught if their elderly relatives suffer from disability or death following a vaccination, and will seek answers. However, in the search for the truth, it is important that all parties concerned do not mistake the timing of an event with its actual cause.\" Three independent bodies of medical experts in Singapore have reiterated that the risk of heart conditions associated with the Covid-19 mRNA vaccine is \"very small\", and have recommended that people still get the vaccines in the interest of public health. Singapore\\'s Health Sciences Authority said that in general, five to seven individuals per 100,000 people a year are hospitalised for myocarditis or pericarditis. The frequency of heart attacks and strokes in vaccinated people locally is within the background incidence rate, and there is no evidence currently that the vaccines can directly cause these events, HSA said. Doctors added that its exact prevalence of these heart conditions in Singapore is not known as milder cases often go unreported. On risks to pregnancy There is currently no evidence that Covid-19 vaccination causes any problems with pregnancy, including the development of the placenta and also no evidence that fertility problems are a side effect of any vaccine, including Covid-19 vaccines, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. During the Pfizer vaccine clinical trials, 23 women volunteers involved in the study became pregnant. Twelve received the vaccine, and 11 were given a placebo jab. The only one woman who had a miscarriage had not received the actual vaccine, but a placebo. The College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists Singapore and the Obstetrical and Gynaecological Society of Singapore released a joint statement on June 3 to address some of these concerns. Real-world data of almost 4,000 women in the US, who self-identified as pregnant at the time of vaccination or shortly thereafter, has demonstrated safety of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, with no increased risks of adverse pregnancy outcomes, nor any obvious adverse events, it said. On long-term side effects The mRNA vaccine and the protein it triggers production of are both broken down by the human body after a few days. This makes it highly unlikely that there will be side effects that only occur years after. \"Imagine you get a common cold, usually caused by a rhinovirus, which is an RNA virus. This RNA virus also works by giving instructions to your cells to produce a whole set of viral proteins, in order to reproduce. Yet, we do not concern ourselves about the long term effects of getting the common cold,\" said Dr Soon. The majority of vaccine side effects such as injection site pain and swelling, fever, and fatigue are predictable and happen within days of injection. Severe allergic reactions can also happen, but these are rare and for the majority of vaccines usually occur within hours of the injection. Some unusual side effects have been observed weeks after Covid-19 vaccinations, like facial muscle weakness and bleeding. The health authorities are continuing to monitor for these nearer term side effects as vaccinations continue, Dr Soon added. Some people have expressed wariness about the short timeframe of trials and actual use of the Covid-19 vaccines so far. To this point, Dr Soon explains that medicines that are taken short-term may have shorter periods of study. Medications for chronic illnesses such as hypertension or diabetes, which are taken long term or for life, studies of up to several years may be required to better understand efficacy and safety. On the flip side, Dr Soon noted that how long a drug has been in use need not necessarily be correlated with how safe it is. \"Paracetamol has been around for decades and available over the counter, but it has a narrow safety margin, and is one of the leading agents of drug overdose and liver failure,\" he said. An online petition targeting Singaporeans and residents here has gathered more than 2,200 signatures so far had called for ivermectin to be used as part of an outpatient treatment plan for Covid-19. It claims that ivermectin had strong evidence of efficacy against Covid-19, as well as being cheap, safe and effective and has been in use for decades, although it has been overlooked by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and other regulatory bodies. Associate Professor Jenny Low, a senior consultant of infectious diseases from the Singapore General Hospital, said much of the controversy over ivermectin stems from the fact that its proponents have ignored the varying quality of trials testing this drug for Covid-19. \"If we remove the \\'noise\\' of poor quality clinical trials and their reports, and just focus on the ones that are of at least decent quality, then the current evidence does not support the use of ivermectin. That\\'s not to say that the drug definitely does not work. We can only say that with the best evidence out there till date, there is no strong evidence to support its use.\" In March, WHO said current evidence on the use of ivermectin to treat Covid-19 patients was inconclusive, and it recommended that the drug be used only in clinical trials until more data was available. A review by the United States\\' National Institutes of Health, a government medical research agency, has also found that while ivermectin has been shown to inhibit the replication of Sars-CoV-2 in cell cultures, studies suggest that achieving the plasma concentrations necessary for the antiviral efficacy detected in-vitro would require doses of up to 100-fold higher than those approved for use in humans. The agency noted that while there were some published studies that showed some positive results, including lower mortality rates, there were several limitations with the studies. These included small sample sizes, patients receiving other medications in addition to ivermectin, and the studies being open-label, which means information was not withheld from trial participants, introducing possible bias towards the drug being tested. A study done in Singapore in May last year did not find significant preventive benefits either. The study was done with more than 3,000 healthy migrant workers in dormitories, of whom 617 received ivermectin. The others received hydroxychloroquine, povidone-iodine throat sprays, or vitamin C. No statistically significant differences in Covid-19 infection rates were observed between those who took vitamin C versus ivermectin. Prof Low also noted that even the drug\\'s manufacturer, Merck, has advised against the use of ivermectin for Covid-19. There was no scientific basis for a potential therapeutic effect against Covid-19 from pre-clinical studies, it said in February. There was also no meaningful evidence for clinical activity or clinical efficacy in patients with Covid-19, and a concerning lack of safety data in the majority of studies, it added. Prof Low said: \"To me, this says everything.\" Join ST\\'s Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. SPH Digital News / Copyright © 2021 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd.

       " {'text': 'the call on lifting restrictions is not easy in singapores transition phase Read 3 articles daily and stand to win ST rewards, including the ST News Tablet worth $398. Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - The last few days have shown exactly why Singapore opted for a two-step easing of the restrictions put in place during the heightened alert to control Covid-19 cases. When the authorities announced that some curbs would be lifted on Monday (June 14), Singapore had reported single-digit new infections for five straight days. Further restrictions on higher-risk activities such as dining in, masks-off workouts in gyms and singing in live performances or during religious services were to be lifted next Monday. But cases have spiked to double digits for the past few days, fuelled by the growing Bukit Merah cluster that includes a market and food centre. The authorities now have the flexibility to decide whether to go ahead with relaxing the curbs as planned, or keep them in place for another week or two. It is a tough call - and it\\'s a political call rather than a public health one. It\\'s also all about timing. If this had happened three months back, there would have been no easing of measures. In fact, the measures might even be tightened. On the other hand, three months from now, the decision would likely be to lift the curbs. The big difference lies in the proportion of the population that has been vaccinated. Three months back, only about 300,000 people here were fully vaccinated, while three months from now, most of the eligible population would have had at least one dose of the vaccine. Experts say it is almost impossible now to eradicate Covid-19, which they see as becoming endemic. This means infections will continue to occur, and people will have to learn to live with that. So what are the factors that need to be taken into account in deciding whether to ease or tighten restrictions, or maintain the status quo next Monday? Central to any decision Singapore makes is the number of people who have been vaccinated. Vaccination protects against severe illness - the primary worry in any pandemic. Latest figures from the Ministry of Health (MOH) show that 98.6 per cent of people fully vaccinated, 93.6 per cent of those who have had one dose of the vaccine, and 90.8 per cent of those who have not been vaccinated have mild or no symptoms from Covid-19 infection. These are figures since April 28. Last year, when most of the vulnerable had not been vaccinated, the percentage of unvaccinated people with serious illness would have been much higher. Today, close to half the population has received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, with about two million people - more than one in three - fully vaccinated. Associate Professor Hsu Liyang, an infectious diseases expert at the National University of Singapore Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, said half the population with one dose of the vaccine is not enough protection. \"British data suggests only 33 per cent protection from symptomatic disease for the Delta variant with a single Pfizer dose,\" he said. He would like to see at least 60 per cent of the population fully vaccinated before one can breathe easy. It is also important to see just who has been vaccinated. Among the people who are fully vaccinated are the more vulnerable seniors who, should they get infected, are more likely to suffer from severe illness, and even die . Unfortunately, not all who are 60 years and above have chosen to get vaccinated, even though they can now do so without an appointment. Meanwhile, more than one million people, many in their 20s and 30s, are waiting for their first dose of the vaccine, and for peace of mind. After all, the risk of severe illness in younger people, while very much lower, is still there. That said, the vaccination drive is on track and Singapore will be a far more protected country some months down the road. Dr Asok Kurup, who chairs the Academy of Medicine\\'s Chapter of Infectious Disease Physicians, said more important than the number of infections is whether the healthcare system can cope with them. Professor Ooi Eng Eong, an expert in emerging infectious diseases at the Duke-NUS Medical School, agreed: \"It depends on the healthcare resource that can be allocated to Covid-19 cases without affecting access of other cases needing intensive care, ventilators, etc.\" As things stand right now, the number of seriously ill patients requiring oxygen or intensive care is low, at a dozen or fewer in the past week. So there is no threat to the healthcare system. For asymptomatic patients, which means they are not sick at all, or those who suffer only mild symptoms, the issue is ensuring that they do not pass the virus to others. What\\'s important is that as few people as possible get severely ill. A concern is that unlinked cases - and there were 18 in the past week - could lead to more clusters being formed, and perhaps even a surge in cases. But the more people who get vaccinated - and that\\'s happening with 50,000 getting their jabs daily - the less likely this scenario becomes. Those who have been vaccinated serve to break the chain of transmission. Said Prof Ooi: \"Singapore is now in the zone where we could get local cases, but they would not become large clusters that would trouble our healthcare system.\" Since the start of the pandemic more than a year ago, many people have lost their jobs, businesses have failed or are struggling with government help, and the economy has stagnated. Since Covid-19 is likely to become endemic, the question becomes, how many infections is Singapore willing to accept in order for life to return to normal for the majority of the population? Said Prof Dale Fisher, a senior infectious diseases consultant at the National University Hospital (NUH): \"Initially increasing numbers, especially unlinked cases, was a serious health threat. \"Now we expect more unlinked cases as vaccination makes the disease milder. Monitoring severe disease matters more than the number of cases.\" As the threat goes down, people will demand that life return to normal. The question is whether the threat has gone down sufficiently to allow for further easing of measures next week. Associate Professor Alex Cook, an expert in disease modelling at the NUS Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, said: \"The Delta variant is more transmissible. If we want to keep the daily cases from growing, we can\\'t expect phase three measures to suffice, even if we get the cases down temporarily. \"We either need to impose more restrictions, or accept that cases will rise until herd immunity kicks in. \"Given that the highest-risk individuals were all offered vaccination already, one has to wonder why letting cases rise is so unpalatable that distancing measures are preferred.\" Prof Fisher explained that Singapore is in a transition period where many, but not all who want it, have been vaccinated. \"It is tricky,\" he said. \"We still need to look after people who haven\\'t had the chance to be vaccinated yet.\" The question of curbs So should Singapore ease restrictions further, as planned, next Monday? There are several arguments for the easing of curbs. The most vulnerable groups have already been vaccinated and those that have not are at much lower risk of severe illness if infected. The healthcare system seems well-positioned to deal with the people who might fall severely ill. Tens, perhaps even hundreds of thousands of jobs and businesses are on the line. Against this, one must weigh the risk faced by those who are still waiting to be vaccinated. Singapore has just extended vaccination registration to Singaporeans aged 12 to 39 years old. The chances of them getting infected rise if the curbs are relaxed, though they are less likely to fall severely ill, on account of their age. Plus, the curbs could be hurting their livelihoods, too. The authorities will have to weigh the risks and rewards of restrictions, at least till October, by which time everyone who wants to should be vaccinated. Which decision would be more politically palatable? Seeing a rise in infections, the bulk of which are mild, or enduring more weeks of heightened restrictions to bring down the number of infections? With half the population having at least one vaccine dose, perhaps it is time to change strategy from one of containing the virus to one of living with it. At the very least, the dining in restriction should be lifted as there are business repercussions to not opening up the food and beverage sector. With compulsory spaced out seating, restaurants would actually be safer than markets like the one at Bukit Merah, where people tend to mingle more freely. Eventually, while Singapore will likely continue to track all cases, it will no longer need to test and trace them. Its borders, too, could open before year-end to countries where infections are low, and to people who have been vaccinated. Until then, the balancing act will go on, and at least some measures, such as wearing of masks and social distancing, must remain.

       " {'text': 'singapore vietnam looking at easing travel curbs for business and leisure Read 3 articles daily and stand to win ST rewards, including the ST News Tablet worth $398. Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - Singapore and Vietnam are looking at gradually relaxing travel curbs for business and trips to selected tourist sites in the next few months, Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan said on Wednesday (June 23). However, such plans will depend on how fast Vietnam can vaccinate its population. He was speaking at a doorstop via Zoom at the conclusion of a four-day visit to Vietnam capital Hanoi, where he met newly-appointed President Nguyen Xuan Phuc, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chính and Deputy Prime Minister Pham Binh Minh. Dr Balakrishnan said the two nations share a similar strategy to contain the pandemic such as the need for intensive testing, quarantines and mass inoculation. Vietnam has also imposed strict measures such as shutting non-essential businesses and restricting gatherings even before it began to battle its worst outbreak. That started in late April from a church cluster in Ho Chi Minh City and factories in the country\\'s North. Only about 2 per cent of its 98 million population are vaccinated. \"We have also discussed in the next few months, hopefully by the end of the year, how we can gradually and safely liberalise particularly on business travel, and perhaps on selected tourist sites.\" \"But the key thing first is Vietnam needs some time to step up its vaccination programme - so we will wait for them to be ready.\" In the meantime, Dr Balakrishnan said both countries are engaged at the staff level to work on a mutual recognition of vaccine certificates and testing results to build confidence towards border reopening. In new rules announced on Wednesday, travellers from Vietnam are subject to a 14-day quarantine in Singapore at dedicated facilities beginning on June 28, with a mandatory antigen rapid test on the third, seventh and eleventh day after arrival.Previously, they would have to undergo a 21-day stay-home notice. Vietnam has suspended the entry of all foreigners except diplomats, investors, experts and skilled workers. Dr Balakrishnan said Vietnam has also expressed interest in Singapore technology like breathalyser test kits, adding that the Republic will help source and evaluate. On the Myanmar crisis, he said both governments reiterated calls for violence to ceaseand for dialogue to begin.“Vietnam and Singapore stand ready to do what we can without interfering.” Asean leaders in April agreed on a five-point consensus at a special summit in Jakarta, calling for Myanmar to stop violence and start dialogue with its opponents in a process that will be facilitated by a special Asean envoy, aided by the Asean secretary-general. Dr Balakrishnan has acknowledged the slow progress so far, saying at a Special Asean-China Foreign Ministers’ Meeting earlier this month that there had been “no real sign of meaningful political dialogue and negotiation”. The conflict, which started after the army seized power on Feb 1 and removed Ms Aung San Suu Kyi’s elected government, has left at least 870 people dead, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners activist group. Dr Balakrishnan said Singapore and Vietnam share the same position that Asean centrality and unity must be maintained and that “it is even more important for Asean rules to be accentuated (in view of) the regional developments, global developments, superpower rivalry”. In his speech at the Asia-Europe Meeting’s High Level Policy Dialogue on Tuesday, he emphasised the need to strengthen multilateralism and a rules-based system. Hedescribed the cooperation between Asia and Europe as “indispensable” amid complex challenges like climate change and cyber security. “Now more than ever before, we need effective multilateral institutions including the World Health Organisation and the World Trade Organisation. These remain essential avenues to advance our shared interests,” said Dr Balakrishnan. While he commended Europe for being a reliable exporter of Covid-19 vaccines, even when it has not fully inoculated its own population, he also highlighted the “great asymmetry” inthe vaccination rate, with some countries achieving up to 80 per centandothersnot even reaching 1 per cent. He also envisions the same asymmetry in the pace of post-pandemic recovery. “We need to make sure that we do not end up with another stratified world in the way we recover post-Covid-19,” he told the meeting. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) said in a statement on Wednesday that Dr Balakrishnan and Vietnam’s Deputy Prime Ministerexpressed their commitment to strengthen economic and financial cooperation under the Singapore-Vietnam Strategic Partnership, which will mark its 10th anniversary in 2023. Despite the pandemic, bilateral trade grew by 0.1 per cent last year. Singapore has a cumulative investment of over US$56 billion (S$75 billion) in more than 2,600 projects, the statement noted. This year also marks the 25th anniversary of the establishment of the first Vietnam-Singapore Industrial Park, which is said to have attracted US$14 billion in investments and created more than 270,000 jobs in Vietnam. Dr Balakrishnan and Mr Pham Binh Minh also discussed regional developments, including deepening economic integration through the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). Singapore and Vietnam are among 11 countries that have ratified the CPTPP, a free trade alliance that came into force in 2018 after former president Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The two Asean countries are also signatories of the RCEP, another free trade agreement (FTA) that was signed last year between all 10 Asean countries and their partners in the region - Australia, China,Japan, South Korea and New Zealand. The RCEP countries account for 30 per cent of global gross domestic product and have a population of more than three billion people, making the deal the largest FTA in the world. Dr Balakrishnan’stripis the first by a foreign minister since Vietnam’s leadership transition in April. During the trip, he met the chairman of the Communist Party of Vietnam Commission for External Relations Le Hoai Trung and discussedways to strengthen party-to-party relations, the MFA said. Dr Balakrishnan also met Hanoi Party Secretary Dinh Tien Dung, with whom he discussed city-to-city cooperation in areasincluding urban solutions and smart citydevelopment. \"Concluded a busy and fruitful visit to Hanoi - a 1000 year old city with lots of history and culture. Was honoured to be the first Foreign Minister to visit after the new Vietnamese leadership was elected,\" Dr Balakrishnan said inaFacebook post on Wednesday. \"I look forward to continue strengthening partnerships, and deepening the reservoir of trust and goodwill which we have in Vietnam.\" Join ST\\'s Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - Singapore will continue to reopen in a calibrated manner with measures further relaxed from Monday (June 21), the multi-ministry task force on Covid-19 said on Friday (June 18). The announcements came amid a rise in locally transmitted cases over the past weekbrought about by agrowing cluster at the 115 Bukit Merah View market and food centre. More restrictions will be liftedinmid-July, barring a superspreader event or another big cluster emerging. Here are the key announcements: Food and beverage (F&B) establishments will be allowed to resume dining-in services from next Monday but only for up to two diners per group. The Ministry of Health (MOH) said it aims to increase this limit to five people in mid-July, barring a superspreader event or another big cluster emerging. Groups of more than two people from different households will not be allowed to dine together even if they are split across multiple tables. But bigger groups from the same household will be allowed to do so with two diners per table. Recorded music will also not be allowed in F&B establishmentsto minimise the risk of transmission from patrons talking loudly. Diners must continue to observe safe distancing and keep their masks on unless eating or drinking. There is no change to the five-person cap on unique daily visitors to a household. READ FULL STORY:Dining in allowed from June 21 but only in groups of 2, as S\\'pore opts for calibrated Covid-19 opening Wedding receptions, such as wedding dinners or lunches, carry a higher risk as attendees tend to socialise more and over a longer period of time, the MOH said. They will continue to be prohibited at least until mid-July, when further changes will be announced. When wedding receptions are allowed to resume, pre-event testing (PET) will be required for all attendees for events with up to 100 attendees. For events with up to 50 attendees, PET will be required only for the main wedding party, such as the couple and their bridesmaids and groomsmen. The wedding party can have up to 20 attendees, including the couple. Indoor activities that involve participants removing their masks, such as those at gyms and fitness studios, can resume from next Monday. But groups must still be limited to two people and classes will be capped at 30 people, including the instructor. Activities held outdoors can continue in groups of up to five people, but the 30-person cap on the class size remains. READ FULL STORY:Group sizes for indoor, mask-off sports and exercise activities can resume with two from June 21 Workers should continue to work from home as far as possible to reduce overall interaction within workplaces and public places such as public transport, the MOH said. Employers should ensure that workers who need to go into the workplace do so with staggered start times. They should also implement flexible working hours. No cross-deployment of workers to multiple work sites is allowed, and social gatherings as well as work-related events with food and beverages continue to be prohibited. Given the continued restrictions on various activities, the Government will extend enhancements to the Jobs Support Scheme for affected sectors by three weeks. This includes 50 per cent support for businesses that remain closed or have enhanced safety measures in place, such as F&B, gyms and fitness studios, and performing arts and arts education. Other sectors that are significantly affected such as retail, cinemas, museums and family entertainment, will get 30 per cent support. The support will be tapered down to 10 per cent for another two weeks, starting from July 12. Other support measures for hawkers, such as fee subsidies and rental waivers, will continue at least until mid-July. READ FULL STORY:Extended govt support for F&B, hawkers and other sectors hit by Covid-19 measures Regular testing using \"fast and easy\" tests like antigen rapid test (ART) kits will be made mandatory for staff involved in higher risk activities, such as those working in F&B outlets with dining in, personal care services like massage parlours and beauty salons, as well as gyms with unmasked participants. The staff will need to be tested every 14 days. Small businesses that are unable to implement self-supervised swabbing will be able to send their staff to quick test centres. Two centres will be set up in Tekka and Yishun from next Monday, with more to be set up progressively. READ FULL STORY: Mandatory 14-day routine testing for Covid-19 for staff in F&B, hairdressing and other higher-risk settings From next Monday, physical visits to residential care homes serving elderly residents will be allowed to resumeafter such visits were suspended from June 5 to June 20. Visitors will need to take a fast and easy test at the care home and test negative before being allowed entry. The MOH said some care homes may need more time to implement the testing procedure and may resume visits only at a later date. The SafeEntry Gateway box is a device to allow people to check in easily by simply tapping their phones or TraceTogether tokens. In the coming weeks, boxes that allow checking out will be deployed to enable more precise contact tracing efforts. These devices will be deployed at venues with higher visitorship, such as malls, hospitals and polyclinics, as well as places where individuals with their masks off are likely to be in close proximity for prolonged periods, such as F&B establishments and gyms. Eligible businesses will be notified in the coming weeks. TraceTogether and SafeEntry data will be used to strengthen ring-fencing efforts and prevent large clusters from forming. Health alerts will be sent by SMS to those who have visited hot spots on the same days as infected persons and may have been exposed to infections. They will be required to undergo mandatory testing at designated testing centres and stay isolated until they get their results. They will also be given self-test kits to use at home to confirm they are not infected. Further details on this testing requirement will be announced later.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - There were no big crowds at hawker centres and coffee shops on Mondaymorning (June 21)when dining in resumed for groups of two. But those The Straits Timesspoke to said they were glad that the ban on dining inimposed since May 16 to stem a rise in the number of Covid-19 community caseshasbeen lifted. Some stalls at Amoy Street Food Centre saw queues of around 10 to 15 people each at noon, as tables filled up quickly with diners sticking to the rule of two.Cleaners were also out in full force, clearing tables soon after people finished their meals to make the space available for the next pair. Over at Ion Orchard, popular eateries such as TWG Tea and The Marmalade Pantry were about half full despite the reduced capacity. The mall was shut for four days for cleaning and disinfecting works from June 12 to June 16 after a number of Covid-19 cases were linked to it. Visitors to the mall on Monday said they were glad the restaurants in town were open again. Facilities team manager Nazurudeen Salim, who was looking to have dessert with his wife at the Marmalade Pantry, said they missed eating out. The 31-year-old added that the restrictions had made it difficult for them to catch up with friends and clients over a cup of coffee. Executive officer Caleb Huang, 34, said it felt good to be back in the shopping belt. He was having lunch with a friend at the Food Republic in Wisma Atria. “During phase 2 (heightened alert), I had fewer food choices as I didn’t seethe point in going out to town and was limited to takeaways in my neighbourhood,” he said. Business development manager Lydia Ang, 41, who was having lunch at Food Opera in Ion said that she would usually go to Raffles Place or Orchard for lunch. “It’s important to take a breather from work, for meals or even coffee breaks, even if it’s just for a while. That’s why I’m relieved that dining in is now possible,” she said. Earlier on Monday morning, stallholders inClementi and Yew Tee said that while many patrons continue to opt for takeaways, they expect to see more people dining in over the coming days. Mr Mohamed Jameel, 46, manager of a stall selling Indian and Muslim food, said that the number of customers dropped by around 50 per cent to 60 per cent during the period of heightened alert. \"With the new measures, I hope to see more customers at my stall and I\\'m relieved that at least groups of two people are allowed to dine in\", he said. When ST visited the S-11 Choa Chu Kang 787 Food Court and a Foodfare coffee shop at around 8am, tables still remained largely empty, though snaking queues had formed at some stalls. Many people were seen taking away food on their way to work. Retired engineerHussein Wahid, 67, who was having coffee and toast alone, said it was good to return to his familiar routine of having breakfast out on weekday mornings after exercising. Other diners also told ST that they were glad to finally be able to dine in - as it meant returning to some semblance of normality. A doctor whowanted to be known only as Mr Tansaid that he had been eating in his car throughout the period of heightened alert, as all staff working in his clinic have been told to do so, in order to keep the premises clean and to avoid attracting pests. While the restrictions have now been lifted, he said that he and his family will continue to eat at home more often than dining in, as half of them are still working from home. \"I think it\\'s safe to dine out, unless more clusters form or the spread is worse. I\\'m worried about clusters like the one at the Bukit Merah View market... so I\\'m still keeping a lookout for where these clusters are and to try and avoid places with high human traffic,\" he said. The cluster at Bukit Merah View Market and Food Centre had grown to 73 cases as atSunday. Similarly, Mr Benedict Khoo, 21, who was having breakfast with his sister, Ms Kimberly Khoo, 20, both students, said that the siblings are not really worried about the current Covid-19 situation. \"However, the rest of our family members are more scared about eating out, especially our grandmother. They tell us not to go too far and to eat nearby at places that are within walking distance. \"We are always careful, ensuring that we wear our masks and observe social distancing measures,\" he said. Diners at the Clementi 448 Market andFood Centre and the Clementi Kopitiam also told ST that they were relieved to return to the convenience of dining in, and saidthat the current measures were reasonable in helping to curb the spread of Covid-19. Technician Pang Li Ping, 40, said that she used to eat at Clementi Kopitiam with her colleague daily before work. However, with the dine-in restrictions, she and her colleague had to take away their food and eat in the company\\'s allocated rooms. But the food was less tasty, she lamented. Manager May Fong, 52, who usually eats at the food centre with her husband twoor three times a week, said: \"We found ourselves visiting the supermarket more often and cooking more. This is not a concern for me, though I did miss the lively atmosphere of (eating at) a hawker centre. \"However, I feel that having the two-people rule is a wise one. We need to strike a balance - to diminish and curb the spread of Covid-19 and also to allow businesses to improve in hawker centres.\" Join ST\\'s Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.

       " {'text': 'no evidence that covid 19 jabs increase risk of miscarriage foetal anomaly Read 3 articles daily and stand to win ST rewards, including the ST News Tablet worth $398. Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - There is no evidence of increased risks for mothers-to-be who take a Covid-19 vaccine, said experts. Data from nearly 4,000 pregnant women in the United States showed there was no greater risk of miscarriage, foetal anomaly or pre-term labour, said Professor Tan Hak Koon from KK Women\\'s and Children\\'s Hospital (KKH). Prof Tan, who is chairman of the hospital\\'s division of obstetrics and gynaecology, spoke to The Straits Times after concerns were raised by five parents who wrote a letter to KKH last week. The letter, which circulated in online chat groups, asked for evidence on vaccine safety from controlled clinical trials. Among other things, it said that \"of particular concern\" were the risks of miscarriages and birth defects. The study Prof Tan cited looked at 3,958 pregnant women who were vaccinated from Dec 14 last year to Feb 28. Fifty-four per cent received the Pfizer-BioNTech jab, while the rest had the Moderna one. The study was peer-reviewed and published in the highly regarded New England Journal of Medicine in April. Its findings indicate that there are no higher risks of adverse outcomes to mothers and their babies, and that the vaccine is safe to take at any point in pregnancy. Prof Tan said that to assess whether the risks could be higher, comparison needs to be made with the baseline risk. The background risk for foetal anomaly is about 3 per cent to 3.5 per cent, he noted. For miscarriage, it is about 15 per cent, and for pre-term labour, it is 8 per cent to 12 per cent. A pre-term birth refers to the birth of a baby before 37 weeks. In the study, the rate of foetal anomaly reported was 2.6 per cent, Prof Tan said. For miscarriage, it was 13.5 per cent, and for pre-term labour, it was 8.6 per cent. He said: \"All these fall within the normal background risk.\" He said that since the official launch on June 14 of vaccination for pregnant women at KKH, more than 80 bookings have been made with the hospital, which is an \"encouraging\" response. Those who are pregnant have since June 4 been able to register for Covid-19 vaccination under the national programme. They were previously advised to hold off until more information was available. The Ministry of Health (MOH) said on May 31 that the Expert Committee on Covid-19 Vaccination had reviewed data as inoculation was rolled out to pregnant women globally, and found no evidence to suggest that the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna shots could cause harm. However, as the amount of data collected from this population segment is still much smaller compared with that from the general population, the ministry advised mothers-to-be to discuss the matter with their doctors. MOH said the vaccine was safe for women who were breastfeeding, with no need to suspend it if they wanted to get the jab. Prof Tan said that the risk of vaccination has to be considered against that of getting Covid-19. \"Because of physiological changes during pregnancy, pregnant women are less able to tolerate any respiratory infection, not just Covid-19, but also flu and pneumonia, for instance,\" he said. The College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists Singapore and the Obstetrical and Gynaecological Society of Singapore told ST in a joint statement last Friday (June 18) that there is published data showing that pregnant women who become infected with Covid-19 are at higher risk of developing severe illness. They are thus more likely to require admission to an intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation and oxygen treatment. The babies may also need to be delivered early to help the mothers\\' heart and lung functions. \"This means that symptomatic Covid-19 pregnant women are twice more likely to have pre-term births, and their babies are also more likely to need admission to the neonatal intensive care unit,\" the joint statement said. It added that while there are to date no published clinical trials of Covid-19 vaccines that included pregnant women, Pfizer and BioNTech had completed a developmental and reproductive toxicity study that showed no evidence of fertility or reproductive toxicity in animals. An MP for Sengkang GRC, MsHe Ting Ru, who gave birth last December and had her first Covid-19 jab last week, said she had been concerned over whether it was safe for her youngest son, who is fully breastfed, if she took the vaccine. With the revised guidelines from MOH for pregnant and breastfeeding mums, she consulted her doctor, who gave her the go-ahead. \"There is a lot of misinformation out there, but we are facing a serious pandemic and should do our part to protect segments of the population by getting vaccinated if we are able to,\" said the mother of three.

       " {'text': 'residents of 66 eng watt street get tested Read 3 articles daily and stand to win ST rewards, including the ST News Tablet worth $398. Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. Residents from a block of flats in Tiong Bahru trickled slowly into a pavilion for mandatory Covid-19 swab tests yesterday morning. This comes after 13 residents from three households at Block 66 Eng Watt Street tested positive for the coronavirus, and the Health Ministry is hoping to disrupt any wider, undetected community transmission. Ms Janine Stein, 59, a publisher in the entertainment industry, was among the first to get swabbed when testing operations began at 9am. She found out about the mandatory swabbing the previous evening from the notices put up around the block. \"I was really worried because this was my first time taking a swab test. I spoke to some friends who said it was really painful, sore and uncomfortable, but actually it was okay,\" said Ms Stein, who is fully vaccinated against Covid-19. She added that she was worried after hearing about the cases in her block, especially since it is not clear how the cases could be linked or how transmission had occurred. She purchased an antigen rapid test self-test kit for peace of mind, in case she were to meet other people. The test result was negative. \"The staff at the pavilion said it is not a quarantine and I can carry on (with normal activities), but I think it\\'s more responsible if I do the rapid test,\" she said. Ms Stein said she is currently working from home but will be limiting her movements. She usually visits the nearby Tiong Bahru market every few days but decided not to go in the afternoon. \"Until we see where these cases go, I\\'m really limiting my movements. It\\'s not worth taking the risk,\" she said. Madam Adeline Tan, 47, a sales manager, headed to the pavilion for testing with her eight-year-old daughter and her domestic helper at around 10am. All three completed their swab tests within 15 minutes. Her husband, who was at home caring for their five-year-old son, went to get swabbed later. Madam Tan said there was no queue, possibly due to the rain. \"My daughter had a little bit of discomfort but it was manageable. I also felt it was okay,\" said Madam Tan, who has received one dose of the vaccine and will get her second next Monday. She said she was not particularly worried about the cases in her block and will continue to do her grocery shopping in the area. \"I just keep ensuring personal hygiene, I seldom go out, and my kids are always at home during this period. Additionally, this block is a walk-up so there are no lifts, and so no contact from enclosed areas,\" she added. Madam Tan said after the test results are out, she will inform her daughter\\'s primary school that she is living in a block with confirmed Covid-19 cases, just to keep the school in the loop. \"She is now still on home-based learning till July 6, so if nothing goes wrong and the result is negative, she will go back to school then,\" said Madam Tan. She will keep her younger son at home from pre-school for a day tomorrow as a precaution. The mandatory testing for all residents at Block 66 Eng Watt Street continues today, from 9am to 4pm, at the pavilion at 2D Boon Tiong Road. Visitors and those who have interacted with residents from the block between June 8 and 22 are also encouraged to go for testing.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - More thanhalf, or 51.1 per cent, of the Covid-19 cases detected in the 115 Bukit Merah View Market and Hawker Centre - now Singapore\\'s largest open cluster with 82 infections - were not vaccinated. At least 219,000 tests have been conducted in various nearby areas over the past three weeksas part of aggressive community surveillance measures. And among community clusters in Singapore, the common modes of transmission are workplace and office settings, food and beverage outlets - including among delivery riders from one - and households and close contacts in social settings. Singapore\\'s director of medical services, Associate ProfessorKenneth Mak, gave these updates during a multi-ministry task force press conference on Thursday (June 24). He revealed that the index case in the 115 Bukit Merah View cluster is a sundry store owner, before the virus spread to other stalls, stall owners, tenants, social contacts and patrons of the market and food centre. In this cluster, 36.7 per cent of them are fully vaccinated. More thanhalf - 46 - of the total cases are not household-related; 16 were detected from surveillance or community testing operations; and 27 isolated or quarantined before detection, said ProfMak. The market and food centre will remain closed until Saturday. He also noted the presence of other clusters in the vicinity, such as in Tiong Bahru, Redhill and the Enabling Village, a community and social enterprisehub nearby. The Ministry of Health is tracking and studying these clusters to confirm if there are links to the 115 Bukit Merah View cluster. There were 39 community clusters as at Wednesday night. Three of the 10 large clusters will close by the end of June, said Prof Mak, if there are no more cases detected within them. These include the clusters at 506 Hougang Avenue 8 as well as Chevy\\'s Bar and Bistro. He noted that while overall community numbers have increased in the past week compared withthe week before, the proportion of unlinked cases has dropped from 25 per cent to 21per cent over the same stretch. Of the linked cases, 46 per cent were already in quarantine and 33 per cent were detected through surveillance. The share of infections picked up on entry into quarantine has also decreased from 18.8 per cent on June 16 to 5.5 per cent on June 22. \"This suggests that we are getting more cases more quickly, as a result of the aggressive testing that we\\'ve been doing,\" said Prof Mak. He added that all five cases in intensive care as reported on Wednesday were unvaccinated. \"It reinforces our concern that those who are not vaccinated, if infected, may get a more severe case of the disease,may require oxygen supplementation; or even ICU care,\" he said. He repeated the call for those who have yet to be vaccinated to register for their jabs. \"Our seniors, in particular, will be hard hit if the clusters increase, or if more clusters like that we see in Bukit Merah break through in our community,\" said Prof Mak.

       " {'text': 'experts say new rule on covid 19 test for spore citizens and prs overseas not a Read 3 articles daily and stand to win ST rewards, including the ST News Tablet worth $398. Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - A new requirement that Singapore citizens and permanent residents (PRs) must test negative for Covid-19 before being allowed to return home from high-risk countries kicked in at midnight on Sunday (May 30). Infectious diseases experts say the move will help to protect front-line staff at the airport and could help to ease the load on Singapore\\'s healthcare system, which has had to deal with a spike in community cases in recent weeks. But they also note that the measure has its limitations and implementing it is not as straightforward as it seems. At least one legal expert has raised the issue of the constitutionality of the new requirement with the Government. The Ministry of Health (MOH) said last Wednesday that, from 11.59pm on Saturday, all Singaporeans and PRs returning to the country will have to present a valid negative Covid-19polymerase chain reaction(PCR) test taken within 72 hours before their departure. This is the first time MOH has required Singaporeans and PRs to take a pre-departure test. The ministry had previously said it did not want to make it difficult for them to return home, should they be caught unprepared by rapidly deteriorating pandemic conditions abroad. The Immigration and Checkpoints Authority\\'s (ICA) SafeTravel website says those travelling by plane or by boat will have to present their test result at the air and sea checkpoints upon arrival in Singapore. Those who have stayed in lower-risk areas, including Australia, Brunei, China, Hong Kong, Macau and New Zealand, for the last 21 days are exempted. Children aged six and below are also exempted from the new requirement. At land checkpoints, only PRs entering Singapore will need to present a validnegative test result. PRs who arrive in Singapore overland without a validnegative test result may be denied entry. Those who fail to comply with the new requirement may have their entry or re-entry permit cancelled. Travellers must be tested by an accredited or authorised health centre in the country or region of departure. Documentary proof is required and ICA recommends that travellers ask for a copy of the PCR test report that is in English or accompanied by an English translation, contains the traveller\\'s name, date of birth and passport number, and shows the date and result of the test. Mr Fin Chua, 30, who has been living in Thailand for eight years, planned to fly back to Singapore next week to visit his father, who lives alone. After hearing about the pre-departure test requirement, the business owner considered moving his flight earlier so he could return before the measure kicked in. Ultimately, Mr Chua did not do so. Instead, he moved his flight back by two weeks to mid-June, citing the lengthy 21-day stay-home notice he would have to serve if he came back home now. Mr Chua feels that the new requirement is onerous as it is not easy getting a Covid-19 PCRtest in Bangkok . He said a PCR test in the Thai capital costs about 2,000 baht (S$85) at a government clinic and 4,000 baht at a government hospital, but it is hard for foreigners to get tested as Thais get priority. The wait to get tested at the clinics can take hours, he said, unless one pays more to join a priority queue, which means a wait time of 15 to 30 minutes. Ms Cheryl Wong, 30, who works in the film industry in New York, said she did not mind the new requirement as getting tested for Covid-19 in the US city is easy and there are free services. \"If I lived somewhere else with fewertesting options and undetermined turnaround times, I\\'d probably be more annoyed,\" added Ms Wong, who is returning home on May 31 to renew her US work visa and to see her family after being away for1½ years. She noted, though, that the new test requirement did not appear to take into account Singaporeans or PRs who had already been vaccinated, or that individuals may still test positive even though they may no longer be infectious. She said: \"I\\'m pretty sure I\\'ll test negative because I\\'m fully vaccinated and I am still cautious. But there is that little bit of a \\'what if\\'.\" Mr Samuel Phua, 23, who is coming home next month after graduating from the Sibelius Academy in Finland, is also somewhat anxious about the pre-departure test. \"It is allergy season here, and pollen allergies and Covid-19 have symptoms that are quite similar. I got myself tested recently and my results were negative, but there\\'s always that sliver of doubt and worry that the next one may be positive.\" But Mr Phua also said that the new requirement is an important step towards ensuring the safety of Singaporeans both abroad and back home. Dr Ling Li Min, an infectious disease physician from Rophi Clinic, said the decision to require citizens and PRs to take pre-departure tests before they are allowed entry would have been a difficult one for the authorities to make. Limited access to swab testing facilities in some countries means that Singaporeans living in places where Covid-19 is raging may not be able to return home. But with the recent spate of unlinked community cases, Dr Ling said, the authorities now have several fires to fight and the new testing requirement will help to minimise the risk of the virus spreading in Singapore. This is especially in the light of the fact that the Changi Airport cluster - Singapore\\'s largest active cluster with more than 100 cases - was traced to staff interactions with a family who flew in from South Asia. While Dr Ling acknowledged that PCR tests may not pick up every single case, she said the mandatory pre-departure tests will at least help to identify those who are infectious and prevent the virus from spreading on board flights into Singapore. She added: \"It is evident that a key vulnerability exists from when passengers disembark until they are taken to their stay-home notice facility. This measure would further reduce the potential exposure to the virus for that part of the journey.\" Professor Paul Tambyah, deputy director of the National University of Singapore (NUS) Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine\\'s Infectious Diseases Translational Research Programme, also said the new measure would protect Changi Airport staff. \"If this screening reduces the number of infected people passing through the airport even by a small proportion, it might reduce the risk to staff - in particular to those who, for some reason or another, cannot take the vaccines,\" he said. Asked if the authorities should also extend the pre-departure test requirement to Singaporeans and PRs returning from lower-risk places, Prof Tambyah said it would be logical to mandate the test for everyone. \"Taiwan and Vietnam were previously considered low-risk places, as was the state of Victoria in Australia. These classifications can change rapidly,\" he added. Professor Teo Yik Ying, dean of NUS\\' Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, said implementing the new requirement may be more challenging than anticipated. Echoing a point made by Prof Tambyah, Prof Teo said not every jurisdiction will have commercial PCR testing capacity that is accredited and trustworthy. Hence, there is a need to ensure that Singaporeans and PRs who intend to travel to Singapore are able to access proper testing. Otherwise, the testing requirement could be additional logistical hurdles for those returning as they would have to transit in cities where these tests are available, Prof Teo said. He added: \"It will not be useful if returning travellers simply pay for a substandard test or a forged negative PCR test certificate.\" There is also the issue of the Government\\'s responsibility towards citizens who test positive and cannot return home on a commercial flight. MOH said travellers who test positive on their pre-departure test should seek medical care and ensure that they have fully recovered and are non-infectious before travelling to Singapore. Singaporeans who test positive for Covid-19 while overseas and require urgent medical care can still return home via a medical evacuation flight or any other equivalent form of transport. Singapore Management University assistant professor of law Benjamin Joshua Ong noted that Article 13(1) of the Singapore Constitution states that no citizen of Singapore shall be \"banished or excluded\" from Singapore. The courts have not ruled on the precise meaning of the words \"banished\" or \"excluded\", he said. \"It is possible that those words mean that anything preventing a citizen of Singapore from travelling to Singapore would be unconstitutional. On the other hand, a court might also hold that it is acceptable for certain requirements to be imposed on citizens before they can return... \"I think it is at least arguable that, if the restrictions are too onerous, then those restrictions would in substance amount to banishment or exclusion,\" he added. Prof Ong said he has written to MOH for more information about the precise legal basis for the new pre-departure test requirement. He also suggested that exceptions be allowed, citing a hypothetical case of a Singaporean abroad whose overseas visa or work permit may be expiring but cannot get access to a Covid-19 test in time to return home, putting him at risk of overstaying. However, SMU law don Eugene Tan said that while at first glanceit might appear that the pre-departure test requirement for Singaporeans is in breach of Article 13(1), this is not the case. “While Article 13(1) is not explicitly subjected to any derogations or restrictions, a citizen who is not in Singapore voluntarily cannot be said to be banished or excluded,” Associate Professor Tan said. Instead, the testing requirement only means that a citizen will not be allowed to board a flight or ferry to Singapore unless he has a negative Covid-19 test result. If the citizen does somehow make the journey to Singapore, he will unlikely be denied entry, Prof Tan added. “In other words, the pre-departure test requirement imposes a duty on the flight or ferry operator to ensure that all passengers travelling to Singapore have the necessary negative test results based on their travel histories. The constitutional guarantee provided by Article 13(1) is in no way under threat.” Prof Tambyah said there seems to be a reluctance to ban flights and replace them with evacuation flights like what was done with Wuhan at the start of the pandemic. Hence, the new measure is a logical option despite its limitations. Prof Teo said he believes that the Singapore Government will not leave any citizen in the lurch during a medical emergency, but stressed that individuals also need to bear responsibility should they choose to travel out of Singapore while the pandemic is still raging globally. He added: \"This is really a reminder to Singaporeans and PRs that they should avoid unnecessary travel out of Singapore during this period, and if they choose to do so, to ensure they have the necessary insurance coverage for Covid-19 medical evacuation if infected.\" Join ST\\'s Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.

       " {'text': 'unlinked covid 19 cases connection to clusters found within days in singapore Read 3 articles daily and stand to win ST rewards, including the ST News Tablet worth $398. Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - It has so far taken just over four days for contact tracing efforts to establish links between seemingly unrelated cases and existing clusters, with experts saying it suggests the work put in to contain the spread of community cases may be working. They note that with ring-fencing strategies and phase two (heightened alert) measures, clusters have been kept small. There are currently 47 active clusters, with almost half (46.8 per cent) of them having five cases or fewer. Three in 10 clusters (29.8 per cent) consist of three cases, the minimum for it to be defined as a cluster in Singapore. The largest active cluster is the Changi Airport one with 108 cases. Checks by The Straits Times showed that from the time a case is first reported as unlinked, it has taken an average of 3.2 days to establish a link to at least one other case. For cases linked to clusters, it has taken an average of 4.5 days to find the link. However, some have taken a longer time. The White Sands mall cluster\\'s index case - the earliest known case in a cluster - was first reported as an unlinked case on May 13. It took 23 days before the case was linked to three others to form the cluster on June 5. Singapore provides daily updates on the number of Covid-19 infections, but they are reported as at noon each day, which means any links found after that time are not reflected until the following day. Professor Teo Yik Ying, dean of the National University of Singapore\\'s (NUS) Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, said: \"By the cut-off time each day, if no links can be established for the new cases, they will be tentatively classified as unlinked cases, but many of them subsequently become linked to known cases and clusters. \"It is simply a matter of the amount of time and effort required for the contact tracing efforts to be concluded.\" In tracing individual cases to known infections, some may initially be linked to smaller clusters before their connections to larger clusters are uncovered. For instance, the 63 confirmed cases in the Jem and Westgate cluster include 14 who were initially reported as unlinked. Some of them were later linked to small clusters involving their family members or household contacts. But it was later established that these small clusters were in fact related to the Jem and Westgate cluster. Experts say it is important to identify connections to other cases, as unlinked cases could suggest hidden reservoirs of infections and trigger large-scale community outbreaks. \"This is why there are all these efforts to perform community surveillance, where entire blocks of residents or patrons to affected malls are invited down for testing,\" said Prof Teo. He added that many of the new clusters emerging recently, including those in the north-east region of Singapore such as the Hougang cluster, may actually be linked to one another. \"We have just not discovered the infected individuals between these links,\" he said. Prof Teo noted that surveillance efforts are even more important now compared with last year, since there is now a more infectious B16172, or Delta, variant. \"Just a handful of undetected cases can easily trigger a cascading effect to produce many more cases in the community and within a much shorter time span too,\" he added. But Associate Professor Alex Cook, vice-dean of research at the NUS Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, said there is a lower risk now of infections remaining hidden compared with last year. \"If we look at the number of cases in the intensive care unit, they are much lower than they were in the run-up to the circuit breaker last year, even though the number of community cases being found was similar. This points to improved detection of community cases now.\" The current outbreak in Singapore started in late April. Since then, there have been 658 new Covid-19 cases reported in the community. Of those, 147 cases, or 22.3 per cent, were initially reported as unlinked. More than half - 81 cases - have since been linked to clusters. Another 15 cases were linked to one other case each. Five cases had positive serology test results, indicating that they had old infections at the time they were tested and were no longer infectious. Three others were later reclassified as imported cases by the Ministry of Health (MOH). A further 43 cases, or 29.3 per cent of the 147 cases initially reported as unlinked, still have no known links to date. The seven-day moving average for new daily community cases has climbed from 5.3 on April 28 to a peak of 28.4 on May 19, before falling to 15 on June 4. The number of new unlinked cases has also come down, from a peak of 9.1 on May 19 to 2.1 on June 4. MOH calculates the seven-day moving average as the average of the number of cases on a given day, the three days before and the three days after. Prof Teo said the fall in unlinked cases could be attributed to heightened alert measures that have been in place since May 16. The measures, which include making working from home the default and banning dining in, have greatly reduced movements and interactions, thereby minimising opportunities for people to get infected in the community, he said. Another factor could be that large clusters at TTSH and Changi Airport have been brought under control, Prof Cook said. On Sunday, the TTSH cluster was closed after no new cases were linked to it for 28 days. It had a total of 48 confirmed cases. \"If the (new) clusters are smaller, that could indicate that contact tracing is identifying the cases quicker before they can spread further, or the impact of phase two (heightened alert) measures on reducing contacts between people,\" Prof Cook said. \"Either way, it\\'s a good sign, but most important is the reduction in the number of unlinked cases.\" The cases who remain unlinked after some time may have become infected through contact with contaminated surfaces or poorly ventilated environments rather than direct contact with an infected person. \"The Delta variant that is responsible for the community outbreak now is so transmissible, I suspect contaminated surfaces and poorly ventilated environments may be responsible for more transmissions than previously in 2020,\" Prof Teosaid. \"This makes the process of contact tracing a lot more difficult, even with TraceTogether and SafeEntry. That is why there is a stepped-up regime of large-scale optional testing when specific locations have been frequented by a number of infected cases, instead of simply notifying the public of these locations.\" Join ST\\'s Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.

       " {'text': '157 serious suspected reactions reported out of nearly 37 million doses of covid 19 Read 3 articles daily and stand to win ST rewards, including the ST News Tablet worth $398. Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - There have been 157 reports here of suspected reactions to the Covid-19 vaccine severe enough to be life-threatening or result in hospitalisation, among other serious conditions. However, no deaths have been linked to the jab, the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) said on Friday (June 11). These \"suspected serious adverse events\" made up 0.004 per cent of the almost 3.7 million doses of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna jabs administered till May 23. These serious cases form part of the 4,704 \"suspected adverse events reports\" that HSA received till May 23. This translates into 0.13 per cent of administered doses, which is consistent with the percentage that had been reported by the authority on May 6, when it last gave an update on the safety record of both mRNA vaccines on May 6. These reactions are suspected to be associated with the vaccinations, but may not have been caused by them. An adverse event or reaction related tovaccination is any undesirable medical condition that occurs after taking the vaccine, which does not necessarily have a direct link to the treatment. They may be coincidental or related to an undiagnosed disease, but have to be reported by healthcare providers to HSA. Reactions are considered serious if they result in hospitalisation, disability or life-threatening illnesses, among other things. Anaphylaxis, which is the rapid onset of severe allergic reactions, was the most frequently reported serious adverse event, with26 such cases. All of them recovered after medical treatment, HSA said. It added that the incidence rate of anaphylaxis reported here with the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines is about 0.85 cases for every 100,000 doses of the jabs administered. \"This is similar to the incidence rates reported overseas of around 0.5 to twoper 100,000 doses administered,\" said HSA. Other severe allergic reactions numbered 23. These includebreathing difficulty, fast heart rate, an increase or decrease in blood pressure, chest discomfort and pain, fainting, limb numbness and weakness or pain, changes in vision, increase in liver enzymes, joint pain, fits, ringing in the ears and infections. The authority said most of those who had developed serious adverse events have recovered or are recovering. \"These serious adverse events are being closely monitored by HSA,\" it added. HSA said that the most commonly reported reactions are consistent with those typically observed following vaccination. From the 4,704 reactions, the most common one was cases of rash, which accounted for more than onein fourreported adverse events. This was followed by cases of swelling of eyelids, face or lips, which occurred in about onein sevencases. These are typically resolved within a few days and are in line with the events described in the Covid-19 vaccines product information, as well as those reported overseas. Most of adverse events were associated with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which was rolled out for use here on Dec 30 last year and comprised 83 per cent of the doses administered. Moderna was deployed on March 12 this year. About 68 per cent of the total number of reactions reported wasamong people below the age of 60. HSA pointed out that trials of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines found that those younger than 60 tend to experience more adverse effects occurring soon after vaccination, compared withthose older. Generally, younger people have more active immune responses and may experience more adverse effects to the vaccines, said HSA. It pointed out that this is part of the body\\'s natural response to build immunity against Covid-19 infection. The authority added that 64 per cent of these reactions were reported in females. Its update also noted that a greater frequency of heart attacks and strokes has not been observed in vaccinated persons locally. This comes after it was announced on Friday that six people have been reported to have suffered heart inflammation after receiving Covid-19 vaccines - four of whom were men aged below 30. As a precaution, experts have advised that vaccinated people, especially adolescents and younger men, should avoid strenuous physical activity for one week after their second dose. \"It is important to note that heart attacks and strokes can occur naturally within our population, regardless of whether people are vaccinated or not,\" said HSA. \"Due to the large numbers of people being vaccinated, it is expected that, by coincidence, some individuals may experience other medical events such as heart attacks and strokes in the days or weeks after vaccination which may not be related to the vaccination.\" HSA said it is monitoring the incidence of anaphylaxis and Bell\\'s palsy, which are adverse events historically reported with vaccines. There have been 45 reported cases of Bell\\'s palsy, which causes temporary weakness or paralysis of facial muscles. Most of the cases were not serious, HSA said, and patients will generally have completely recovery even without treatment. The incidence rate for this reaction in Singapore is estimated to be 3.35 per 100,000 persons per month. HSA said that this is within the background incidence of 1.1 to 4.4 per 100,000 persons per month before the introduction of vaccination. The authority said that it, along with the Ministry of Health, will continue to monitor the safety of Covid-19 vaccines closely and update the public onany significant safety concerns detected with the vaccines. Overall, the benefits of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines continue to outweigh the known risks of Covid-19 disease and its severe complications in a pandemic, HSA added.

       " {'text': 'singapore employers cannot require staff to disclose covid 19 vaccination status Read 3 articles daily and stand to win ST rewards, including the ST News Tablet worth $398. Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - Employers here have no legal power to force staff members to disclose their Covid-19 vaccination status or demand that they get inoculated. Experts and employers noted that while vaccination is strongly encouraged in Singapore, it remains voluntary, although there are several ways people can be encouraged to get a jab. These will come more into focus as Singapore begins rolling out Covid-19 vaccinations to the wider population, with bookings open to Singaporeans aged 12 to 39 from Friday (June 11). Singapore Human Resources Institute (SHRI) president Low Peck Kem told The Straits Times that unless there is a business need, employers should not compel staff to disclose if they have had a jab or take punitive action against those who do not get inoculated or refuse to update their vaccination status. \"Even if there is a strong business need, such as needing to know in order to determine if the employee can travel for business or to deploy to higher-risk front-line facing roles, do explain clearly why the company needs to know the status and generally, most employees will comply,\" she said. Institute for Human Resource Professionals (IHRP) chief executive Mayank Parekh said that bosses should not use non-vaccination as a reason to terminate employment as there could be medical reasons for why a staff memberdid not get a shot. Mr Tan Wei Ming, senior associate at law firm CMS Holborn Asia, said that if employers want to keep records on vaccinated employees that contain personal data such as names, they must do so in accordance with the Personal Data Protection Act and other applicable data protection laws. \"For these reasons, companies in Singapore are unlikely to make their employees declare their vaccination status at this juncture,\" he added. WongPartnership joint head of employment practice Jenny Tsin said staff members should not face discrimination arising from their vaccination status, given that its voluntary. However, there could be circumstances that warrant a different approach, such as for jobs involving higher risk of exposure to Covid-19, she added. In this instance, it could be more justified to limit return to the workplace to only vaccinated employees. Investment bank Goldman Sachs recently ordered its employees in the United States to report their Covid-19 vaccination status as part of their plans to return to the office, AFP reported on Thursday. ST understands that Goldman Sachs is not requiring staff here to report their vaccination status, and that most are still working from home. While professional services firm EY strongly encourages its eligible staff to get vaccinated, it does not require them to declare their status given that immunisation is not mandatory, said the Singapore and Brunei managing partner Max Loh. UOB human resources head Dean Tong said the bank has been encouraging staff in critical roles to get vaccinated since the Government announced its roll-out to essential workers in the financial sector in March. ST understands that UOB does not track the vaccination status of employees. Meanwhile, Sembcorp Industries has introduced an app that provides voluntary updates on a person\\'s vaccination status. The app, which was developed in-house, is also used to obtain online approval for essential facility visits. An Amazon spokesman said that the company\\'s employees and associates are generally not required to declare their vaccination status, except for staff members who are travelling to Singapore from overseas. The firm also provides a cash benefit to front-line employees and associates who are paid by the hour when they get their vaccination off-site. SHRI\\'s Ms Low and Mr Parekh from IHRP said employers can encourage immunisation by communicating the benefits to their staff as well as incentivising vaccination through means such as time off after getting the jabs and giving workers a care package. Mr Samir Bedi, Asean workforce advisory leader at EY, noted that it would not be surprising to see employers including vaccination as a pre-requisite in job descriptions in future, particularly for front-line positions that require face-to-face interactions. \"This not only protects employees and their families,but also ensures the public\\'s safety. Employees who travel for work may also need to comply with pre-travel vaccination travel regulations,\" he said. But companies must remain inclusive and consider the needs of individuals who may not be able to get vaccinated due to health reasons, Mr Bedi said. He added: \"This requires employers to continue with precautionary safe workplace measures while ensuring equal career opportunities for all.\" Join ST\\'s Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - There were 25 new Covid-19 cases, including 19 in the community, as at noon on Sunday (May 30), said the Ministry of Health (MOH). Six of the community cases are currently unlinked. The remaining 13 are linked to previous cases. Eleven had already been quarantined. There were also six imported cases who had been placed on stay-home notice on arrival in Singapore, said the ministry. Five are returning Singaporeans or permanent residents. There were no new cases in the workers' dormitories. The new cases take Singapore's total to 62,028. More details will be announced on Sunday night. Four children and a woman who are family members of an infected cleaning supervisor were among eight new coronavirus cases linked to the Hong Ye Group cluster on Saturday. The new cases from the same household are an eight-month-old girl, a one-year-old boy, two girls - aged seven and nine - who are pupils of Boon Lay Garden Primary School and a 32-year-old housewife. They are family members of a 30-year-old Singaporean man employed by Hong Ye Group as a cleaning supervisor at Changi Business Park. His infection was confirmed on May 23. The Hong Ye Group cluster now has 17 cases. MOH said on Saturday that the eight-month-old girl does not attend any childcare facility. The one-year-old boy attends Little Explorers Cove @ Boon Lay and was last at the centre last month. The two primary school pupils were last in school on May 18. The children and the housewife were identified as close contacts of the cleaning supervisor and were quarantined last Monday. MOH said the housewife developed a fever last Sunday but did not seek medical attention. The infant girl developed a fever the next day, the two primary school pupils had a fever last Wednesday, and the one-year-old boy had a fever last Thursday. Their symptoms were not reported. The five cases were tested for Covid-19 last Thursday during quarantine, and the results came back positive the next day. Their serology test results are pending. A third primary school pupil is also linked to the Hong Ye Group cluster. Aged 13, she is from Xinghua Primary School and was last in school on May 18. The remaining two new patients who were added to the cluster were a 58-year-old Singaporean housewife from the same household as another Hong Ye Group cleaner who had tested positive last Wednesday; and a 47-year-old Singaporean part-time cleaner who works at Abba Maintenance Services. Meanwhile, a 40-year-old Singaporean Rosyth School teacher was one of four unlinked community cases confirmed on Saturday. She was last in school on May 18. She had a blocked nose last Tuesday and a runny nose last Wednesday, and sought medical treatment at a general practitioner's clinic last Wednesday. She underwent both an antigen rapid test (ART) and a polymerase chain reaction test the next day, and was immediately isolated when her ART result came back positive, MOH said. She had a fever on the day she was isolated. She is fully vaccinated - she received her first jab on March 13 and her second on April 3. The other unlinked cases were a 49-year-old executive at Eng Soon Chair and Table Hire Service who had been working from home; a 33-year-old Malaysian kitchen assistant at Hua Zai Eating House; and a 23-year-old Malaysian cook at West Grill Station (Anchorvale). MOH also identified a new cluster on Saturday after linking cases to a 49-year-old permanent resident who is a manager at Success Consultancy, taking the total number of cases in this cluster to four. The three cases reported on Saturday that were added to the cluster are all Indian nationals. The three men sought medical treatment after developing symptoms, and their serology test results are pending. One of the men also works at Success Consultancy, while the other two are an IT engineer at AXA Go Singapore and an engineer at GlobalFoundries. There were 37 open clusters as at Saturday. Another Changi Prison Complex inmate was confirmed to have Covid-19 on Saturday, while two new patients were linked to the Jem and Westgate cluster, bringing the total number of cases in these clusters to 14 and 62 respectively. The clusters linked to Chevy's Bar and Bistro and McDonald's delivery riders each had one new case, bringing their total number of cases to five and 19 respectively. In all, MOH confirmed 23 community cases on Saturday. There were 10 imported cases who had been placed on stay-home notice on arrival in Singapore, MOH said. Five of the imported cases are Singaporeans or permanent residents. No new cases from within workers' dormitories were reported. Overall, the number of new cases in the community has fallen from 199 two weeks ago to 138 in the past week. Unlinked cases in the community have also decreased from 48 to 23 over the same period.

       " {'text': \"4 reasons the b1617 covid 19 virus strain spreads so easily Read 3 articles daily and stand to win ST rewards, including the ST News Tablet worth $398. Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - The B1617 Covid-19 variant has infiltrated over 50 countries, outcompeted other strains and continues to infect. It will also not be the last time the virus will mutate, experts cautioned. But what makes this strain, first discovered in India, so good at spreading? Dr Sebastian Maurer-Stroh, virus expert and executive director of the Bioinformatics Institute at the Agency for Science, Technology and Research, points out four features that the B1617 strain has in common with successful virus strains. He uses one of the three versions of the B1617 strain - the second B16172 version - to show what makes this virus different. B16172 has appeared to overtake B16171 in local cases as well as those reported globally. The third version, B16173, is rare. First, a little primer on coronavirus biology. What you see in the diagram belowis the spike protein of a coronavirus - the little spikes that give the virus its distinctive shape. The spike protein is a trimer - three subunits joined together. It is the complex shown in grey. The green and yellow complexes are two different antibodies that bind to the spike protein. The coloured circles represent the different mutations in B16172. Characteristic 1: The virus' mutations help it to bind more easily with the ACE2 receptor ACE2 is short for angiotensin converting enzyme 2, which is a receptor protein in the host cell. ACE2 receptors are found in various parts of the body, including respiratory airways, and are used as entry points by the Sars-CoV-2 virus. The Sars-CoV-2 virus gets inside a host cell through its surface spike protein. The spike protein and the receptors have a specific 3D configuration that enables them to bind to each other. The virus attaches only to cells that have these receptors. The spike protein attaches to an ACE2 receptor in the host cell before being activated by another enzyme. Now, let's take a closer look at one of the subunits on the spike protein to see how its mutations have helped. Scientists think the L452R mutation and - to a lesser extent the T478K mutation - makes it easier for the virus to attach itself to the receptor and thus get inside the cell. If binding to the receptor is easier, the virus can get inside the host cell more easily and infect more cells. But being more infectious does not mean it can make people more ill. A more transmissible strain most often does not have more symptoms or lead to a more severe form of the disease. Characteristic 2: Decreasing binding to antibodies T478K and certain other mutations - which are circled near the yellow antibody - probably make the virus less likely to stick to antibodies. In a full immune response, many types of antibodies work together. Though a decrease in antibody binding has yet to be proven for T478K, correlation was drawn based on existing data. The E484K mutation found in the B1351 and P1 variants is located in the same region as T478K - hence it is likely that there will be a similar effect. Even though one mutation could slightly reduce the protection derived from vaccines and prior infections, it is insufficient to remove their utility. Vaccination and natural immunity from prior infections are still very effective in reducing the chance of getting infected and spreading the disease, as well as protection against a severe form of the disease - even in the case of variants. Characteristic 3: A more stable spike protein The D614G mutation has been very successful in improving spike protein stability and is found in practically all strains of the virus. D614G results in the spike protein adopting a more open conformation, which gives it more surface area to interact with the ACE2 receptor, hence increasing its infectivity. A more stable spike protein can also mean more spike protein expressed on the virus surface, increasing its chances of infecting host cells. D614G has been linked to increased transmissibility and a higher viral load but not increased severity. Characteristic 4: Improving cleavage rates The spike protein needs to be cleaved into two units (called S1 and S2 units) to allow structural changes needed to enter into cells. The diagramshows the spike protein on the Sars-CoV-2 virus before cleavage and the right shows what it looks like after the S1 unit has dissociated. Mutations like P681R could potentially improve cleavage rates and hence increase infectivity. This has yet to be confirmed experimentally.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - Two more Covid-19 cases were linked to a barber shop in Bedok on Monday (June 7), bringing the total linked to the Atatcutz Singapore cluster to eight. The cluster was announced last Saturday. The earliest case detected in the cluster wasa 26-year-old Malaysian man who works as a delivery rider for Pizza Hut in Hougang Green. His infection was confirmed on June 1. Four barbers at the Bedok shop have been infected, including one who works part-time. The remaining four cases are either close contacts of or live in the same household as the barbers. Among those in the cluster so far, at least one personis believed to have been a customer at the shop. The Straits Times answers questions on the risk of infections at the hairdresser and other places where personal services are provided, such as nail salons. A: Experts had told The Straits Times previously that the risk of indoor transmission was much higher than outdoors, especially if ventilation is lacking and people are in close proximity. Associate Professor Hsu Li Yang, vice-dean of global health at the National University of Singapore\\'s Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, said the risk to customers and service providers at massage shops, hair and nail salons is probably in between that of restaurants and other retailers. For instance, many hairdressing salons and shops are small, fairly cramped spaces where the air exchange is relatively poor. \"Customers will have to be in this space for at least 10 minutes and usually far longer. Most hairdressers are in much closer contact with customers relative to other shop owners or assistants,\" he said. A: According to the latest guidelines issued by the authorities, for hairdressing services, all capes and towels must be changed after every service. All hairdressing equipment, such as scissors, combs and brushes, must be disinfected and sanitised after use by each customer. For beauty services in general, the guidelines say all operators must not serve food and drinks to customers, and should remove shared items such as magazines and newspapers. Employees must sanitise their hands before and after each customer\\'s treatment. Masks must be worn by customers and employees at all times. Services that require masks to be removed have been disallowed since May 16 in the current period of heightened alert until June 13, with the exception of medical or dental services. A: Avoid going to the hair salon when it is crowded. Where possible, make an appointment and do not linger at the shop premises before and after the hair service. They can also consider reducing the frequency of visits during this period where possible, said Prof Hsu, and minimise talking with the hairdresser and other customers. Dr Ling Li Min, an infectious diseases physician at Rophi Clinic, suggested that long sessions could be split into two separate sessions. Both staff and customers should keep their masks on at all times, she added. \"Customers should take spare masks, as they can easily get wet or dirty during the session.\" The Ministry of Health has advised that masks with at least 95 per cent bacterial filtration efficiency should be worn. Hair salons should try to ensure good ventilation where possible, such as keeping doors open, said Dr Ling. Join ST\\'s Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - Covid-19 self-test kits will be sold by pharmacists atGuardian, Unity and Watsons pharmacies from June 16, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) on Thursday (June 10). Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said during an update by the multi-ministry task force on Covid-19: \"As we want to resume more activities, we need to make testing fast, easy and accessible.\" Sales will be initially limited to 10 antigen rapid test (ART) kits per person to ensure there are adequate supplies for all. They will be made available at more retail locations progressively. Singapore\\'s director of medical services, Associate Professor Kenneth Mak, said: \"We will eventually allow test kits to be freely purchased as more ART test kit supplies are made available for retail sales.\" The ART kits produce results in less than 20 minutes, are simple to use and can be self-administered, MOH said. Prof Mak said: \"The ART self-test kits complement our overall surveillance strategy. \"These fast and easy-to-use tests allow us to detect infected cases more quickly, in particular among individuals who do not have acute respiratory infection symptoms, but are concerned that they may have been exposed to Covid-19.\" This might be for people who had been to a place that a confirmed case had visited, for instance. The four self-test kits that have been granted interim authorisation by the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) for sale to the public are the Abbott PanBio Covid-19 Antigen Self-Test, the Quidel QuickVue At-Home OTC Covid-19 Test, the SD Biosensor Sars-CoV-2 Antigen Self-Test Nasal, and the SD Biosensor Standard Q Covid-19 Ag Home Test. In response to media queries, Watsons Singapore said it will be retailing the Abbott and Quidel QuickVue test kits at all pharmacy stores in phase oneof the test kit roll-out. \"We would be keeping with MOH’s recommended guidelines on retail selling price, which will range from approximately $10 to $13 per test kit,\"it said. MOH said: \"Individuals who have a positive result for their ART self-test should immediately approach a Swab And Send Home public health preparedness clinic for a confirmatory polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. \"They are then required to self-isolate until they receive a negative PCR test result.\" Meanwhile, those who test negative on their self-test ART should still stay vigilant and adhere to prevailing safe management measures, MOH said. Individuals who have acute respiratory infection symptoms should also continue to visit a doctor for a full diagnosis and PCR test instead of relying on an ART self-test kit, it added. The HSA noted that ARTs have a lower sensitivity than PCR tests and a higher chance of false negative results. In general, ARTs can achieve a sensitivity of about 80 per cent for cases with higher viral loads and a specificity range of 97 per cent to 100 per cent, it added. Prof Mak said: \"Regular testing is key to our ability to reopen and will be part of our way of life. (It) allows us to detect and isolate cases in the community more quickly, and will allow more economic and social activities to continue, even as we detect cases and clusters. \"Testing also provides us with the greater assurance that our homes, retail places and workplaces are safe.\" More information on the ART kits will be made available through various media channels and the MOH website from June 16.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - A breath test that can accurately detect Covid-19 in two minutes received provisional authorisation from Singapore’s Health Sciences Authority (HSA) on May 27, the authority said on its website on Friday (June 11). This is the second such system to receive the HSA's provisional authorisation. Developed by local medical technology firm Silver Factory Technology, the TracieX breathalyserhas a sensitivity of 95 per cent and a specificity of 97.8 per cent, the HSA said in an update on Friday. Sensitivity refers to a test’s ability to identify those infected as positive, while specificity refers to a test’s ability to correctly identify those not infected as negative. Silver Factory was founded in January last year as a spin-off from Nanyang Technological University.Its test analyses the human breath composition using a technique known as Raman spectroscopy. These fast tests will facilitate safe travel arrangements and screenings at large-scale events. Silver Factory’s breathalysers will cost around US$20 (S$27) each. The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) and Changi Airport Group (CAG) said on Friday that some airport workers have begun using disposable TracieX breathalysers to test for Covid-19 as part of a small-scale pilot. This new, non-invasive test will gradually be scaled up to replace antigen rapid tests (ARTs) for more airport workers, CAAS and CAG said it a joint statement. Earlier onMay 17, a breath test developed by Breathonix, a spin-off from the National University of Singapore, alsoreceived the HSA's approval - the first in the country to do so. Breathonix’s breathalysers detect specific volatile organic compounds in human breath samples using a technique called mass spectrometry. Its tests have a sensitivity of 85.3 per cent and specificity of 97 per cent. Breathonix has since conducted a few thousand tests for its pilot deployment at Tuas Checkpoint. Each test was completed in 40 to 60 seconds. “Companies are required to collect relevant accuracy and safety data and monitor the real-world use of their tests. HSA also requires additional data from ongoing clinical studies to be submitted post-approval for HSA to ensure the continued safety and efficacy of these tests,” the HSA said.

She was confirmed to be infected with the coronavirus on May 17 when she was warded at Changi General Hospital for an unrelated medical condition, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Sunday. The patient had not been vaccinated against the virus, and had a history of cancer, hypertension and hypothyroidism. Changi General Hospital has contactedher family and is extending assistance to them, said MOH. Meanwhile, five of the 19 community cases on Sunday were linked to a new cluster at NTUC Foodfare at 308 Anchorvale Road. MOH said it is investigating cases of Covid-19 infection among people who work there. \"Our epidemiological investigations have found that there is likely ongoing transmission at the coffee shop,\" said the ministry. The coffee shop was closed to members of the public on Sunday and will reopen two weeks later, on June 13, to break any potential chain of transmission and allow for deep cleaning of the premises, said MOH. The ministry will also offer free Covid-19 testing for members of the public who visited 308 Anchorvale Road from May 13 to May 30 to \"pre-emptively mitigate potential risk of wider, undetected community transmission\". All visitors to 308 Anchorvale Road within that timeframe are advised to monitor their health closely for two weeks from thedate of their visit, said the ministry, which encouraged them to visit a regional screening centre or Swab and Send HomePublic Health Preparedness Clinic for a free Covid-19 test. There are now a total of seven cases in the cluster. A 21-year-old Vietnamese man who works as a kitchen assistant at Hua Zai HK Style Roasted Delight Rice Noodle at 308 Anchorvale Road is among the five new cases linked to the cluster on Sunday. He is a household contact of several other cases in the cluster. He was quarantined on Saturday (May 29) and developed a cough on the same day. He was tested for Covid-19 the next day, and his result came back positive on the same day. His serology test result is pending.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - Do-it-yourself Covid-19 test kits will be a useful tool in Singapore\\'s arsenal to fight the coronavirus as these are quick and convenient to use, said experts on Wednesday (June 2). But they also flagged potential areas of concern like the under-declaring of results, with one expert suggesting that the authorities regulate such kits and integrate them into government health systems. These kits, which are already in use in places such as South Korea, the United States and Europe, will be available at pharmacies in Singapore soon, said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Monday. He added that they will be simple to use and not as uncomfortable as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. DIY tests work like the antigen rapid tests (ART), which are used heavily for pre-event testing. They return results in about 30 minutes, but are less accurate than a PCR test which usually takes a day or two to process. The Health Ministry told The Straits Times it is currently in discussion with relevant agencies and partners to bring in over-the-counter ART kits, and will provide more information when ready. Infectious diseases expert Paul Tambyah, who is president of the Asia-Pacific Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infection, said these test kits are useful because they can be used at home or if there is a need to travel somewhere in an emergency and a regular PCR test or ART cannot be done. \"These are essentially stripped-down ART tests... Many US airlines accept home test results. Companies can also get their employees to do them on a regular basis until vaccinations are completed,\" he said. Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious diseases specialist from the Rophi Clinic, said the test will be simple to administer - almost like a pregnancy test kit. \"It is much cheaper, at a cost price of $15 to $20 per day. It takes away the complexity of testing, giving the power to the consumers,\" he added. In comparison, a PCR test costs roughly between $150 and$200, while an ART costs as low as $10. The convenience these kits offer makes them good for the likes of businesses whichwant to reassure their customers and high-risk workers who wish to give their families peace of mind, said Dr Ling Li Min, an infectious diseases physician from Rophi Clinic. But there are several risks to DIY kits, including the possibility that they could produce false results if administered incorrectly. Dr Ling highlighted the risk of showing false negatives. \"This means infected people may think they are virus-free, especially if they have yet to have symptoms,\" she said, adding they could be spreading the disease unknowingly. The experts agreed that the results of such tests have to be carefully interpreted. ProfessorTambyah said they could also show a false positive, so a confirmatory PCR test - the gold standard in Covid-19 testing -is needed to confirm a diagnosis. They also noted that not declaring a positive DIY test result could be dangerous, given how it would mean that infectious people could be spreading the disease. ProfTambyah suggested regulating the sale of such kits in pharmacies, and integrating them into Singapore\\'s national gateway to citizens\\' medical records, prescriptions and clinic appointments. \"The loop could be closed between purchase of a kit and report of the results before the kit expires,\" he said. In India, users of the CoviSelf DIY test kit have to download an app to use the kit. This app is synced with the results of the test, which are directly fed into a report on the Indian Council of Medical Research\\'s portal. On the point that some might fear reporting their positive test result for fear of discrimination or a reluctance to be admitted to the hospital, Dr Leong said the stigma surrounding Covid-19 should be addressed to encourage people to seek medical help if needed. He and ProfTambyah drew parallels to how some patients with the human immuno-deficiency virus might hide the status of their health. \"There is a need to clear the stigma. Being positive for Covid-19 does not mean anything, but some people might face the stigma,\" said Dr Leong. The test does not replace seeking medical attention if one is ill, said the experts, who stressed that anyone who is ill or is displaying symptoms of the disease should see a doctor.

       " {'text': 'some neutralising antibodies may worsen covid 19 disease scientists Read 3 articles daily and stand to win ST rewards, including the ST News Tablet worth $398. Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - Certain types of Covid-19 neutralising antibodies - which prevent the Sars-CoV-2 virus from infecting a person\\'s cells - may end up worsening the disease, scientists have found. When the Sars-CoV-2 virus attacks the body, its spike protein binds to a receptor enzyme known as ACE2 in the host cell and in some instances, causes the viral cell and the host cell membranes to fuse. This is known as syncytia, and it has been linked to lung tissue damage in severe Covid-19 cases, when the cell fusion occurs inside the airways. Antibodies block this interaction between the ACE2 receptor and the Sars-CoV-2 virus, and are often in emergency use for early Covid-19 treatment. Antibodies can be naturally produced by the body after infection, or they can be created in a laboratory. These are known as monoclonal antibodies. A team of researchers from the Agency forScience, Technology and Research (A*Star), in collaboration with the QBI Coronavirus Research Group at the University of California, San Francisco, University of Lyon, and DSO National Laboratories, discovered that some neutralising antibodies inhibit syncytia, while others drastically enhance it. Their study findings were published in the scientific journal Cell in April. Three antibodies, known as 5A6, 2H4 and 3D11 were selected from a pool of 30 billion synthetic human antibodies using a method known as biopanning. This entails using a viral spike protein as a \"bait\" to fish out the relevant antibodies that bind to it, said Dr Wang Cheng-I, senior principal investigator at A*Star\\'s Singapore Immunology Network and one of the authors of the study. The study found that the 5A6 antibody was able to block interactions between the viral spike protein and ACE2 and inhibit syncytia formation, making it a viable candidate for Covid-19 treatment. Dr Wang said that his team is now actively developing the antibody into a Covid-19 therapeutic. On the other hand, the 3D11 antibody was found to enhance syncytia, whereas the 2H4 antibody was found to have no significant effect on cell-to-cell fusion. While a lot more work has to be done to understand its implications, the fact that both types of antibodies - one that inhibits syncytia and one that enhances it - can be found in both infected and vaccinated individuals has \"profound implications\" on how Covid-19 treatments should be designed, said Dr Wang. This is especially important given the \"ever-mutating nature\" of the Sars-CoV-2 virus, he added. Thus, pharmaceutical companies creating antibodies for Covid-19 treatment should also test their antibodies for syncytia to avoid worsening Covid-19, said Dr Wang. Local biotech firm Tychan is among the companies developing monoclonal antibodies for treatment against Covid-29. Since last December, 1,305 Covid-19 patients have taken part in the final phase of clinical trials for its immune system protein TY027. Asked if the research findings will be taken into consideration by the company for its clinical trials, Professor Ooi Eng Eong, who is its co-founder, said the paper is interesting, but laboratory observations do not directly correlate with clinical outcome. He added that the trial is still ongoing without any safety concerns. If the clinical trials are successful, the antibody will be submitted for review by the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) and other regulatory agencies as a new drug. In June last year, DSO National Laboratories had found five neutralising antibodies that could help the body fight against Covid-19. Clinical trials were then set to begin for the most promising of the five - AODO1 once approval has been obtained from HSA. When asked if human trials have commenced and if the antibodies will be tested for syncytia, the DSO spokesman said more updates will be given later.

       " {'text': '24 people vaccinated at home under ongoing pilot project Read 3 articles daily and stand to win ST rewards, including the ST News Tablet worth $398. Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - Mr K.S. Toh, 68, suffered a stroke four years ago that resulted in him having to rely on a wheelchair to move around. Despite wanting to get vaccinated against Covid-19, he found it difficult to travel to the nearest vaccination centre by himself as he lives alone in a three-room flat in Yishun. Mr Toh has since discovered through Touch Community Services that he can receive the vaccine at home. He is a client of its Touch Home Care service. As part of the nationwide vaccination roll-out, the Ministry of Health (MOH) called for a tender on May 19 to provide Covid-19 vaccinations to people who are unable to leave their house, including seniors like Mr Toh. Since May 10, a pilot project for home vaccination teams has been under way, with 24 individuals getting their Covid-19 vaccinations at home as at last Wednesday (May 26), MOH told The Straits Times. Each home vaccination team consists of a doctor and a nurse who carry the necessary medical supplies and equipment. Meanwhile, mobile vaccination teams comprising one doctor, four nurses and three administrators have been deployed islandwide to make vaccinations more accessible. As at last Wednesday, 27,019 individuals have used this service. Mobile vaccination teams have also been deployed at Bukit Panjang Community Club (CC), MacPherson CC and various community centres. However, even travelling to the nearest CC may be difficult for seniors who are unable to leave their home, such as Ms Mary Teo, 74, who is diabetic, has Parkinson\\'s disease and is bedridden. Her caregiver, foreign domestic worker Padua Mae Zate, 37, used to be able to move Ms Teo to a wheelchair and take her out to get some air. But ever since Ms Zate underwent fibroid removal surgery, the combined weight of Ms Teo and her wheelchair is now too heavy for the helper to negotiate down the two steps to the corridor. The Agency for Integrated Care (AIC), which is working with MOH to roll out the home vaccination teams, said it will be organising webinars to help home-care providers identify and encourage eligible clients to register for home vaccination. NTUC Health said that to date, 60 of its home-care clients, aged between 50 and 80, have expressed interest in receiving vaccinations. NTUC Health then liaises with MOH to arrange an appointment for those who are interested. Lions Befrienders chairman Anthony Tay said that for home vaccinations, its staff - who include registered nurses - have been assessing the health conditions of seniors eligible for the jab and registering those eligible with AIC. Of the 7,600 seniors that Lions Befrienders serves, around 228 aged between 60 and 95 are receiving home personal care. \"Many seniors who have pre-existing conditions may self-exclude themselves from taking the vaccine because they think they are not eligible,\" said Mr Tay. Mr Julian Koo, chief executive of home and mobile health company Jaga-Me, which is participating in MOH\\'s tender, said some seniors may also not have the cognitive ability to relate their health conditions to a medical provider. Other healthcare providers that The Straits Times spoke to, such as Doctor Anywhere, Speedoc and Sata CommHealth, said people who are unable to leave their home may also be immuno-compromised or have physical disabilities. \"This is an opportunity to go through with a fine-tooth comb, to help these patients who may have otherwise fallen through the cracks,\" said Mr Koo. As at the middle of this month, about 71 per cent of eligible senior citizens aged 60 and above had been vaccinated or had booked appointments for their shots.

       " {'text': 'pregnant women should get jab to protect themselves and baby experts Read 3 articles daily and stand to win ST rewards, including the ST News Tablet worth $398. Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - Pregnant and breastfeeding women should get vaccinated to protect themselves and their babies from Covid-19, as real-world data has shown that this is not only safe but is also beneficial to both mother and child, said specialists here. With the emergence of new Covid-19 variants and a resurgence of community-transmitted cases, there is reason to vaccinate pregnant women, who are at higher risk of developing complications from Covid-19 than non-pregnant women, they added. Vaccination also protects the baby, said the College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists Singapore (COGS) and the Obstetrical andGynaecological Society of Singapore (OGSS) on Thursday (June 3). Studies in other countries have shown that pregnant women who get Covid-19 are more likely to require intensive care or invasive ventilation, such as a breathing tube inserted into the windpipe, said Dr Lim Min Yu, president of OGSS. This puts the baby at higher risk of prematurebirth and stillbirth, and hemay also need intensive care. \"It\\'s for these reasons that we feel it is imperative to encourage our pregnant women to be vaccinated,\" Dr Lim said. Moreover, antibodies that the women produce after vaccination are transferred to the babies before birth, as well as to breast milk. This offers protection to the babies, though the extent and duration of this protection is unclear at this stage, he said. COGS and OGSS said the vaccines are safe for breastfeeding mothers, with none of the vaccine components passing into the breast milk. They added that the vaccines are also safe for women who are planning to conceive. COGS and OGSS issued a joint advisory and guidelines on Thursday, two days after the authorities here said it was safe for pregnant or breastfeeding women to get vaccinated. Pregnant women who are older, overweight or obese, or who have conditions such as diabetes or high blood pressure, are at an increased risk of developing serious complications, the advisory said. Pregnant women will be able to register and book a vaccination appointment from June 4 if they are part of the population group eligible for vaccination. Adults aged 40 to 44 can now register for their Covid-19 jabs. Those aged 45 and above were included in previous phases of the national vaccination drive. Pregnant women were among those advised previously to hold off on receiving the shots, as large-scale clinical trials on the Covid-19 mRNA vaccines have not involved such volunteers. COGS and OGSS said a recent study of about 4,000 women in the United States \"demonstrated safety of the mRNA Covid-19 vaccines (Pfizer and Moderna), with no increased risks of adverse pregnancy outcomes nor any obvious adverse events\". Dr Lim said that, currently, the main published data available on Covid-19 vaccines and pregnancy is on the two mRNA vaccines that are currently being used here, and that there is no safety data yet for the use of the Sinovac inactivated vaccine on pregnant women. It is not clear why pregnant women are more prone to becoming severely ill with Covid-19. Dr Lim said it could be due to the changes that women experience in pregnancy, such as increased heart rate and increased oxygen consumption. For instance, their lung capacity gets affected by a growing uterus, their immune system also changes and there is an increased risk of developing blood clots. He said that pregnant women can discuss the vaccination with their doctor. \"It\\'s mainly to ascertain that they don\\'t have any of the risk factors that would preclude them from vaccination, but those risk factors are actually the same as for the general population.\" Get the ST Smart Parenting newsletter for expert advice.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - Businesses are gearing up to welcome more customers, with the easing of Covid-19 restrictions from Monday (June 14), which includes an increase in the cap on social group sizes from two to five. Some are looking forward to welcoming more families for the remainder of the June school holidays. The Ministry of Health said last week that Singapore will gradually reopen in two steps, after earlier strict measures that were put in place to curb a worrying spike in Covid-19 cases. The first step of reopening on Monday will see operating capacity limits for attractions, cruises, museums and public libraries go up from 25 per cent to 50 per cent. The size limits for events such as movie screenings, worship services and marriage solemnisations will also be increased. Pre-event testing will be required for events with more than 50 attendees. In the second step, slated to take place from next Monday, dining in for groups of up to five may be allowed. Orchard Hotel Singapore said it saw a 40 per cent increase in website traffic following the Government\\'s announcement last Thursday on the easing of measures. Mr Greg Allan, vice-president of South-east Asia operations for Millennium Hotels and Resorts, which runs Orchard Hotel, said: \"With two weeks left to the school holiday, many families are keen to book staycations so the lifting of precautionary measures is certainly a welcome move.\" The hotel has worked with vendors to launch activities targeted at families, he added. These include dim sum cooking classes and virtual reality game experiences. SneakPeek Singapore, which organises walking, hiking and kayaking tours, said it is preparing for larger groups, such as readying more kayaks. It added: \"Operationally, it will be much easier, less taxing, and less logistically complex to operate tours with sub-groups of five people instead of two. \"During phase two (heightened alert), there was little confidence to make bookings, even for after June 13, but now people are... booking tours for dates that are further away.\" Other organisations such as Wildlife Reserves Singapore and Dream Cruises have said they will increase their maximum capacity in line with what is allowed. The loosened restrictions will also benefit the likes of Kitten Sanctuary Singapore, a non-profit animal welfare group for cats. Executive director Jessica Seet said the group will now be able to accept more visitors and allow more volunteers to help out. \"Visitors are our lifeline to cover (the various) costs for rescued cats and kittens... so the easing of restrictions helps us to stay afloat,\" said Ms Seet. The Islamic Religious Council of Singapore said on Saturday that four mosques will pilot the use of an extra zone in order to offer more spaces for Friday prayers on June 25. In a Facebook post on Sunday evening, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong thanked the public for observing the tightened measures this past month. \"If all goes well, we should be able to open up further by next week,\" he said. \"In the new normal, such disruptions will happen from time to time, but we can still carry on with our lives.\" Join ST\\'s Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - A variety of Covid-19 tests - with the latest being over-the-counter test kits - are now under Singapore’s belt, allowing fast, extensive, easy and accurate tests to be conducted as the nation raises its game to fight the virus. Here's a look at the different tests. Swab test from the nose or back of throat, or from sputum. Looks for genetic sequences of Covid-19. Cost: Over $150 to $200 for pre-departure testing. If you have been advised by your doctor to take a swab test, this will be free. Time taken: A few hours. Ease of use:Requires the use of specialised lab machines. Accuracy:Gold standard for testing. Sensitivity rate (ability to detect those who are positive): more than 93 per cent. Other details:Very uncomfortable. An average of over 55,000 PCR and ART tests were carried out each day in the second half of May. Some involve using a nasal swab from the lower part of the nose. Looks for proteins on the surface of the virus called antigens. Cost:As low as $10. Time taken:20 to 30 minutes. Ease of use: Deployment is very flexible because it is a handheld device and can be done en masse with many people being swabbed at the same time. ARTs have been rolled out to almost all the public health preparedness clinics that are providing the “swab and send home” service and all polyclinics.To expand testing capacity, the Government is hoping to deploy them to private GPs as well. Accuracy:Not as accurate as PCR tests, but able to pick up infections early.Sensitivity rate: 82 per cent. Other details:Those with acute respiratory symptoms are required to take an ART test on top of a PCR testto allow for faster detection of cases. Used heavily for pre-event testing. No swabbing; just blowing into a mouthpiece or cartridge. Cost:Estimated to bearound $25. Time taken:Under two minutes. Ease of use:Involves some equipment. Accuracy:More than 90 per cent of the accuracy of a PCR test. Other details: The Breathonix breathalyser is now used at the Causeway. Like pregnancy kits, these could be ART tests which are purchased from pharmacies and administered at home. Cost:Price to be confirmed. Time taken:ART usually takes 20 to 30 minutes. Ease of use:Ease of use to be confirmed. Accuracy:ART tests typically have a sensitivity rate of 82 per cent. Other details:People who are worried about Covid-19 and wish to put their mind at ease, such as front-line workers who may wish to test themselves daily. Will be simple to use and not so uncomfortable. Detects the presence of the virus at a location. This can then be followed up with clinical tests. Frequency of sample collection varies from site to site and depends on the purpose of surveillance. Other details:Locations islandwide that have had their wastewater surveyed include the four water reclamation plants, workers' dormitories, nursing homes and hostels. One PCR test on a group of suspected cases.If the pooled test yields a positive result, all the people in the group will be tested individually to fish out the Covid-19 case. Other details:Usually conducted in dormitories to get a sense of the prevalence rate of Covid-19 there. Join ST's Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - The side effects that adolescents may experience after receiving the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against Covid-19 are similar to those experienced by adults and should generally resolve after a few days, experts have said. These side effects include pain and redness over the injection site, muscle aches, fatigue and fever. According to a recent United States clinical trial in which 1,131 children aged between 12 and 15 received the Pfizer vaccine, the side effects settled within one to three days, said Associate Professor Hsu Li Yang, vice-dean of global health at the National University of Singapore\\'s Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health. This is similar to what adults experience as well. \"The safety profile was excellent, and there was only one child with a severe enough reaction that the second dose was not administered,\" said Prof Hsu, commenting on the results of the clinical trial. That child had a fever of more than 40 deg C. These comments come after a nationwide vaccination exercise for more than 400,000 students kicked off on Thursday (June 3), following more cases of schoolchildren getting infected in the recent Covid-19 outbreak. The Health Sciences Authority on May 18 extended its authorisation for those in the 12 to 15 age group to receive the Pfizer vaccine. It was previously approved here only for those aged 16 and older. While those aged 18 to 55 in Pfizer\\'s trials reported experiencing side effects such as fever and fatigue more frequently than those aged 56 and above, those younger than 18 are unlikely to experience more side effects than those in the 18 to 55 age group, added Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious diseases specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. Singapore’sdirector of medical services Kenneth Mak also said earlier this week that children generally have a stronger immune system compared withadults, and they may experience a slightly higher incidence of minor effects such as fever, compared with adults. This is common for children for all types of vaccine they receive, he added. Over the next two weeks, invitations to book slots for vaccine appointments will be progressively extended to other full-time students, including those in special education schools. Dr Leong said that it was safe for adolescents with special needs like autism to be vaccinated. Currently, the US, Canadaand the European Union\\'s drug watchdog have already authorised Pfizer for adolescents. More than 600,000 12- to 15-year-olds in the US have received the shot.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - Six of the 10 workers linked to a chain of transmissions involving roast meat chain Hua Zai were living together and had worked in two different outlets, prompting experts to say that it is highly likely for cross-infections to occur when masks come off - at rest areas and in shared accommodation. This comes after concerns that kitchens could be a weak link in Singapore\\'s battle against Covid-19, although amid the pandemic, all workers involved in the preparation of food and drinks have been required to wear masks and gloves. But these protective items may come off at rest areas or places where staff eat, making transmission of the coronavirus in these places also possible, said president of the Asia-Pacific Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infection Paul Tambyah. Many local eateries also have very small rest areas, which could lead to crowding during breaks. \"The key is to ensure all staff are vaccinated,\" Prof Tambyah said. \"While waiting for this to happen, adequate spacious rest and dining space should be provided, hand hygiene equipment should be available and staff should be able to seek medical attention which might include three to five days of medical leave without fear of financial penalty.\" Safe management measures at food and beverage outlets have been tightened from May 16 to June 13, with mealtimes for employees staggered. Staff also have to dine alone and put on their masks as soon as they have finished eating or drinking. But recent outbreaks - which have seen food delivery riders testing positive for Covid-19 and fast-food chain Pizza Hut having to deep-clean three of its outlets, after four staff members at its Punggol Plaza outlet and a delivery rider at its Havelock II outlet caught the virus - have raised concerns about whether eateries are a hotbed for infections. In Hua Zai\\'s case, all 26 of its outlets were shuttered after seven of its staff - at the NTUC Foodfare outlet at 308 Anchorvale Road, and two other Hua Zai outlets at 476D Upper Serangoon View and Hougang Street 51 - tested positive for Covid-19 in thespan of four days. The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Wednesday (June 2) said closing the outlets was to enable deep cleaning of Hua Zai\\'s premises and break any potential chains of transmission. It added in a release on Wednesday night that the Anchorvale Road NTUC Foodfare cluster, where the first Hua Zai case worked, now has a 10th case but did not specify which stall she worked in. Other than the seven Hua Zai staff members, two others had worked in other stalls at the same foodcourt. Associate Professor Alex Cook of the National University of Singapore\\'s Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health said good hand hygiene and consistent mask wearing are important in small spaces to minimise risks, adding that operators should also try to increase ventilation into the kitchen. Research fellow at the NUS Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health Rayner Tan said there is a higher risk of mutual infection in small spaces like food stalls, adding that owners should not deploy staff from one outlet to another. In Hua Zai\\'s case, a worker who tested positive had worked at both the Anchorvale and Upper Serangoon outlets. But Prof Cook also noted that, with the Malaysian and Vietnamese staff living in such close proximity and sharing amenities like the toilet and kitchen, household transmission may be a quite likely route of infection in this case. \"We do see quite a number of household clusters, and while we can require mask wearing at work, it\\'s not feasible to impose safeguards within households. MOH had said on Monday that with immediate effect, all household members of persons under quarantine are to self-isolate at home and minimise their social interactions until the person under quarantine tests negative in a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, in part due to the high transmission rates of newer variants. All housemates of the first patient infected in the Hua Zai household who subsequently tested positive were already in quarantine when their results came back. Prof Cook reminded the public that the risk of them catching the virus when buying food is very low, given that dining-in is no longer allowed now. He also added of the risk of transmission through cooked food, especially if protocol like wearing gloves is followed: \"I\\'m sure it\\'s possible but the question should be how probable it is. With good hygiene and mask wearing this risk should be extraordinarily low. The Singapore Food Agency had previously said that the risk of infections of Covid-19 due to contact with contaminated surfaces of food and food packaging is \"very low\", and that there is no evidence for such spread. Prof Cook cautioned against an overreaction as the number of clusters linked to food and beverage establishments remain relatively uncommon, adding: \"The vast majority of us are now working from home, or have been on home-based learning. It\\'s precisely the workers who cannot work from home who face the greatest risk of infection.\" \"These are the front-line workers like restaurant staff, hawkers, security guards and cleaners, among whom we have seen more cases lately.\" As Singapore remains on heightened alert, food delivery and takeaway purchases have increased. While the risk of the virus being passed from food handlers to consumers is low if proper hygiene is followed, a contact-free delivery service will minimise unnecessary contact between them, asorders are placed on doorsteps and purchases paid without cash transactions. According to prevailing MOH and Singapore Food Agency regulations, food handlers should not be in direct contact with the food at all times, and should instead wear gloves and be properly masked up. They should wash their hands before handling food, and take time off work if they feel unwell or know of anyone they were in close contact with who had the virus. Stall owners should ensure there are not too many workers in a single stall, so that some safe distancing can be maintained. Again, when in the stall, they should be masked up. Some outlets already practise contactless pickup for delivery riders, where food handlers would leave the packed food order at the pickup point without interacting with the delivery rider. While customers and delivery staff are allowed to enter food and beverage establishments for takeaway or delivery, they must leave the premises once they have picked up their orders. Delivery riders should also practise proper hand hygiene and be properly masked, infectious disease specialists said.

       " {'text': \"sinovac approved under special access route moh Read 3 articles daily and stand to win ST rewards, including the ST News Tablet worth $398. Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - Sinovac's Covid-19 vaccine will be allowed under the Special Access Route (SAR), said the Ministry of Health (MOH) on Wednesday (June 2). This follows the announcement by the World Health Organisation (WHO) on Tuesday that it had approved the shot under its Emergency Use Listing. In response to queries from The Straits Times, MOH said that given this latest development, the Sinovac product would be allowed under the SAR. However, since the China-made vaccine is not part of the national programme, those who choose to receive it will not be eligible for the Vaccine Injury Financial Assistance Programme (Vifap) should they develop any adverse reactions. MOH said it will release more details in the coming days on how private healthcare institutions can apply to be licensed providers. It added that it is working out details on pricing, informed consent process and safety of the patients who prefer to be administered with Sinovac's shot. Health Minister Ong Ye Kung had said on Monday that licensed healthcare institutions can apply to MOH to draw on Singapore's existing stock of 200,000 doses of the vaccine, which weredelivered earlier this year. However, MOH clarified on Wednesday that this is still a possibility that is being assessed. The ministry added that as more international and local evidence and data becomeavailable, the Expert Committee on Covid-19 vaccination is also reviewing current restrictions to allow people with known history of anaphylaxis to be inoculated with the two mRNA vaccines currently approved for use here – those by Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech. Both use messenger RNA to give instructions to the body’s cells to produce a harmless piece of the spike protein found on the surface of the coronavirus that causes Covid-19. This allows the body to protect itself from the disease. In contrast, Sinovac uses an inactivated form of the coronavirus to teach the body how to protect itself from Covid-19. Some private healthcare providers that ST spoke to were keen on offering vaccines under the SAR. Dr Tan Teck Jack, chief executive officer of Northeast Medical Group, said his chain of clinics intends to offer such vaccines to help get the whole population inoculated as quickly as possible. “We will be grateful if the Ministry of Health gives us some guidance. But we can also deal directly with the local representatives of any pharmaceutical company as required,” he added. He said although he did not know the price of the vaccines at the moment, his group aims to keep the cost affordable for patients. “As this is part of a national initiative with a broader objective, it will not be profit-driven,” he added, pointing out that the vaccination would probably be done on an appointment-only basis so as to avoid crowding. Dr Raymond Ong, a senior doctor with telemedicine service provider Doctor Anywhere, said aside from aiming to offer the Sinovac vaccine at its clinics, the group also hopes to incorporate it into its mobile medicine service and bring the drug to peoples’ doorsteps. “We understand that some people may not be able to leave their homes to get vaccinated,” he explained, adding that this move would depend on approval from the authorities. Dr Seow En Hao, founder of EH Medical,said there is interest on the ground for Sinovac. “These may be patients who are not allowed to take mRNA vaccines due to medical reasons or who chose not to take due to the fear of side effects from the current available vaccines,” he added. Some want the Sinovac vaccine as they want to travel to China“since China currently recognises only vaccinations done with its vaccines”, he said. He added that he is currently waiting for further instructions and approval from MOH before deciding whether to offer such vaccines. Dr Khor Chin Kee, chief executive of Healthway Medical which operates 53 general practitioner (GP) clinics here, said the group was still evaluating the various alternative vaccines under the SAR, including Sinovac’s. Raffles Medical Group, which also has 53 GP clinics here, said it was waiting for instructions from MOH and evaluating Monday’s announcement on the SAR. Thomson Medical and Fullerton Health echoed this position. For some members of the public, the announcement came a few days too late. Retiree Goh Lam Woo, 83, had been waiting for months to take the Sinovac vaccine. But with the pandemic worsening, he decided to get the Pfizer-BioNTech one instead last week while accompanying his wife, who was also getting jabbed. “I feel a little bit frustrated,” he said of Tuesday’s approval of the vaccine by the WHO. He added that he had been reluctant take mRNA vaccines as they are a “new product”, and would have preferred instead to take Sinovac’s shot as he considers it a “true vaccine”, similar to the kind used against flu, measles or polio. “(Pfizer-BioNTech) can’t tell you what the effects (of their vaccine) are one year down the road; what it’s going to do to your organs,” he said. Others were not as enthused by the prospect of taking Sinovac’s shot. Ms Spring Victoria Zaccheus said she is unlikely to opt for it as the reported efficacy rate is lower than thoseof the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. “I don’t feel safe taking it,” said the 24-year-old student. Although she has drug allergies that can cause “very bad swelling” around her eyes and may risk such a reaction to the mRNA vaccines, she added: “I would rather take the risk and take the Pfizer vaccination if possible, but wait there for an hour instead of just 30 minutes, in case anything were to happen.” Retiree Madam Toh, 80, has been unable to take the mRNA vaccines due to her history of anaphylaxis. Some experts have said that certain nanoparticles in the mRNA vaccines may be the cause of allergic reactions to them. But while Sinovac’s vaccine may not contain such nanoparticles, Madam Toh is still reluctant to receive it. “They have not really found out what allergies may be triggered as a reaction to Sinovac’s vaccine. I suspect the emergency acceptance may have been a bit rushed because of the worldwide need for vaccines,” she said. She plans to wait a little longer and ask her doctor about the vaccine at her next medical check-up. “I just have to be very careful in the meantime,” she added.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - In what is likely the largest swabbing exercise here involving housing blocks, mandatory tests are under way for residents of Block 506 Hougang Avenue8, as well as staff of shops in seven neighbouring blocks. Voluntary tests are also being offered to those living in these seven blocksafter the Ministry of Health (MOH) linked 13 cases so far to Block 506. A similar swabbing exercise earlier this week at Block 501 and Block 507 Hougang Avenue 8, as well as Block 745 Yishun Street 72, saw more than 1,000 residents and visitors tested, with four people returning positive tests for Covid-19. Experts told The Straits Times on Friday (June 4) that such aggressive testing is likely to be part of the \"new normal\", with the authorities keen to detect and ring-fence cases quickly. Professor Teo Yik Ying, dean of the National University of Singapore\\'s Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, said that given the Block 506 cluster, it is possible that the spread has extended beyond the building. \"This is especially since most people are working from home by default now, and they are more likely to be moving about their residential neighbourhoods more than usual,\" he added. \"The ring-fencing testing is likely to be the norm moving forward, in part because the Delta variant that is circulating in the community now is much more transmissible, and active case finding will help to minimise the extent of any onward transmissions by infected cases.\" Testing is one of three strategies, on top of contact tracing and vaccinations, to help the nation battle Covid-19 in the face of new, more contagious variants. MOH had said on Thursday night that Covid-19 viral fragments were detected in wastewater samples collected from some blocks. Mandatory testing, it added, seeks to detect cases who were still incubating the virus in the first round of testing, conducted on May 21 and 22, and to prevent spread in the community. Said Prof Teo: \"Wastewater testing will pick up fragments of the Sars-CoV-2 virus if any of the residents in the housing block is infected. So this is a way of performing community surveillance.\" He added that mandatory testing is a form of active case finding. Experts have noted the more aggressive approach in testing compared with last year. For example, after a student at Victoria Junior College tested positive for Covid-19, the Education Ministry last month quarantined 95 students and eight staff. About 2,200 students, staff, vendors and visitors had to also undergo swab tests as a precautionary measure. And on Monday, MINDSville @Napiri home tested 255 residents and staff of the home after a 37-year-old female resident tested positive. But some residents of Block 506 Hougang Avenue 8 had mixed feelings when they received notifications on Thursday informing them of mandatory testing for the second time in two weeks. Said a 37-year-old resident who gave his name only as Mr Ang: \"The situation looks bad if we\\'re getting tested so often, but I\\'m also appreciative of the steps that the authorities are taking to stop the virus\\' spread.\" This time, residents of Block 506 were not the only ones in queue. In fact, when the mandatory testing exercise began for them at 9am on Friday, the block\\'s residents were outnumbered by staff of shops in seven surrounding blocks. Free voluntary tests are being offered to residents of the seven blocks between Friday and June 17. They are - Block 511 Hougang Avenue 10; Blocks 681, 683 and 684 Hougang Avenue 8; Block 682 Hougang Avenue 4; and Blocks 685 and 698 Hougang Street 61. The first case in the Block 506 cluster is a 57-year-old Malaysian woman who tested positive on May 15. Other than the 13 cases in the block, MOH had earlier reported that three cases linked to the Changi Airport Terminal 3 cluster were also residents of Block 506. Meanwhile, a McDonald\\'s outlet in Block 684 was closed on May 27 after a rider who made deliveries from the outlet tested positive. The outlet has remained closed since, with deep-cleaning carried out and all employees swabbed and told to self-isolate to minimise any transmission risks. Referring to residents of Block 506, Aljunied GRC MP Gerald Giam said some were wondering if the such testing would become a routine every two weeks. \"The answer is that we don\\'t know for sure,\" he said. \"The reason why there is another round of swabbing is that new cases were discovered in Block 506. What we do ask is for the residents\\' understanding... We know it\\'s not easy.\" Join ST\\'s Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.

       " {'text': \"covid 19 curbs slow down singapore manufacturing activity in may Read 3 articles daily and stand to win ST rewards, including the ST News Tablet worth $398. Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - Mobility curbs at home and abroad to contain a flare up of Covid-19 slowed manufacturing activity in Singapore last month, even as the sector grew for an 11th month. However, analysts said that, assuming the Covid-19 curbs are lifted as scheduled, the full-year trajectory for the manufacturing sector remains sound. The Singapore Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for last month posted a surprise retreat of 0.2 points from April to record a weaker rate of expansion at 50.7, according to data released on Wednesday (June 2). Economists in a Bloomberg poll had forecast a median of 51 points for the month, up from April’s 50.9, which was the highest reading since December 2018 – when the PMI came at 51.1. A reading above 50 indicates expansion; one below indicates contraction. Singapore imposed phase two (heightened alert) restrictions on May 16 to stamp out a surge in local infections. The curbs, the tightest since the circuit breaker last year, are expected to be eased after June 13. Several Singapore trading partners also imposed new lockdowns with varying intensities last month. They include, among others, Australia, Japan, Taiwan, Malaysia and Thailand. The Singapore Institute of Purchasing and Materials Management (SIPMM), which compiles the monthly PMI report, said that the PMI reading for last month was attributed to slower expansion rates in the sub-indexes of new orders, new exports, factory output and employment. Ms Sophia Poh, vice-president for industry engagement and development at SIPMM, said: “The heightened alert measures introduced in May have affected the manufacturing sector, but the extent will depend on the duration of the tightened measures.” On the flip side, the supplier deliveries index reverted to a marginal expansion, and the inventory index posted a faster expansion rate, the PMI report said. The indexes of input prices and order backlog also recorded faster rates of expansion, while the overall employment index expanded for the third straight month. The order backlog grew for an 11th consecutive month. Ms Poh said that anecdotal evidence suggests that manufacturers are facing delivery postponements instead of order cancellations. “This could explain the faster supplier deliveries with increasing order backlog,” she noted. The electronics sector PMI expanded for the 10th consecutive month, but fell 0.3 point from the previous month to a slower expansion of 50.4. The drop was attributed to a slow down in new orders, new exports, factory output, inventory, and employment. However, supplier deliveries, stocks of finished goods, input prices and order backlog posted faster expansions. The electronics employment and the electronics order backlog indexes have now recorded seven and 11 consecutive months of expansion respectively, the report showed. UOB economist Barnabas Gan said that, barring an exacerbation of Covid-19 infections, the manufacturing sector is expected to be one of the key pillars of growth this year. “Singapore’s export-oriented industries are expected to ride on the winds of global trade growth, which should subsequently benefit externally facing sectors such as manufacturing, wholesale and retail trade, and financial services,” he said. Mr Gan expects Singapore’s manufacturing to grow by 5.5 per cent this year. Join ST's Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - A new Covid-19 cluster of 13 cases at Block 506 Hougang Avenue 8 was announced by the Ministry of Health (MOH) on Thursday (June 3). Twelve previously confirmed cases have been linked to this cluster. One new case, a 58-year-old housewife, was among the 35 cases in the community reported on Thursday. Analysis conducted by the National Public Health Laboratory revealed links among previous cases to this cluster, said MOH. The new cluster in Hougang Avenue 8 includes a sub-cluster of four cases linked to a 67-year-old retiree who was confirmed to have the virus on May 26. The cluster\\'s earliest detected case was a 57-year-old unemployed woman who lives at the Hougang block, and was confirmed to have Covid-19 on May 15. A special testing operation was carried out at the block on May 21 and 22 after the earlier cases were detected. MOH said on Thursday that its continuous surveillance detected likely new Covid-19 transmission in the vicinity of Hougang Avenue 8. Besides new cases, Covid-19 viral fragments were also detected in wastewater samples collected from some of these blocks, the ministry added. \"To ring-fence possible cases, mandatory polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing will be conducted for all residents and visitors of Block 506 Hougang Avenue, as well asthe staff of shops in neighbouring blocks, from Friday to Saturday between 9am and4pm.\" This mandatory testing is being carried out to detect cases who were still incubating the virus in the first round of testing and to prevent spread in the community. The neighbouring blocks comprise Block 511 Hougang Avenue 10, Blocks 681, 683 and 684 Hougang Avenue 8, Block 682 Hougang Avenue 4, as well as Blocks 685 and 698 Hougang Street 61. In the event that a positive case is detected, MOH will isolate the case, identify all close contacts, test and quarantine them to protect the community from further transmission. Voluntary PCR testing will also be conducted for residents and visitors of the seven neighbouring Housing Boardblocks this month. Residents and visitors from May 19 to Thursday of these blocks are also encouraged to come forward for testing. Meanwhile, MOH has concluded mandatory PCR tests for 828 residents and visitors of Blocks 501 and 507 Hougang Avenue 8. As at 8pm on Thursday, one person has tested positive, while 680 people have been found to be negative. Twenty-two of Thursday\\'s new community cases are from the MINDSville@Napiri cluster, which was first detected when a 37-year-old female resident tested positive for the virus on Monday. The 19 residents and three nursing aides had already been quarantined prior to their positive test results. The staff and 17 residents have vaccinated. They take the total number of people linked to the cluster to 27. The sole unlinked community case on Thursday is a 41-year-old coating inspector withSBM Offshore at Keppel Shipyard\\'s Tuas Yard. He had previously travelled to India last July, and returned to Singapore on April 20. Of the new community cases, 28 had already been placed on quarantine. There were also 10 imported cases who had been placed on stay-home notice on arrival in Singapore. With 45 new cases, Singapore has a total tally of 62,145 cases.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE (THE BUSINESS TIMES) - The benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) gained ground over the course of the trading day on Thursday (June 10), particularly after the news about the easing of Covid-19 restrictions broke. It then dipped slightly thereafter to end at 3,162.50, up 9.03 points, or 0.29 per cent. On Thursday afternoon, the authorities announced that groups of up to five people will be allowed to gather from June 14, as the country moves into what has been labelled phase three(heightened alert). Dining in at food and beverage establishments for groups of up to five people will also be allowed from June 21, if the local Covid-19 situation remains under control in the coming weeks. Among the STI constituents, aviation counters were the day\\'s top gainers. Singapore Airlines emerged at the top of the index, advancing 1.99 per cent, or 10 cents,to end at $5.12. Sats, the ground-handling and in-flight catering service provider at Changi Airport,closed up 1.96 per cent, or eight cents,at $4.16. On Wednesday night, The Straits Times reported that South Korea is hoping to expedite travel bubble talks with the likes of Singapore and Taiwan to allow quarantine-free travel for fully vaccinated people from as early as July. CapitaLand was also among the top performers for the day, with the counter gaining 1.08 per cent, or four cents, to end at $3.74. In a note on Thursday, RHB analyst Vijay Natarajan said that the brokerage maintains its \"overweight\" call on the real estate sector, with CapitaLand as its top pick, \"as we remain positive on (CapitaLand\\'s) latest value unlocking move\". The residential market is expected to maintain its upward momentum in the forecast for the second half of 2021,\"after a slight near-term slowdown\", with key drivers remaining falling inventory levels, low interest rates and the uptick in the economy and employment numbers, he added. Meanwhile, Sembcorp Industries slumped to the bottom of the index, falling 1.38 per cent, or three cents,to end at $2.15. On the broader market, decliners outnumbered advancers 250 to 232 for the day, with 1.95 billion securities worth $1.06 billion changing hands. Across the region, most Asian markets ended the day in positive territory. The Nikkei 225 Index rose 97.76 points, or 0.34 per cent, to end at 28,958.56, while the benchmark Kospi advanced 8.46 points, or 0.26 per cent, to 3,224.64.

       " {'text': 'greek alphabet for covid 19 variants whats in a name Read 3 articles daily and stand to win ST rewards, including the ST News Tablet worth $398. Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - The use of the Greek alphabet to name Covid-19 variants was done after the consideration of other possibilities, such as numbering them \"VOC 1\", a shorthand for \"variant of concern 1\". This option was thrown out as \"VOC\" sounded like a swear word when verbalised, Professor Dale Fisher, chairman of the World Health Organisation\\'s (WHO) Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network, said. He was speaking to The Straits Times on how the WHO had arrived on these new names, after questions swirled around how meaningful these names would be, given the lack of scientific basis behind them. Some people also felt that the new names were confusing. The public often associates variants with the nations where they were first detected, such as the \"Indian variant\" or \"South African variant\", as these are easy to remember and refer to, Prof Fisher said. This leads to some level of stigmatisation, and the use of scientific names can also get confusing as they may sound similar to the names of the different mutations, he said. Another option was to name the variants after the Greek gods, but way too many had been taken up in other places such as comics and movies, Prof Fisher added. The WHO eventually settled on the use of the Greek alphabet. It contains 24 letters, but there is no plan yet on where to go next if they are exhausted. These new names will not replace existing scientific names, but are aimed to help in public discussion, the WHO said. Under the new system, the four variants of concern take on the following names: the hitherto so-called British variant B117 becomes Alpha; the B1351 first detected in South Africa becomes Beta, while the Brazilian P.1 becomes Gamma. The so-called Indian variant B1617 is split into sub-lineages, of which the B16172 variant of concern becomes Delta. Much effort was also put into the naming. Scientists and experts from areas such as virology, as well as representatives from the Global Influenza Data Initiative, were part of the group that convened to discuss the naming. Time will tell if these new names stick. Prof Fisher recalls how when \"Covid-19\" and \"Sars-CoV-2\" were introduced in February last year - to name the disease (Covid-19) and the virus (Sars-CoV-2) - many people felt they were cumbersome and tough to remember. But fast forward to today, these names roll off the tongue so easily and have clearly caught on, said Prof Fisher. The virus was initially referred to as the \"Wuhan virus\", since it was first detected in Wuhan, China. The use of names will also depend on who the audience is, Prof Fisher said. \"Within the scientific community, scientific names like B16172 will likely still be used. But for communication with the general public, using the Greek alphabet might be easier,\" he said. Join ST\\'s Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - Pre-schoolers and pre-school staff with potential exposure to Covid-19 - such as having household members who have been quarantined following close contact with a Covid-19 case - will be placed under more stringent measures from Tuesday (June 8). Announcing the measures in a circular last Friday, the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) said that a child or staff member with someone in the same household waiting to be taken to a government quarantine facility, or waiting for their Covid-19 test result while under quarantine, will now be placed on leave of absence. They can return to the pre-school only after the household member has gone to the facility, and has a negative result from a Covid-19 polymerase chain reaction test when they enter quarantine, the ECDA said. Currently, leave of absence is issued only if a household member is in quarantine or under stay-home notice (SHN) at home. And the child or employee is allowed to return to the pre-school after the affected household member has completed the quarantine or SHN. Additionally, leave of absence will be issued for the whole class if a child or pre-school staff member who was recently on the premises was unwell before being quarantined following exposure to a case, or if they became unwell soon after starting quarantine. The class is allowed to return to the pre-school once the affected pre-schooler or staff member has a negative Covid-19 result when they enter quarantine. If the quarantined individual is generally well, parents will be informed of such cases, and parents will be strongly encouraged to keep children who are in the same class at home if possible, the ECDA added. On top of that, if a child or pre-school staff member is undergoing mandatory Covid-19 tests because of potential exposure to cases, leave of absence will be issued to them. If pre-schoolers\\' household members have to be tested, parents are strongly encouraged to keep their child at home. They can return once they have a negative Covid-19 result. In the circular, Ms Jamie Ang, chief executive of the ECDA, said the agency recognises that the new arrangements may be inconvenient for families and pre-schools. She asked for their understanding, given the increased transmissibility of new Covid-19 variantsand the lack of vaccines currently approved for young children. \"As pre-school premises are relatively more compact and children or staff are in close contact for a prolonged period, the impact of any transmission on pre-schools and families is significant,\" said Ms Ang.

Nine infections were linked to previous cases. Fiveof them had been placed in quarantine earlier and four were detected through surveillance testing,said the Ministry of Health (MOH). An 84-year-old Singaporean woman died on Saturday from complications due to COVID-19, becoming the 36th fatality in Singapore. The woman was not vaccinated against COVID-19, and had ahistory of cancer, hypertension and hyperlipidaemia, MOH said. Identified asCase 64255, the woman\\'s infection was detected on Jun 15 throughcommunity surveillance testing for visitors to Blocks 115 and 116 Bukit Merah View. The National Centre for Infectious Diseases has reached out to her family and is extending assistance to them, said MOH. CGH NURSE, NAVY SERVICEMAN AMONG UNLINKED CASES A 21-year-old nurse who works at Changi General Hospital (CGH) was among the four unlinked community cases. Identified as Case 64464, she was fully vaccinated. She underwent rostered routine testing on Jun 23, and developed a fever and runny nose the next day.Her test result came back positive for COVID-19 on Jun 25.Her serology test result was negative for the N antigen, suggesting the presence of early infection, said MOH. The nurse\\'s earlier results fromrostered routine testing had all come back negative, with the last being on Jun 14. Another unlinked case was a 27-year-old serviceman in the Republic of Singapore Navy, who was fully vaccinated.The man had been identified as a close contact of an earlier case, a 57-year-old who works as a promoterat Guardian in ION Orchard. The serviceman was placed in quarantine on Jun 10. He tested negative for COVID-19 in tests taken on Jun 10, Jun 11, Jun 18 and Jun 21 while in quarantine. His quarantine ended on Jun 22, but he subsequently developed a fever on the evening of Jun 24. He sought medical treatment at a polyclinic the next day, and bothhisantigen rapid test (ART) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test came back positive. His serology test result was pending. In a separate news release, the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) said the serviceman last visited Tuas Naval Base on Jun 24. \"As part of precautionary measures in place, the (Singapore Armed Forces) has carried out immediate and thorough disinfection of the premises the serviceman had been in,\" said MINDEF. Thoseidentified as close contacts were also swab tested for COVID-19 and placed under quarantine.Theserviceman was warded at Parkway East Hospital, and SAF hasbeen in contact with him and his family to provide support and assistance, added MINDEF. A 32-year-old woman who works as an administrative staff memberat Walt Disney was the third unlinked case. She developed a fever, cough and body aches on Jun 16 but did not seek medical attention until Jun 21 through a telehealth provider. She was not referred for a COVID-19 test, said MOH. On Jun 24, the woman sought medical treatment at a clinic, where she was tested for COVID-19. The result came back positive the next day, and her serology test result was also positive. The remaining unlinked case was a 76-year-old retiree. Her infection wasdetected when she sought medical treatment at Singapore General Hospital for an unrelated medical condition on Jun 25, and was tested for COVID-19. Her test result came back positive the next day, and her serology test result was pending. CGHCLUSTER GROWS WITH TWO MORE CASES Two more cases were linked to a cluster at CGH, which now totalsfive cases. All of the cases work as porters at the hospital. The new cases were a 48-year-old Singaporean woman and a 66-year-old Singaporean man who work as porters. Both were fully vaccinated, andwere workplace contacts of the other cases in the cluster. The woman was placed in quarantine on Jun 24 and tested positive for COIVD-19 on Jun 25 during quarantine. Her earlier tests from rostered routine testing were all negative, the last being on Jun 22.Her serology test result was pending. The man developed symptoms on Jun 23 and sought treatment at a clinic the next day where he was tested for COVID-19. His test came back positive on Jun 24.

       " {'text': 'askst can i mix and match different types of covid 19 vaccines to get more Read 3 articles daily and stand to win ST rewards, including the ST News Tablet worth $398. Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - As more Covid-19 vaccines have been added to the World Health Organisation\\'s listing for emergency use, new questions have emerged on how these vaccines should be best deployed. For instance, some countries are planning to use different vaccines for first and second doses because of concerns over vaccine supply or side effects linked to a particular vaccine. Others believe that combining vaccines may confer broader, more long-lasting immunity to the virus. Canada has given the green light for people who received a first shot of AstraZeneca\\'s vaccine to get a different vaccine for their second dose, citing concerns over rare, potentially fatal blood clots linked to the AstraZeneca product. In Britain, a study led by Oxford University is looking at the impact mixing vaccines could have on the body\\'s immune response, among other things. Another topic of much study is how effective vaccines are against the various viral variants. In Singapore, there is also the issue of whether the Sinovac vaccine - which has already been paid for and delivered - might be a good alternative for those who cannot take either the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine due to allergies. Here are answers to some of these questions. A: In theory, doing so should work well to prevent Covid-19 infections, said Professor Ooi Eng Eong of Duke-NUS Medical School\\'s emerging infectious diseases programme. But much remains uncertain. For instance, scientists do not know what the actual efficacy rate of protection against Covid-19 is when vaccines are used this way. It is also unclear how the order in which the vaccines are given can impact the body\\'s immune response, he said. Dr Clarence Tam, an assistant professor at the National University of Singapore\\'s Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, added that different vaccines trigger immune responses in different ways. \"But currently, we do not have information on the strength and quality of immune responses to different combinations of vaccines, so it is not advisable to mix and match vaccine types, unless there is a medical reason to do so.\" The Oxford study found that side effects such as chills, headaches and muscle pains were reported more frequently among those who took a combination of the Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca vaccines, as compared with those who took two doses of the same vaccine. A: There is also no evidence that a third vaccine dose will improve one\\'s level of immunity against Covid-19, Prof Ooi said. This is especially since vaccine efficacy for the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna jabs - both of which make use of mRNA technology - is already as high as 95 per cent. He added that the genetic sequence of the spike gene for the other vaccines that have been given special access for use in Singapore is similar to what is being used in the two existing mRNA vaccines. A: Yes, for viruses such as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Ebola. According to the Gavi vaccine alliance - which runs the global Covax vaccine-sharing programme with the World Health Organisation - protecting against HIV requires a complex immune reaction that would be \"near impossible to achieve with one type of vaccine\". This is why the best HIV vaccine available now is a combination of different types. The same goes for Johnson & Johnson\\'s Ebola vaccine, which is also a mixed product. A: Scientists have suggested that allergic reactions may be triggered by lipid nanoparticles in the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines - an ingredient that helps protect mRNA molecules and allows them to enter human cells. This means that \"some diversity\" in vaccine types would be useful, said Dr Danny Soon, a member of the Expert Committee on Covid-19 Vaccination, earlier this week. This includes inactivated virus vaccines such as the Sinovac one, where an actual virus sample is taken from an infected patient and cultivated. It is then inactivated so that it cannot replicate or cause disease. When vaccinated, the body reacts to specific proteins that remain around the \"shell\" of the virus to mount an immune response. A: The evidence so far suggests that viral variants may evade the ability of the body\\'s antibodies to neutralise infection, but cannot fully escape its overall immune response, Prof Ooi said. He pointed out that neutralising infection is just one of the many protective functions mounted by our body\\'s immune response. For instance, antibodies can trigger other components of the immune system to kill infected cells, which will limit the spread of infection. Killer T-cells, which are a type of white blood cell, can also effectively remove infected cells and the viruses within. \"Vaccines that generate good antibody and T-cell responses, such as the mRNA vaccines and viral vector vaccines, are thus likely to be effective even against the variants,\" Prof Ooi said. Pfizer and Moderna both make use of mRNA technology, while AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson make use of what is known as a viral vector. Under this method, the coronavirus\\' DNA is inserted into a host virus. When vaccinated, the body produces certain proteins against which it mounts an immune response. Preliminary data from places with high vaccination rates suggests that despite the genetic differences among Covid-19 variants and the associated increase in infectiousness, such vaccines remain highly effective in preventing symptomatic infection and the development of severe disease, Prof Ooi added.

       " {'text': 'covid 19 vaccine could become like yearly flu shot say experts on straits times Read 3 articles daily and stand to win ST rewards, including the ST News Tablet worth $398. Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE -With the coronavirus that causes Covid-19 likely to be endemic, regular vaccinationwill be the new normal, experts said at a live panel discussion organised by The Straits Times on Tuesday (June 1). “At some point, we will see Covid-19 being included as part of our national immunisation schedule for both adults and children, and perhaps we will need regular booster shots from time to time to make sure we continue to be protected, especially against any new emerging variants,” said Professor Teo Yik Ying, dean of the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health at the National University of Singapore. “And, once in a while, there will be people who will be infected, just like TB (tuberculosis), just like tetanus.” Most may not even know that they have been infected, he said.But crucially, a Covid-19 infection for someone who is vaccinated “no longer bears a real risk of being hospitalised or potentially dying from it”, added Prof Teo. The view was shared by Prof Lisa Ng, executive director of the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*Star) Infectious Diseases Labs. “The coronavirus is a very large RNA virus, so it is bound to have occasional mutations as the virus continues to spread and evolve... but it is actually very important to note that most mutations are actually harmless and do not necessarily cause more severe diseases in healthy people,” she said. “Now, currently, the data has indicated that while this particular mutation is more transmissible, it is not necessarily more deadly. So eventually, Covid-19 will become endemic, like the common cold and other respiratory infections.” Shesaid that it would be useful to take booster shots that have been updated with the different new variants, much like how the flu vaccine shots are updated regularly. Meanwhile, scientists need to stay updated on the sequences of all the emerging new variants so that detection systems and assays will remain robust and sensitive enough to detect the virus even in asymptomatic patients, Prof Ng added. Assays aretesting procedures for investigating the concentration of a substance. Dr Danny Soon, chief executive officer of the Consortium for Clinical Research and Innovation, Singapore, warned that the pandemic is far from over, as a small leak can take hold among unvaccinated people. But people now can do something about it and get vaccinated, said Dr Soon, whoisalso a member of the Ministry of Health Expert Committee on Covid-19 Vaccination. “Very few people who are vaccinated get very ill or die from the disease,” he noted. In May, even as the Covid-19 outbreaks in the United States and Britain were 10 times worse than in Singapore, both countries felt infection numbers were good enough to loosen restrictions and allow people to mingle more. Singapore, at this point, tightened measures further, stopping dine-in at eateries and putting in place home-based learning for students, among other restrictions, Prof Teo noted. \"On a per capita basis- the number of cases given the number of population each country has -Singapore\\'s outbreak in May was actually 10 times less than what the UK and the US were experiencing at that time,\" he said. This was when Singapore adjusted its measures to keep up with new variants that had infiltrated the country, including the more infectious B1617 strain first discovered in India. People infected with the variant have a much higher viral load, and the incubation periodis also a lot more variable compared with the past, as a person can be contagious just one or two days after being infected, or after more than 14 days, said Prof Teo. The experts’ comments at the ST panel, Living With Covid-19: Singapore’s New Normal, which was moderated by ST science correspondent Audrey Tan, came a day aftera nationally broadcast address by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on living with an endemic virus. Mr Lee said Singapore will ramp up its pace of vaccination, and both test for and contact trace Covid-19 cases more quickly and extensively going forward as the country adjusts to deal with more infectious variants. He added that self-testing may become part of the new normal. Covid-19 is the latest disease to emerge in an increasingly globalised and densely populated world. Scientists have said that more will come. At this point, while Covid-19 continues to rage around the world, it is at least clear based on data from Singapore and globally that vaccination works. Citing preliminary data from Singapore, Prof Ng said 97 to 98 per cent of vaccinated individuals will generate antibodies against the spike protein of the coronavirus. In the US, where more than 100 million people have been vaccinated, data suggests that when infected, these people show very mild or no symptoms at all, noted Prof Teo. He added that vaccination is not just to protect but it is also to enable us to return to a degree of normalcy in our lives.

       " {'text': 'parents concerned about covid 19 vaccine side effects but keen to get children protected Read 3 articles daily and stand to win ST rewards, including the ST News Tablet worth $398. Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - While parents are concerned about the side effects of the Covid-19 vaccination on their children, most are still keen to sign them up for the jab to protect them against the coronavirus. Some parents The Straits Times spoke to on Tuesday (June 1) said they were looking forward to getting their children vaccinated,for peace of mind when they return to school - especially if they are taking national exams this year. There were some who questioned the long-term implications of the vaccination, while others were not concerned about side effects, having taken the jabs themselves. The authorities had announced on Monday that more than 400,000 students aged 12 and above would be next in line for the national vaccination drive, and they can start booking appointments for their shots from Tuesday. Mr Mohd Shaiful, 42, who has three school-going children aged 12, 15 and 18, said he wants his children to be vaccinated for their own protection and to reduce their chances of getting the virus. The technician is fully vaccinated, and had a mild fever after. \"I am not worried about the side effects. I think the kids should be fine,\" he said. Mrs Lim Bee Lan, 49, a housewife, said she was glad vaccinations are being rolled out for students as it could mean less disruptions to learning. Schools had switched to full home-based learning for nearly two weeks after a spate of infections among children in the recent Covid-19 outbreak here. \"I\\'m glad that there are things being done. It\\'s quite concerning for the kids with school being disrupted. It would be great if we can move forward with less disruptions for the kids and teachers,\" said Mrs Lim, whose three daughters are aged 12, 14 and 16. She is gettingher second dose of the vaccine this week. \"I will sign them up for the vaccine. It\\'s good to be safe and it\\'s also to protect others. In a school environment, exposure to the virus could be quite high. There\\'s very little that can be done to separate the children,\" she added. Housewife Jasmine Chua, who has a 13-year-old son in Secondary 1, is on the fence about letting her son take the vaccine. The 48-year-old has not taken the vaccine herself as she is concerned about the potential long-term side effects or complications, though her husband is vaccinated. She said she is leaving the choice to her son, who also seems concerned about the long-term side effects. Currently, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is the only Covid-19 vaccine that has been authorised for use in adolescents aged 12 to 17 in Singapore. Those aged 18 and above can opt for either the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine. At a webinar organised by the Ministry of Education (MOE) on Tuesday, three panellists addressed questions from parents on the side effects as well as the safety and efficacy of the vaccine for children. The webinar was attended by 3,000 people, which was its maximum capacity. A parent who attended the webinar said the panellists were MOE director of schools Liew Wei-Li, MOE coordinating divisional director for the higher education group Jan Chua and Health Ministry deputy director for professional training and assessment standardsAlvin Lee. Asked why children need to be vaccinated, given that the long-term impact of the vaccine is unknown and children with Covid-19 usually recover with no complications, the panellists pointed to cases of the virus spreading within households, and how it is more challenging to ensure children follow safe distancing rules. In the event that the Covid-19 vaccine clashes with other vaccines like the cervical cancer jab which is available for Secondary 1 female students, vaccinations should be scheduled at least two weeks apart. The panellists also assured parents that MOE will not segregate or distinguish students based on whether they are vaccinated, for example, by seating them separately during exams. On why vaccinations are not done on-site at each school like how booster shots for primary and secondary school children are usually rolled out, they pointed to the large numberof students and said having jabs done at designated centres will allow parents to pick a time and venue that is convenient for their child.

       " {'text': '800m covid 19 support package to help firms workers Read 3 articles daily and stand to win ST rewards, including the ST News Tablet worth $398. Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. An $800 million support package that includes enhanced wage subsidies under the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) and rental relief will be rolled out to help businesses and workers cope with the impact of tightened Covid-19 restrictions. Announcing the measures yesterday, Finance Minister Lawrence Wong said affected gyms, fitness studios, and performing arts and arts education centres will get 50 per cent of salary support for local employees under the JSS - the same as what food and beverage operators are currently receiving. Sectors that do not have to suspend operations but are significantly affected by the measures will get 30 per cent of JSS subsidies. This will help retailers, personal care service providers, museums, art galleries, historical sites, cinemas, indoor playgrounds and other family entertainment centres. However, supermarkets, convenience stores and online retailers will not be eligible for the enhanced wage support. Rental relief will be given to eligible small and medium-sized enterprises as well as non-profit organisations in qualifying commercial properties, Mr Wong said. Eligible lower-and middle-income workers and self-employed workers whose income has been affected can also receive a one-off payout of up to $700 under a new temporary grant. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) said yesterday that the enhanced JSS payouts, which are based on wages paid from April to next month, will be disbursed in September. Employers who put local employees on mandatory no-pay leave or retrench them will not be eligible for JSS payouts for those employees, MOF said. \"I would encourage businesses to make full use of their enhanced JSS to retain and pay their workers during this period,\" said Mr Wong. The various support measures for those affected by the phase two (heightened alert) restrictions from May 16 to June 13 will not require an additional draw on past reserves, he said. Instead, they will be funded through a reallocation of spending. Some development expenditure can be funded by the Significant Infrastructure Government Loan Act (Singa), which allows the Government to fund long-term infrastructure projects through borrowing, said MOF. This was not reflected in the budgeted expenditure as the Singa Bill was passed on May 10, after the February Budget. A Supplementary Supply Bill will be tabled at the next Parliament sitting in July to effect the reallocation of spending. Speaking at a virtual media conference, Mr Wong, who is co-chair of the multi-ministry task force on Covid-19, said the tightened measures are having an effect in controlling the spread of the virus. \"Therefore, we do not think there is a need for further tightening in our overall posture,\" he said, adding that the task force will give a fuller update on Monday. If there are further extensions of the restrictions beyond June 13, MOF will consider whether support measures can be similarly extended, he said. He noted that the financial support package handed out this time round is not on the same scale as those allocated last year. This is because most parts of the economy are still operating, and there are also more government schemes, like the Jobs Growth Incentive, to support new opportunities. Last year, close to $100 billion was dedicated to Covid-19 support measures over five Budgets, with up to $52 billion drawn from the reserves. Mr Wong said Singapore must expect to encounter situations like this from time to time, where restrictions need to be tightened temporarily in response to occasional outbreaks. \"So, we will have to learn to adapt to such situations using our own resources rather than to dip into our past reserves,\" he said.

A professional disinfection company was engaged to conduct deep cleaning and disinfection at the Ion Orchard outlet on Monday, the bakery chain\\'s senior manager, Mr Koji Tanabe, said in a statement on Wednesday. He added that the outlet has been closed since Tuesday till further notice as a precautionary measure. Mr Tanabe said that the employee had also been to the Four Leaves outlet in AMK Hub for training on May 23, after which she worked at the Ion outlet. He said the Ministry of Health (MOH) had informed the company that there was no need to quarantine the AMK Hub outlet staff as more than 14 days had passed prior to the woman\\'s positive test. The staff will be placed under phone surveillance instead and may be swabbed if necessary. Four Leaves decided to stop operations at its AMK Hub outlet on Wednesday and have the outlet deep-cleaned and disinfected, Mr Tanabe added. \"As an additional precautionary measure, we will also arrange for all AMK Hub staff to go for swab tests,\" he said. MOHhad said on Tuesday that the infected staff member is a 35-year-old Malaysian woman. She developed a fever, cough, sore throat and runny nose last Saturdaybut did not seek medical treatment until Monday, when she visited a general practitioner. She was immediately isolated when her antigen rapid test result came back positive for Covid-19. Her polymerase chain reaction test result also came back positiveon the same day. From the MOH statement, it appears that the woman had been working at the Ion Orchard outlet on June 3, 4, 5 and 6, as the location and dates appear under the ministry\\'s list of public places that community cases have been to while infectious. Dr Rayner Tan, postdoctoral fellow at the National University of Singapore\\'s Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, said that customers should not be worried about transmission via food as there is no evidence currently to suggest that the virus can be transmitted via food and food packaging. \"While Covid-19 may be transmitted through established pathways such as droplets or contaminated surfaces, the risk of transmission through contaminated surfaces on food and food packaging, if any, isdramatically reduced by existing food and beverage industry standards,\" he said. Retail assistants and bakers are required to adhere to certain minimum standards of food safety when working at food retail outlets - such as covering displayed food items, regular hand-washing, cleaning of premises, proper use of glovesand, now amid the pandemic, mandatory wearing of masks, he said. When asked about risk of transmission from a customer-facing role like a retail assistant, he said that the risk is much lower because the contact is transient. Additionally, food handlers also have to adhere to hygiene practices. \"Regardless, customers should monitor their health,\" said Dr Tan. Professor Dale Fisher, an infectious diseases expert at the National University of Singapore\\'s Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, said: \"It would be virtually impossible to catch Covid-19 from a loaf of bread... Even if a small amount of virus did find its way onto the bread, it cannot be transmitted by eating it.\" He added that ifa customer is a contact of the retail assistant,he will be notified. But if not, he \"should not worry\". Join ST\\'s Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. SPH Digital News / Copyright © 2021 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd. Co. Regn.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE (BLOOMBERG) - Singapore government bonds beat their biggest developed-market peers in May as a flare-up in coronavirus infections in the city state fostered demand for haven assets. The securities gained 1 per cent last month, a performance that trails only that of South African and Mexican notes among 30 of the world\\'s largest debt markets, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Fifteen- and 20-year bonds outperformed other tenors. Singapore was forced to reimpose a month of lockdown-like conditions from May 16 to quell a rising number of infections, its first return to tightening restrictions since last year. The city state\\'s bonds also caught a bid from subdued inflation and a lack of supply pressures. \"The implicit increase in household savings from restrained activity has been beneficial for longer-tenor bonds and supporting their relative outperformance,\" said Mr Philip McNicholas, Asean foreign-exchange and rates strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence. \"A general normalisation in US post-reopening economic activity could give further tailwind to Singapore dollar bonds as (Federal Reserve) tightening gets pushed back.\" Infections in the city state have since stabilised. Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on Monday (May 31) thatrestrictions may be eased in two weeks. The lack of price pressures is another boon for bonds. Economists estimate that Singapore\\'s consumer prices will rise just 1.3 per cent this year, compared with an average gain of 2.3 per cent for developed markets. This would make the city state the only AAA-rated market that offers positive inflation-adjusted yields. Singapore\\'s bonds may remain supported because of a lack of supply of long-dated debt in June, said Mr Winson Phoon, head of fixed-income research at Maybank Kim Eng Securities in Singapore. An auction of new July 2031 notes on June 28, the last scheduled sale of 10-year debt this year, will be the market\\'s next point of focus. \"Overwhelming US dollar liquidity is prompting investors to look for better returns outside of the US,\" said Mr Eugene Leow, a rates strategist at DBS Bank in Singapore. \"Singapore is doing well on the vaccination front even as the economy is still under more stringent Covid-19 restrictions.\" Join ST\\'s Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.

       " {'text': 'covid 19 vaccination slots pfizer moderna shorter wait faster 15039748 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: Individuals looking to book their COVID-19 vaccination slots for the Moderna vaccine are likely to face a shorter wait, compared with those opting for the Pfizer-BioNTech jab. Experts CNA spoke have urged residents not to delay getting their vaccinations, saying there is no reason to wait. This comes a week after the country opened COVID-19 vaccinations to those aged 12 to 39. Health Minister Ong Ye Kungsaid at a COVID-19 multi-ministry task force press conference last week that those who book appointments at a centre offering the Moderna vaccine would likely get an earlier slot, as younger students are only able to get the Pfizer-BioNTech jab. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is approved for individuals as young as 12 years old in Singapore, whereas the Moderna vaccine is approved for those aged 18 and above. A check by CNA at 1pm on Friday (Jun 18) showed that the earliest available slots for vaccines were on Jun 19, and only at community clubs offering the Moderna shots. In total, 10 community clubs (CCs) in locations such as Buona Vista and the Radin Mas neighbourhood in Bukit Merah were listed as having “more”available slots. In comparison, the next available slot for the Pfizer vaccine was on Jul 5 at Choa Chu Kang Polyclinic, according to the COVID-19 vaccination appointment booking system. Infectious disease experts told CNA that if more people choose to delay their vaccinations, this could potentially hamper the resumption of more social and economic activities. “Consistently, we’re seeing more people that have not been vaccinated falling sick ... We also see them hospitalised and using up precious hospital resources,” said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease expert at the Rophi Clinic at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. “The more cases there are, the less likely we will open up or the more difficult it is to open up,” he added. It could also hold Singapore back from meeting its target of vaccinating at least half of its residents fully by August, and at least 75 per cent by October, according to Professor Dale Fisher, a senior consultant at the National University Hospital’s division of infectious disease. “It’s not going to have a big effect from a public health point of view if it\\'s just a few people, but if it\\'s tens of thousands of people, obviously it\\'ll have an impact,” he said. The situation may soon improve, with private healthcare institutions now allowed to access and administer the Government\\'s stock of Sinovac COVID-19 vaccines, said experts. Professor Paul Tambyah, president of the Asia Pacific Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infection, said the likelihood is that there will be more than enough supply of vaccines. This will make it easier to reopen social and economic activities if vaccination rates overall go up with private sector involvement, he said. PFIZER VS MODERNA As of Jun 15,more than 4.7 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine have been administered in Singapore. More than 2.7 million people - or about 47 per cent of Singapore\\'s population, have received at least onedose of a vaccine. Currently, only two vaccines - Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna - have been approved for Singapore’s national vaccination programme. Both use messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which works by teaching cells to make a protein that can trigger an immune response inside bodies. This is different from traditional vaccines, which put a weakened or inactivated germ into bodies. In terms of efficacy, both vaccines are similar. The Pfizer vaccine has an efficacy of 95 per cent against COVID-19, while Moderna has a 94 per cent efficacy. This means that both vaccines should provide the same degree of protection against COVID-19, said Professor Teo Yik Ying, dean of the National University of Singapore\\'s Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health. However, Pfizer has been linked with fewer occurrences of mild side effects such as fever and fatigue compared with Moderna, he said. These are “non-life threatening” side effects that emerge as a consequence of the body responding to the vaccine, he added. “I emphasize, though, that both vaccines are very safe with very low rates of severe allergic reactions. In fact, Moderna has slightly less than half the risk of severe reactions such as anaphylaxis, so my recommendation is that there is no real need to wait.\" The differences in side effects could be due to the way the vaccines were manufactured or the content of the vaccines, although there has not been enough research on this,according to Dr Leong. “One noticeable difference is (there is) 30 micrograms in each shot of the Pfizer vaccine, but 100 micrograms in each shot of Moderna vaccine, ” he said. “So the more there is, potentially, there may be more reaction.” GET VACCINATED NOW, DON\\'T WAIT Experts cautioned against delaying vaccination, citing risks of being infected with COVID-19 and developing serious disease. On Friday, Mr Ong provided data showing how more cases of unvaccinated COVID-19 patients required supplemental oxygen. A total of 629 COVID-19 local cases reported since Apr 11 were not fully vaccinated, said Mr Ong. Of those, about 8.6 per cent, or 54 patients, subsequently required supplemental oxygen or were warded in the intensive care unit, he said. In contrast, only twoout of 158 vaccinated COVID-19 patients - about 1.3 per cent - required supplemental oxygen. The two patients had pre-existing conditions, according to Mr Ong. Prof Fisher said there was “no logic” in delaying vaccinations, particularly if it was due to perceived differences in their side effects or efficacy. “I presume there are conversations between people and that someone said ‘I had Pfizer and it felt really good’, then other people will say ‘oh, I’ll get Pfizer too’ but there\\'s no logic to that - the data is essentially the same,” he said. “The reason to not wait ... is because you can get COVID and you can get very sick and you can die. Even those who are young and healthy should take the opportunity to be vaccinated as early as possible, urged Prof Teo. “For every additional person that is vaccinated early, it is one fewer person in the community that remains completely susceptible to be infected,” he said. “Even though vaccination does not completely prevent one from being infected, it does result in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic infection which is less contagious.” “So not only is there one fewer person that is completely susceptible, the chance of spreading to others as a result of an infection also reduces,” he added.

       " {'text': 'covid 19 phase 3 heightened alert jun 21 dining in singapore 15042426 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: Singapore will continue its gradual reopening in Phase 3 (Heightened Alert) by easing restrictions from Monday (Jun 21), albeit not to the extent many were hoping for. The Government has adjusted the reopening plans following persistent unlinked cases in the community, as well as the emergence of a large COVID-19cluster linked to 115 Bukit Merah View Market and Food Centre since restrictions were eased last Monday. Singapore will further relax measuresin mid-July, at a date yet to be announced, by allowing group sizes to increase to five, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) on Friday. Until then, here is a rundown of what is allowed, and what still is not, from next week. MAKAN KAKIS Dining-in will resume on Monday in groups of up to two people, instead of up to five as previously planned. This means groups of more than two people who are not from the same household cannot dine together at eateries, even if they are split across multiple tables. Members of the same household with more than two people will be allowed to split across multiple tables, but they must follow the rule of two. A group of six household members, for instance, will not be able to sit together as a table of six, said co-chair of the COVID-19 multi-ministry task force Lawrence Wong. “We allow people from the same household to have multiple tables, but they have to make very clear that they are from the same household, that is not new,” said Mr Wong. To reduce the risk of transmission from diners talking loudly, recorded music will not be allowed in eateries. This is on top of current restrictions on entertainment and safe distancing requirements. MASK-OFF INDOOR SPORTS Indoor sports with masks off can resume from Monday in groups of up to two people, and classes of up to 30 people at gyms and fitness studios. Both limits include the instructor. Masks can be taken off if an activity is strenuous, but must be worn once the activity ceases. People should have their masks with them at all times, said Sport SG. For mask-on indoor sports and outdoor sports with or without masks, the group size limit is five people and class size limit is 30 people, including the instructor. There must be safe distancing of at least 2m between individuals, and at least 3m between groups. Common equipment can be provided. VISITS TO ELDERLY CARE HOMES Visits to elderly residential care homes will resume, but visitors must take an antigen rapid test (ART) and test negative before they can enter. \"We seek the patience and understanding of visitors that some Homes may require more time to put in place the necessary procedures for ART and will only be able to resume visits at a later date,\" said the Ministry of Health (MOH). MORE RELIGIOUS ACTIVITIES Non-congregational religious activities, such as religious classes and pastoral services, can resume from Monday in gatherings of not more than 50 people. More elements of live music performance, such as singing and playing of wind or brass instruments, will be allowed for congregational and other worship services and religious rites. Up to two people can be unmasked for singing and playing of these instruments, out of the 10 allowed to unmask in a group of up to 30 people. For recording and broadcasting of religious services, a bigger group of up to 30 people – up from 15 – is now allowed on location. MORE ARTS AND CULTURE ACTIVITIES Arts and culture activities with masks off can resume in groups of up to two people from Monday. This largely applies to singing and the playing of instruments that require intentional expulsion of air, such as wind instruments. For live performances, up to two people can be unmasked for these purposes, out of the 10 performers who can be unmasked. A maximum of 30 performers and crew will be allowed on stage and backstage. These limits also apply for digital productions. Arts and culture classes, lectures, talks and workshops for people aged 18 and below can also resume. Unmasking will be allowed in classes for dance, singing, wind instruments, voice training and speech and drama. NO WATER PARKS, CAMPING OR BARBECUES All water play areas, water recreational facilities, campsites and barbecue pits in parks and gardens managed by the National Parks Board remain closed until further notice. Enforcement will be stepped up at other identified hotspots, including parks, beaches and common areas of public housing estates like hardcourts, basketball courts and pavilions. NO WEDDING RECEPTIONS No wedding receptions can be held until Singapore eases restrictions further in mid-July. This is because wedding risks are higher-risk activities where guests tend to socialise more and over a longer period of time, said MOH.

       " {'text': \"singapore covid 19 vaccination rate not high enough phase 3 15041028 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: Singapore’s vaccination rates are currently “still not high enough” to provide sufficient protection in the population, said co-chair of the COVID-19 multi-ministerial task force Lawrence Wong on Friday (Jun 18). Speaking at a press conference, he noted the views of some people who think that since COVID-19 could be endemic, Singapore should proceed with easing measures as planned and “not overreact to each and every new cluster”. “I can understand the sentiments behind this, and indeed, we do want to proceed with our reopening more confidently,” said Mr Wong. “But our vaccination rates currently are still not high enough to provide sufficient protection.” It was announced on Friday thatunder Singapore's two-step approach to reopening, dining-in and other higher-risk activities will resume on the target date of Jun 21 -but in groups of two instead of five as previously planned. The adjustment in planscomes amid a persistentnumber of unlinked COVID-19 cases, with authorities noting a large clusteraround 115 Bukit Merah View Market and Food Centre. “Regrettably, we are unable to proceed with our second stage of reopening in light of the latest outbreaks and big cluster that we have discovered in Bukit Merah, and now we have to adjust our plans,” said Mr Wong. ROLE OF VARIANTS There is also the view that Singapore should push back its reopening to a much later date until COVID-19 cases areconsistently near-zero for many days, noted Mr Wong, who is also the Finance Minister. “This is in fact very hard to achieve, and may not even be possible to do so, given how transmissible that Delta variant is,” he said. “And if we were to take this approach, it will mean we have restrictive measures in place for many months, which will cause many businesses to fold. So that's not a very realistic option.” Forty-nine per cent of the population have taken their first doses of vaccination, and “slightly over” 35 per centare fully vaccinated with both doses, Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said on Friday at the same press conference. As of Jun 15, more than 4.7 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccination have been administered in Singapore, he added. More than 2.7 million people have received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. “And that's not high enough, particularly the full vaccination rates. Our vaccine coverage for the vulnerable groups, the elderly, it's not bad. It's certainly above 60 per centbut still not high enough, especially for those who are above 70 years old. We would like it to be much higher in order to protect our vulnerable groups,” said Mr Wong. “So if we were to ease our restrictions too early, big clusters can easily break out and overwhelm us and result in higher hospitalisationand even mortality for the vulnerable groups. That's exactly what we are worried about.” Other countries are facing similar situations. The UK decided to push back its timeline for reopening because of the same concerns, he added. “And that's why we are not adopting either approach. Instead, we are treading a very careful path forward based on a rigorous assessment of our current situation,” said Mr Wong. “Hence, we have decided to break up the reopening into two steps. And our main objective with this stage of reopening is to buy time so that we can continue to speed up our vaccination programme.” F&B outlets and gyms cannot be “opening and closing in tandem” with the number of COVID-19 infections and clusters, said Mr Ong. “But for us to adopt that approach, our vaccination rates will have to be higher so that all of us are better protected,” he added. “It will go higher in the coming weeks, and we are vaccinating as fast as we can … We have the capacity to do a lot more, but we are constrained by supplies and how many vaccines arrive in Singapore,” said Mr Ong. “So without higher vaccination rates, the infection numbers will still matter because higher infections can lead to more severe illnesses, especially amongst those who are more vulnerable.” Downloadourappor subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

       " {'text': 'covid 19 defences vaccination singapore circuit breaker response 15047652 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: Thedefence capabilitiesbuilt over the past year have enabled Singapore to no longer need a \"circuit breaker\" to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, allowing most businesses to stay open and for people to carry on with their daily lives, said Health Minister Ong Ye Kung on Saturday (Jun 19). In a Facebook post, Mr Ong shared that \"slightly more\" than 50 per cent of the population hadreceived their first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. About 36 per cent hadreceived both doses. More than 4.8 million COVID-19 vaccine doses have been administered, according to the Ministry of Health (MOH). More than 2.8 million people have received the first dose, 2 million of which have received their second dose. Mr Ong said he was \"happy\" with the update, though he expressed the need to \"push it up further\". He noted that there was \"increasing consensus\" among experts that COVID-19 will likely be endemic. \"Fortunately, we have built up our capabilities over the past year. We can now test, contact trace and isolate very quickly. We have also vaccinated a good part of our population. \"With these defences in place, I believe we are able to put the circuit breaker as a response behind us, and able to keep most businesses open, carry on with our daily lives,\" he said. However, \"to go further\" and keep F&B businesses and gyms open as well as resume travel, \"our vaccination rate has to be higher\", said Mr Ong. \"We can then be better protected, even if the virus is circulating in the community,\" he added. Echoing a point made at the COVID-19 multi-ministry task force press conference on Friday, the Health Minister said Singapore is vaccinating as fast as possible but the vaccination rate is constrained by supplies due to high global demand. \"We will do our best to confirm the delivery of more vaccine to open up more slots, as early as possible,\" he said. Mr Ong also encouraged people to get vaccinated when it is their turn to do so, as well as encourage their friends and family members to do the same. The COVID-19 task force announced on Friday several changes to the upcoming reopening measures due to a persistent number of unlinked cases, as well as a large cluster around 115 Bukit Merah View Market and Food Centre. From Jun 21, dining in at F&B outlets will resumein groups of up to two people, instead of five as previously planned. “Regrettably, we are unable to proceed with our second stage of reopening in light of the latest outbreaks and big cluster that we have discovered in Bukit Merah, and now we have to adjust our plans,” said co-chair of the task force, Finance Minister Lawrence Wong, on Friday.

Currently, travellers from Israel must spend the entirety of their 21-day stay-home notice at a dedicated facility. Given the improving situation in Israel, travellers who have remained in the country for 21 days before arriving in Singapore will be allowed to spend the last seven days of their 21-day stay-home notice at a place of residence or self-sourced accommodation, said MOH. This measure will take effect fortravellers from Israel who arrive in Singapore from11.59pm on Jun 16. The Health Ministry on Monday also updated Singapore\\'s border measures for travellers from Fiji. \"Given the worsening situation in Fiji, we will be tightening border measures for travellers from Fiji\" with immediate effect, said MOH. All travellers who have spent time in Fiji in the 21 days before arriving in Singapore will be required to serve a 21-day stay-home notice at a dedicated facility. Prior to this, travellers from Fiji were allowed to spend the last seven days of their stay-home notice at a place of residence or self-sourced accommodation. \"Travellers who have not completed their 14-day stay-home notice at dedicated stay-home notice facilities by 11.59pm on Jun 16, will be required to serve the additional seven days at their current dedicated stay-home notice facility,\" MOH said. These travellers will be contacted regarding the additional costs to be paid, the Health Ministry added. Travellers who are currently serving their stay-home notice at a place of residence or self-sourced accommodation will be required to complete their 21-day stay-home notice at their current location to minimise movement and risk of transmission, said MOH. All travellers serving a 21-day stay-home notice will undergo COVID-19 polymerase chain reactiontests on-arrival, on Day 14 of their stay-home notice and before the end of their 21-day stay-home notice period.

These vaccines are the same as the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines that we have been using in our national vaccination programme, with the same research name BNT162b2.” These vaccines are manufactured according to the same processes and procedures, and meet the same finished product specifications as the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines. MOH added that the vaccines are similarly manufactured in Europe and shipped directly to Singapore. “The only difference is in their label,” said MOH. The Health Ministry added that it will be adjusting the HealthHub records of individuals who have received or will be receiving the Pfizer-BioNTech or Comirnaty vaccine to “administratively reflect” the vaccine received under a category called “Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty”. Pfizer announced in December last year that its Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine will be marketed in the European Union under the brand name Comirnaty. The brand name represents a combination of the terms COVID-19, mRNA, community, and immunity, to highlight the first authorisation of a messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine, the company said in a statement. Comirnaty received conditional marketing authorisation from the European Commission on Dec 22forthose aged 16 years and older. It was also the first COVID-19 vaccine to receive regulatory approval in Australia for individuals aged 16 and above.

       " {'text': 'british boy singapore cancer acute lymphoblastic leukaemia nuh 15085244 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners A year after Oscar Saxelby-Lee left Singapore following a life-saving experimental treatment at the National University Hospital, CNA spoke to his family to find out how he’s still conquering the odds. “He just does not give up.” SINGAPORE: When five-year-old British boy Oscar Saxelby-Lee came to Singapore in November 2019, he was staring death in the face. With his body wrecked by an aggressive form of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, all treatment in the UK had failed and his parents were told to prepare for the worst. But after undergoing an experimental treatment at the National University Hospital (NUH) in Singapore, he was declared cancer free. Cautious belief - the leukaemiahad returned after treatment before - turned to relief as he was allowed to be discharged and returned home. A year after leaving Singapore, Oscar, who\\'s now seven,is still free of the disease. “It has been a bit of a roller coaster,” his mum Olivia told CNA from England. “The minute we got off the plane, it was a real hit to us - it was as if we were entering another world of the unknown. “Since we’ve been back … Oscar is just thriving and he’s doing really well. I mean, he’s defying the odds every single day. We are just living day by day ... he is a miracle.” The journey has not been as easy. More than a year of treatments, isolation, and transfusions took a heavy toll on Oscar. Left with brain damage, tremors and difficultywalking, the little boy has since met many milestones in the last year – from going back to school, walking without help, and seeing his 7th birthday. It is easy to take these things for granted, explained Olivia, but for her and Oscar’s father Jamie, these milestones represent victories. STARING DEATH IN THE FACE Oscar was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in December 2018. Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia starts in the bone marrow and invades the blood rapidly. Within hours, he started treatment. Intense chemotherapy treatments failed. Radiotherapy failed. A stem cell transplant failed - the cancer would rear its ugly head each time. When they heard about the experimental treatment in Singapore, they made plans to fly over. The treatment was so new, it was not even in the medical trial stage yet. Oscar was allowed to have it on compassionate grounds - it was clear he would die without trying. By the time he arrived in Singapore, Oscar had spent 10 months in isolation in hospitals. He had lostweight and struggled to walk – he developed bruises on his legs from the strain of doing so. While the treatment killed the cancer cells, it also left him with brittle bones. He used a walker to get around, struggled to do small movements - his body was wrecked with tremors - and suffered brain damage. It left Oscar weak, frustrated and tired, but still smiling. “He’s had an extortionate, an incredible … amount of treatment that has knocked him. He was really poorly,” Olivia said. “He lost all mobility, lost all his strength –the physical, primary needs to eat, sleep, feed – he wasn’t capable of doing that alone. “I know at such a young age of six, it was very difficult. Physically … he had lost it all.” “CLIMBED MOUNTAINS” The recovery has been tough: Months of physiotherapy work, day after day of small steps that left Oscar exhausted, and motor movements with his hands to build up his strength. For Oscar’s parents, watching him improvewas a small miracle. “He has come on huge ... he has climbed mountains, reach the peak and jumped them from one to another,” said Olivia, laughing. “That’s how I would simplify it. He isn’t just surviving now, he’s living. At one point when we arrived home it was just survival … we’ve been through so much, we didn’t know how he would respond to a normal life. “He’s doing really, really well in that perspective.” Going back to school was a huge milestone for Oscar. Starting with a few hours, he now has dedicated help at school to help him settle back in. There is a sense of joy and excitement when Olivia talked about Oscar walking without help. “Walking is another extreme, because he couldn’t walk when he arrived in Singapore. He couldn’t walk properly, and now he’s running,” she said. “Well, he’s running as much as he can - he’s tottering around and he’s really going for it - he’s just loving life.” Watching him kick a football was a huge step: “I haven’t seen him with a football since he was about four years old.” But while children of Oscar’s age have seemingly boundless energy, Oscar knows there are limits. He is very aware of his own limitations, explained Olivia, and that plays “a huge part” in Oscar’s insecurities. “Some days he can get really upset because there’s still a lot that is asked of him,” she explained. While Oscar tries to take it on the chin, the years of seclusion have made things difficult. But having fought through cancer, there was almost no chance of Oscar giving up. “He really does have an ethic in life where he just keeps going, he doesn’t give up, and that inspires us as parents, and me, as a mother, every single day. So many other people are so proud of him. “It’s just been great to watch him improve and develop. \"On the outside, he looks like a growing, thriving little boy but on the inside, he’s really suffering.” Jamie and Olivia have to insert needles in Oscar’s legs four nights aweek for 12-hour infusions, and he still takes medication to help with his neurotoxicity. Beating cancer doesn’t mean an end to hospital appointments, checkups and needles. Over the last year, he developed a kidney stone that needs to be removed, he has undergone numerous eye checks, and suffered a vertebral fracture. There were still bone marrow aspirations and lumbar punctures, and because of his lowered bone density, falling down is a lot more serious for Oscar. All these conditions force back Oscar’s desire to run around and play, his mother explained, and that sometimes leaves the boy tired and despondent. NO HUGS AMID COVID-19 The COVID-19 pandemic also means sometimes, only one parent can be in hospital with Oscar. With a weakened immune system and the threat of COVID-19, it has been a difficult year. “He’s such a cuddly loving boy. He senses through touch a lot, and every time he leaves his teacher in the morning, he’s giving her a cuddle, and he does that to the nurses and ... the doctors,” said Olivia. “It’s become a really difficult part of Oscar’s journey, even now, because he really does search for that need and that response from other people who are caring for him, who are having that bond with him. “That is just a small part of how COVID-19 has impacted us as a family.” THERE IS NO FINISH LINE But while Oscar has come on in leap and bounds, caring for him has sometimes taken a toll on his parents. From the round-the-clock care to financial woes, the problems seem never ending. “When you’ve been through such a journey, there is no end to it, so there is no finish line. It’s still ongoing, and it will keep going for … I don’t dare to think,” Olivia added. It could be a simple thing as a viral infection, or Oscar falling over, and the stress builds up over time, she explained. Olivia has started playing netball one night a week, but even that is sometimes difficult for her. “You feel like you’re escaping and you’re not facing (up to it), and for me … I try to face reality, understand it and then adapt from it, so you can prioritise,” she said. “Some days it might be a different way of coping and other days, it is the opposite. It’s quite hard, because we are in the midst of it, and we’re just babies in learning how to cope.” Being away from Oscar, even for a short while, can be difficult for his parents. While the baby steps he is taking are growing into bigger steps, as Olivia described them, there are still many hurdles in front of him. She finds solace in helping other families who are in similar situations as Oscar’s. “He has been a huge inspiration to other children and lots of other families,” Olivia said. “(Some of these) children are just fighting their own demons and just trying to pull through, and it’s difficult - for them and their parents.” They have received messages from different families who have gone through similar journeys as Oscar’s and some of them have not seen the same outcomes. But watching Oscar’s daily fights to do the seemingly simple things is his parents’ “biggest inspiration”. “It is not just that he is cancer free. It’s that he just does not give up. There’s nothing that you could come across that would stop him from prospering.” GOING BACK TO SINGAPORE COVID-19 has made it difficult for Oscar and his family to travel, but they are “missing” the team from NUH “so much”. Olivia said the family is in contact with the medical team at the hospital. “We can’t wait to come back (to Singapore),” Olivia added. “Our heart and soul went into Singapore, and the team at NUH and the professors there. You know, for us, that’s our security now … Singapore, for us, for Oscar, is the biggest most important security (net) for him. “We really need to go back as soon as we can. We’re hoping that it won’t be too long away … we can’t wait to explore it, and do it properly.” Associate Professor Allen Yeoh, who was part of the NUH team who treated Oscar when he was in Singapore, told CNA that they are continuing to keep in close contact with hisfamily. \"We have been monitoring Oscar’s progress since his CAR-T cell therapy at (NUH), and are greatly heartened to see that he is doing well following treatment,\" said Assoc Prof Yeoh, who is the head and senior consultant of the Division of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology at NUH. Oscar goes home after treatment in Singapore (June 2020): Olivia is under no illusion of the fight that lies in front of her and her family. “I never want anybody to go through what we’ve been through,” she said. “It really hurts, and you have to dig deep, but for … myself, it helps (me) find purpose in life. It helps you see things from a totally different perspective. “Oscar … looking at my own child, my own son, every single day is a reminder that this is my life. This is my meaning, this is what I’m here for. That’s what keeps us going.” It looks like the email address you entered is not valid. Copyright© Mediacorp 2021. Mediacorp Pte Ltd.

Twenty-two of the cases were linked toMINDSville@Napiri Adult Disability Home in Hougang. They were all quarantined prior to detection, said the Ministry of Health (MOH). Among the remaining 13 new community infections reported on Thursday, 12were linked to previous cases, said MOH. There were also 10 new imported cases on Thursday, all of whom were placed on stay-home notice upon arrival in Singapore. Among the imported cases were four Singaporeans and apermanent resident who returned from India. Five imported cases are work permit holders who arrived from Indonesia, Malaysia and Myanmar, of whom three are foreign domestic workers. No new cases were reported in migrant workers\\' dormitories. In all, Singapore reported 45 new COVID-19 cases on Thursday. This is the highest daily case count since May 16, whenSingapore entered Phase 2 (Heightened Alert)following a spike in community cases. 3 VACCINATED NURSING AIDES TEST POSITIVE MOHsaid in its daily update on Wednesday that the 22 cases would be added to Thursday\\'s case count after their test results were verified. There are currently a total of 27 cases linked to the MINDSville@Napiri cluster. Three of the cases that were reported on Thursday work as nursing aides at the home. Theywere detected from proactive testing of staff members working inthe home. The three caseswere fully vaccinated. One was asymptomatic while the other two cases developed symptoms after they were tested for COVID-19. Nineteen of the other cases linked toMINDSville@Napiri are residents who had already been quarantined. They are all asymptomatic and were also detected from the Health Ministry\\'s testing of residents at the home. Among them, 17 had already been vaccinated. All of the residents and employees at the home were tested after a resident was confirmed to have COVID-19 on May 31. Co-chair of the COVID-19 multi-ministry task force Lawrence Wong earlier on Thursday said that the authorities were “very concerned” about hidden coronavirus cases in the community. He noted the recent outbreak at the MINDSville@Napiri Adult Disability Home was a \"stark reminder of this\". NEW CLUSTER IN BLOCK 506 HOUGANG AVENUE 8 A new cluster comprising 13 cases has been identified at Block506 Hougang Avenue 8. Twelve previously confirmed cases have been linked to this cluster.

       " {'text': 'cinema covid open rules watch movie film stream netflix disney 15090008 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners Cinemas have had it bad with curbs on audience sizes but there’s little to doubt we will fly back once it’s safe to again, says Nikki Draper of NTU Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information. SINGAPORE: Predicting the future of cinemas in the middle of a pandemic can be dicey. If travel bubbles closing before they open has taught us anything, it’s a lesson about uncertainty. Full disclosure: I am a streaming enthusiast, with a deep love for television. I appreciate how streaming and cable TV filled a gap and satisfied a need in a pandemic-ridden 2020. Stuck at home, people turned to them for distraction and found ways to connect with friends and family. But our entertainment options were artificially restricted due to our circumstances. What happens when we have full choice again? The situation for cinemas in Singapore and globally is concerning. The challenges aren’t small. CINEMA AS THE COMMON COMMUNAL EXPERIENCE Whether or not movie theatres exist post-pandemic will be shaped by the answers to structural questions not in the control of the average person: First, how governments invest in cinemas and the businesses they interact with. Second, how studios release films once theatres can fill their seats. Public policy and government assistance will be key to recovery for culture industries, including cinemas. In September 2020, the OECD published a report looking at COVID-19’s impact globally on culture industries and making a case for the importance of creative sectors in cities’ economic footprint and employment. Two things struck me. First, cinemas are included in the same category of venue-based arts sectors impacted by social distancing measures as museums and live-performance spaces – places countries are inclined to preserve given their cultural value to communities. Including cinemas in this group acknowledges the worth of that shared experience of watching movies in social spaces. That recognition is a good foundation that justifies public assistance. This is especially true in Singapore, which has one of the world’s highest per capita movie attendances, a whopping 18.5 million in 2019 that plummeted to 4.6 million in 2020, according to the Singapore Film Commission. It looks like the email address you entered is not valid. That’s a big and scary drop. Some of it is surely due to the attendance cap imposed for safety. It’s no wonder cinema operators lamented when Singapore added restrictions for cinema halls in mid-May. But the decent numbers last year suggest the audience appetite is there. WHEN CINEMAS CLOSE, THE OTHER BUSINESSES IMPACTED The second important takeaway from the OECD report is how cultural industries operate within an ecosystem. If we let our cinemas disappear, this will impact other businesses. What could that look like locally? Singapore has 274 cinema outlets. Closing these purpose-built venues would impact commercial real-estate. These venues also have projection equipment and sound systems that require servicing. Local distributors and programmers are responsible for identifying, negotiating terms and acquiring films for cinema houses. Local promotion requires marketing, design, website coding and integration of secure online banking and credit card services. Our cinemas are primarily situated in malls with other stores and F&B outlets. What happens when shopping centres don’t have that foot traffic? Many local film festivals, like the Singapore International Film Festival, partner with Singapore cinemas. If we lose those screening spaces, we will almost certainly lose some festivals and the regional and independent films they showcase. Currently, the Singapore Government appears inclined to preserve cinemas until the retail, arts and culture industries can adjust to the new normal. They’ve included cinema operators and their employees in the Jobs Support Scheme. THE RISE AND RISE OF STREAMING The second structural factor that will influence Singapore’s cinema landscape post-pandemic are the decisions studios make about releasing films. Since the introduction of television, there has been a dilution of entertainment consumption – consumers have new choices over how they spend their time and dollars. The number of options has steadily grown - with streaming services the most recent competitor. Movie theatre attendance has steadily fallen or fluctuated in response to these challenges. One-off peculiarities have boosted attendance: A good year for quality films or event films like Marvel’s Avengers: End Game or Black Panther which became a social event. Streaming services experienced massive growth in 2020. But Netflix recently posted a loss of US$20 billion in market value after missing subscriber growth forecasts. The possible cause? The launch of Disney+ which claimed almost 9 million new subscribers in that same quarter. Add to that the fact that studios pushed back 2020 releases to 2021 and 2022 with hopes of theatrical premieres. Studios clearly view theatrical releases to be critical to their distribution strategies, even if they envision a larger role for streaming services. Studios might not have found their formula yet, but Disney+ and the Marvel Cinematic Universe are an interesting possibility of how they might use both platforms to their advantage. Studios use streaming services to make full use of their intellectual property through television series of backstories or intriguing plot lines expanded from their films. Subsequent films then incorporate the TV details, released in theatres, but eventually returning to the streaming service where everything lives as a collection. WHY WE WILL BE BACK IN NO TIME So the big question remains: Will people still want cinema experiences? Streaming has made inroads that will be hard for theaters to overcome. One obvious challenge is comfort. In my house, I have my favourite snacks, no one to block my view or interrupt with their phones, and can schedule watch parties with family. How can cinemas compete with that? What pleasure can I derive from watching a film in a theatre? One common argument is that the pleasure of cinemas is technical. Big screens and surround sound give us access to visual and aural quality not available at home. This is a favourite argument of major directors who say that their films are made for cinemas and that’s how they prefer we watch them. That is true to some extent. But, to me, technical quality is often not the most memorable aspect of watching in a theatre. The pleasure was in participating in a live audience, the thrill of being around other people moved in the same way you are at a film’s twists, sad moments and jokes. It’s our collective gasp when Thanos snaps his fingers in Avengers: End Game or when Spiderman disappeared in Avengers: Infinity War. We could say cinemas are part of an experience economy that go beyond service delivery. These shared emotions connect us in that specific moment and place, creating something unique that adds to our enjoyment of a film. There’s no doubt cinemas and streaming compete for our attention. But cinemas are still relevant, especially now. If you don’t believe me, wait until cinemas can reopen with fewer restrictions on crowds. Most of us will be back in no time.

NEW CLUSTER LINKED TO ENGINEER Another new cluster comprising an unlinked community case and two linked community cases was identified on Sunday. The unlinked case, Case64184, wasa 27-year-old Indian engineer working at Ecoxplore. He was tested for COVID-19 on Jun 10 as part of rostered routine testing. He developed fever that same day. The man\\'s pooled test result came back positive on Jun 11, and an individual test confirmed his infection on Jun 12. His serology test was negative.

Among the 80 confirmed cases reported from Jun 7 to Jun 13,44 casestested positive for their serology tests, 27 tested negativeand nine serology test results were pending. PHASED EASING OF COVID-19 CURBS FROM JUN 14 Singapore will move to Phase 3 (Heightened Alert) in two steps from Monday after a fall in the number of COVID-19 community cases, said MOH on Jun 10. The limit on group sizes for social gatherings will be increased from two to five people from Monday.Similarly, five distinct visitors per household daily will be allowed. More restrictions will be eased in the second stepfrom Jun 21, when dining in can resume if the COVID-19 situation remains under control in the coming week. As of Sunday, Singapore has reported 62,276COVID-19 cases and 34 fatalities.

       " {'text': 'covid 19 breath test breathonix nus singapore lung cancer 14971406 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: When COVID-19 hit Singapore early last year, local start-up Breathonix had to stop all its clinical trials for its lung cancer breathalyser test due to pandemic restrictions. The company\\'s CEO Dr Jia Zhunan had been working on a way to detect disease from a person\\'s breath since her days as a doctoral student. But although tests for lung cancer detection had to stop, the firm soon found a newpurpose - a breath test for COVID-19. It was a \"natural\" switch because no other clinical trials were allowed at the time, and there was a lot of interest in a quick way to detect the highly infectious coronavirus,said Breathonix\\'s business development and strategy headWayne Wee. \"The technology, the hardware, even the know-how is the same,\" the 26-year-old told CNA.\"It\\'s just collecting a different set of data.\" On May 24, Breathonix announced that its COVID-19 breath analysis system was the first to secure provisionalauthorisation in Singapore. This came a week before Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said in a national address that COVID-19testing must be done “faster, and more liberally and extensively”. Many different tests have become available, such as antigen rapid tests (ART), saliva tests andbreathalysers, Mr Lee noted then, adding thatDIY tests will also be sold at pharmacies. TRIALS SPEEDED UP Breathonixis supported by the National University of Singapore’s (NUS) Graduate Research Innovation Programme. Around mid-2020, the company started a small study with the National Centre of Infectious Diseases (NCID), and the accuracy was high enough for them to expand it to a larger trial. As with many innovations linked to COVID-19, what might have taken three years or more was then compressed into one year - with clinical trials and regulatory approvals speeded up. And the firm did it all on a budget of less than S$1 million, said Mr Wee. \"It was quite a steep learning curve for us - (as it was our)first time doing all these things ...we tried to seek consulting help from NUS. And if that\\'s not enough, we had to source for or hiresome experts to join the team,\" he added. They also had a lot of help fromstakeholders like the Ministry of Health and NCID, said Mr Wee. Rather than having a swab thrust up your nose,a COVID-19 test using the company\\'s BreFenceGo COVID-19 breath test system takes just one breath. The exhaled breath then passes into a mass spectrometer, and the breath is analysed forvolatile organic compounds (VOC) or biomarkers that indicate COVID-19 infection. The trick, says Mr Wee, is to figure out what VOCs to look for and what to ignore. For example, smokers or people who have consumed alcohol would emit certain VOCs, which the analysis would omit. It currently has an accuracy of 85.7 per centsensitivity and 97 per centspecificity - correctly identifying those without the disease. Clinical trials are ongoing with an algorithm with artificial intelligenceto further improve accuracy. The World Health Organization(WHO) recommendsa sensitivity of 80 per centand specificity of 97 per centfor rapid antigen tests (ART), while the gold standard for COVID-19 tests remains the polymerase chain reaction or PCR test. Both ART and PCR tests require nasal swabs.While ART tests can produce results in 30 minutes, it may take a day for PCR tests. \"LESS THAN A SECOND TO PROCESS\" According to Mr Wee, their breath test takes only 40 to 60 seconds,which eliminates the need for a holding area while people wait for test results. \"Once we capture the data from the breath, the analysis of our own algorithm takes less than a second to process ...We are able to give the results in real-time to the person on the spot,\" he said. \"If you\\'retested negative, you are cleared to go ... If you\\'re tested positive, you will be redirected to take the PCR test and then you\\'ll be isolated or quarantined.\" Another advantage is that the testcan be conducted by trained non-medicalstaff members. A pilot deployment at Tuas Checkpoint started on May 31 and is still ongoing. The machine isplaced at different locations at the checkpoint to see if it issuited for use in such an environment. For example, the teamthought that strong winds orcar fumes may affect the test results, butthe performance so far has been \"quite promising\", said Mr Wee. Beyond Singapore, Breathonix is looking at other countries, including Malaysia and Vietnam, for more trials. It has alreadyconducted trials at Changi Airport, as well as in Dubai, and are seeking approval in the United Arab Emirates. It hopes to get full approval from Singapore\\'s Health Sciences Authority by the end of the year. Each test costs US$5 to US$20, depending on the volume of the deployment, which is much cheaper than PCR tests, said Mr Wee. It is thus useful for venues with high traffic like large events, schools, worker dormitories or workplaces where routine testing is done. \"Our bigger vision is really to make breath tests (an) annual screening tool for every single individual,\" said Mr Wee. \"On top of doing a blood test and othertests, you also do a breath test, where we are able to detect andidentify if you are at risk of any disease ... such as lung cancer, nose cancer, tuberculosis, maybe even flu.\" Downloadourappor subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

       " {'text': 'covid 19 community cases singapore moh jun 12 14999480 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: Singapore reported nine new COVID-19 infections in the community as of noon on Saturday(Jun 12), including five with no links to previous cases. Four were linked to previous cases, with three already in quarantine and one detected through surveillance, said the Ministry of Health (MOH). The ministry had earlier reported 12 community infections, but it said in its latest update that three cases were negative for COVID-19 upon further tests. ION ORCHARD CLEANER TESTS POSITIVE A cleaner at ION Orchard, which has been shut for four days for deep cleaning, is among the five unlinked cases. The 45-year-old Chinese national is employed by Hong Ye Group. She is asymptomatic and her infection wasdetected when she went for a COVID-19 test directed by her employer. MOH had announced on Friday that all staff and tenants who worked at the ION Orchard from May 28 to Jun 11 must be tested after three cases were linked to the mall. OTHER UNLINKED CASES The remaining four unlinked cases are a student at SIM Global Education, a foreign domestic worker from Myanmar, a land rigger at Jurong Port and a landscape gardener. The SIM Global Education student, an 18-year-old Singaporean, was last in school on May 24. She developed a runny nose and fever on Thursday and sought medical treatment at a clinic on Friday when she was tested. The Myanmar maid, 27, hada fever on Thursday and went to a clinic on Friday. The land rigger at Jurong Port is a 57-year-old Malaysian man who is fully vaccinated.He is asymptomatic and his infection was detected on Thursday through rostered routine testing. He was immediately isolated when his antigen rapid test (ART) result was positive. His PCR test came back positive for COVID-19 on Friday. His Ct value was very high, which is indicative of a low viral load. Another test taken on Saturday came back negative, said MOH. \"He is likely to be shedding minute fragments of the virus RNA, which are no longer transmissible and infective to others, but we have taken all necessary public health actions,\" the ministry added. The remaining unlinked infection involves a 68-year-old Singaporean man who works as a landscape gardener at Amozonia Landscape. He developed a runny nose and cough on Tuesday and sought treatment at a clinic on Friday. He has also been vaccinated against COVID-19. NEW TUGBOAT CLUSTER A new cluster has been identified after two more workers on board tugboat Marina Ariel tested positive for COVID-19. They were both identified as a workplace contact of Case 64149, whotested positive on Friday. The two new cases - 64180 and 64181 - are Indonesian men aged 40 and 38, respectively. Both developed a cough and fever before they were quarantined but did not seek medical attention. They were placed on quarantine on Friday, after being identified as a workplace contact of the first case. They reported their symptoms on the same day and were taken to a hospital to be tested. OTHER LINKED CASES One casewas linked to a cluster involving household contacts of Case 63399, a kitchen crew member at Kota Zheng Zong Bak Kut Teh (Serangoon Gardens). Case 63399 tested positive for COVID-19 on May 17. The latest case in this clusteris a 35-year-old Malaysian woman who works as an administrative staff member at Ces Lamination. She was placed on quarantine on May 17. She developed a runny nose on Thursday during quarantine but did not report it until Friday. Another new case was detected through surveillance. She is an 82-year-old Singaporean woman who regularly helps out at a sundry store at 115 Bukit Merah View Market & Hawker Centre. She developed a fever and shortness of breath on Thursday and sought treatment at a polyclinic on Friday. She has been vaccinated against COVID-19. IMPORTED CASES There were also nine imported cases, taking Singapore\\'s daily count on Saturday to 18. They comprise six Singaporeans and three permanent residents who returned from India, Portugal, Russia, Thailand, the UK and the US. All of them were placed on stay-home noticeupon arrival in Singapore. Thirty-nine more COVID-19 cases have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities, taking the total recoveries to61,838. There are 125 cases who are still in hospital, most of whom are stable or improving, with one in critical condition in the intensive care unit. Another 266 cases are isolated and cared for at community facilities. Overall, the number of new cases in the community has decreased from 129 cases in the week before to 32 in the past week, said MOH.Unlinked community cases have also decreased from 20 cases in the week before to 14 in the past week. Among the 87 confirmed cases reported from Jun 6 to Saturday, 46 cases have tested positive for their serology tests, 25 tested negative, while 16 are pending.

       " {'text': \"work from home wfh default jobs support scheme covid 19 15040560 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: Work-from-home will continue to remain the default, even as Singapore transitions through Phase 3 (Heightened Alert) in the coming weeks, announced the Ministry of Health (MOH) on Friday (Jun 18). For employees who need to be in the workplace,start times must be staggered and flexible working hours implemented. Workers should not be cross-deployed to multiple worksites. Workplaces are also not allowed to havesocial gatherings or serve food and beverages at work-related events, said MOH. Singapore moved into the first stage of Phase 3 (Heightened Alert) on Jun 14, after a fall in the number of COVID-19 community cases. More restrictions will be eased in the second stage from Jun 21, when dining-in at F&B outlets can resume in groups of two. EXTENDED SUPPORT MEASURES Measures such as the Jobs Support Scheme, which subsidises local workers' salaries, will be extended foraffected sectors. Businesses in sectors that were required to remain closed until Jun 20 were to receive50 per cent subsidy for these workers' wages until then, then 10 per cent until end-June. However, with some restrictions still in place after Jun 20, sectors such as F&B, gyms and fitness studios and performing arts will now receive 50 per cent subsidy for three weeks from Jun 21 to Jul 11.They will receive 10 per cent for two weeks starting from Jul 12. Sectors that are significantly affected, such as retail, cinemas and museums, will receive 30 per cent subsidy for three weeks then 10 per cent for two weeks. “We recognise that some businesses will be impacted and therefore, the Ministry of Finance will continue to extend the support measures,” said co-chair of the COVID-19 multi-ministrytask force Lawrence Wong at a press conference on Friday. “Regrettably, we are unable to proceed with our second stage of reopening in light of the latest outbreaks and big cluster that we have discovered in Bukit Merah, and now we have to adjust our plans,” he said. Hawkers who are self-employed will also receive rental waivers andsubsidies for fees for table cleaning and centralised dishwashing services, he said. This will apply to stallholders in centres managed by the National Environment Agency or appointed operators. For workers affected by the tighter measures, the COVID-19 recovery temporary grant will be extended to the end of July, Mr Wong said. Recipients of this grant can apply for a second round of support in July. More details will be announced later, said MOH. MANDATORY REGULAR TESTING FOR STAFF IN UNMASKED ACTIVITIES Staff who work in high-risk settings with unmasked customers, or where there is prolonged contact between individuals, will have to undergo a 14-day testing cycle from mid-July. The Government previously announced that people who work in these high-risk settings will have to go through regular COVID-19 testing, regardless of their vaccination status. This includes staff of dine-in F&B outlets, personal care and appearance services that require removal of masks such as facials, saunas and make-up services, and gym and fitness studios where clients are unmasked. “Most of such testing can be done through a system of self-swabs, by the employees themselves and supervised by the employers,” said Mr Wong. The Government will provide freetraining for the next three months to employers for self-swabbing. Antigen rapid test kits will also be made available to employers. Some F&B businesses have already sent their employees for training and are ready to implement regular testing progressively from Jun 21, MOH said. For small businesses unable to organise the supervised self-swabs on their own, their staff can get tested at Quick Test Centres. One centre will be set up at Tekka and another in Yishun, and both will begin operating on Jun 21. More centres will be set up later. The Government will also facilitate earlier vaccination of people who work in these settings to minimise COVID-19 transmission, MOH said.

Stage 2 is scheduled next Monday.Unfortunately we now have new cases breaking out and a major new cluster in Bukit Merah,\" said Mr Wong, who co-chairs thetask force. \"Given these developments, we are evaluating the timing and scope of the next stage of reopening. The MTF is studying the situation carefully with public health expertsand will provide further updates soon.\" As of Tuesday, theBukit Merah View Market and Food CentreCOVID-19 cluster consisted of 25 cases. In a video accompanying his Facebook post, Mr Wong said that the new COVID-19 cases in Bukit Merah are \"breaking out not only in the market and the hawker centre, but also, all around the vicinity\". \"And day by day, we are seeing the number of unlinked cases, the cryptic cases in the community are likely to be rising too,\" he said. The market, which was slated to reopen on Wednesday after being closed since Sunday, will now be shut for two weeks until Jun 26. Explaining the decision on Tuesday, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said that the detection of more cases among employees at the market and their close contacts suggests there is \"ongoing spread with wider transmission\". All staff and tenants who had been working at the market from May 25 were placed on quarantine, and will be tested during quarantine. All 85 tenants and workers of the neighbouring 116 Bukit Merah View have also been tested for COVID-19, whilefree COVID-19 testing has been extended to members of the public who had visited the shops at 115 and 116 Bukit Merah View between May 25 and Jun 12. Stallholders at Redhill Market and Food Centre, which is a short walk away from Bukit Merah View Market and Food Centre, will undergo mandatory swab tests after a COVID-19 case recently visited the market. \"I know this is a difficult time for everyone,\" Mr Wong said. \"I want to assure all of you that we are doing our very best to control the infection and we want to ensure that we do not have another flare-up before we reach sufficiently high levels of vaccination in our community.\" Dining-in at food and beverage outlets is currently banned as part of Phase 3 (Heightened Alert) and was scheduled to resume on Jun 21,provided the COVID-19 situation remained under control.

       " {'text': 'covid 19 information conspiracy theories pofma experts 15000026 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners Singaporeans are susceptible to misinformation related to health and medicine, according to studies. SINGAPORE: Mr Jake Goh, 51, a principal of a private preschool, does not mind it when people label him as a conspiracy theorist or an anti-vaccine advocate. “Whether I am a conspiracy theorist or not, time will tell. I’m not trying to argue with people, I’m just here to offer an alternative view. If they decide to let their children be jabbed, I can only warn them,” said Mr Goh. He runs two Telegram groups that discuss COVID-19 and vaccine injuries, each with thousands of members surfacing claims that the two authorised vaccines here — Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna — have caused serious side effects such as stroke. This is despite the fact that the Singapore Government has authorised the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for teens aged 12 to 15, with an expert committee and the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) assessing that the vaccine is safe and efficacious to use for this group. “You can gather a lot of knowledge from the Internet. Not everything the doctor says about vaccines is correct,” said Mr Goh. Mr Goh was not always so radical, having dutifully received flu jabs and other types of vaccines in the past. His transformation to become an anti-vaccine advocate began last year during the pandemic, after reading articles about the drug industrial complex behind cholesterol research. Nowadays, he gets his information from YouTubers who discuss health issues and have a wide following, as well as from health journals that he reads to \"get to the source\" directly. After all, newspapers can be biased, he claimed. His contrarian views have led to conflicts with people around him. His best friends removed him from their Facebook friends list because his anti-vaccine posts have become “too extreme” lately. His sister, who lives in France where some 110,000 people have died from COVID-19, often chides him for telling others not to get the jab when he has not seen firsthand how horrific the disease can become outside of Singapore. But he is immovable in his radical belief that COVID-19 vaccine development was rushed: “People say I believe in conspiracy theories, that I am an anti-vaxxer, that I am crazy. Oh yes, I get that a lot.” Mr Goh is not the only one who has been socially distanced this way during the pandemic. Artist Zelda, 34, has also seen her family ties and long-standing relationships strained or severed, as a result of her wild and unsubstantiated claims — such as one proclaiming that vaccines are part of a money-grubbing conspiracy by the “global public health mafia”. First, it was with her father, who reads the newspapers and has been fully vaccinated, and whom she often had heated arguments with. To her, official narratives from governments and experts obscure the truth, while alternative viewpoints from YouTube commentators deserve to be heard. Then, the fallout also spread to her close friends, whom she has known for decades, after she began sharing articles depicting COVID-19 as a lab-made bioweapon, and defending these articles when her friends challenged her. Sick of arguing whenever Zelda shares articles about such theories on their mutual chat groups, some of her childhood friends have since shut her out of their lives. She declined to give her full name. Wistfully, one of these friends said“She was always the first one to diffuse an argument. But now she believes so much in this that she’s willing to just abandon friends over it.” Zelda recounted how voicing out these “alternative facts” during the pandemic had caused people around her to blow a fuse. With her father, she no longer desires to discuss such theories at the dinner table. “We just say hello and good morning, that sort of thing. It’s much healthier this way.” Her information comes from dubious sources such as web streaming service Gaia, a paid service which hosts fringe content about alternative healing and conspiracies. The United States-based website features articles discouraging people to get vaccinated against COVID-19. On YouTube and Facebook, she would consume news from personalities who have been associated with alt-right conspiracies, such as David Wilcock and Ben Swann from the US. News from the mainstream media outlets are not part of her regular news diet, though some “research” for her wild theories come from legitimate scientific journals with her own interpretation of what it all means. “In this pandemic, it is quite sobering that the things that we believe in shape us, down to the relationships that we have,” she added, referring to how she is no longer on talking terms with some of her friends. As Singaporeans, and people elsewhere, suffer from an information overload regarding COVID-19 — where fact, fiction and half-truths abound — it takes patience and effort to engage people with strongly held beliefs that are based on falsehoods, said Ms Tin Pei Ling, Member of Parliament (MP) for MacPherson. “(They) could have good intentions too. But if one shuts them out completely, it means there are no more chances to give them the right facts, and does not give you the opportunity to understand each other better,” the chairperson of the government parliamentary committee for communications and information said. Amid the raging pandemic, misinformation about the virus has far more serious implications than just damaged ties between family and friends alone. If left unchecked, the scourge of malicious falsehoods and misleading half-truths could threaten to derail Singapore’s pandemic strategy, especially its national vaccination exercise that is still underway, experts specialising in infectious diseases, public communications, policy research or national security said. But along with this progress, the number of incidents involving misinformation has also increased lately, some noted. In the span of just a month, there were three incidents about coronavirus-related falsehoods in which Singapore’s fake news law, the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA), had to be invoked, starting from late April, noted Mr Ryan Lim, founding partner of digital management consultancy QED Consulting. In that time, Google searches on COVID-19 vaccines had spiked, he added. Presently, “Vaccine Singapore” is the top most searched term here. On Jun 8, Health Minister Ong Ye Kung acknowledged these issues playing out on social media that had cast doubt on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines, claiming that messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccines, such as those by Pfizer and Moderna, do not work. He was referring to a petition by 12 doctors, who had disagreed with the Government’s decision to roll out mRNA vaccines, and also discouraged parents from vaccinating their children. Eleven of the doctors later retracted their statement, and the authorities as well as a number of other infectious diseases experts were quick to respond to these vaccine claims. “In fighting a relatively unknown and mutating virus, we have to steer carefully, constantly learning to navigate better, and improving on our approaches and processes. That, the Multi-Ministry Taskforce is fully committed to doing,” Mr Ong said on Facebook. While the viral situation is under control in Singapore presently and the vaccination programme is on track, there is no telling what may come in the future when COVID-19 has become endemic, and when repeated booster shots could be needed then. Dr Shashi Jayakumar, head of S Rajaratnam School of International Studies’ Centre of Excellence for National Security (CENS), warned that the COVID-19 situation could very well turn critical again for Singapore. And if it does, and if trust in the state and institutions is shaken as a result, malicious rumours, falsehoods, half-truths and misinformation would be back to plague Singapore’s pandemic response once again. “We are starting from a good position now. But hypothetically, if there is wave after wave of infections, and lockdowns after lockdowns are needed, that would be the fertile ground for malicious misinformation to proliferate,” he said. FACT, FICTION AND THE UNKNOWN Tracing the roots of misinformation to their sources would likely reveal one of several motivations behind its spread: These include political and ideological reasons, commercial profit, mischief, but also cases of genuine misunderstanding, said experts. QED’s Mr Lim said: “Such false content tends to thrive in an environment with a high degree of anxiety and ambiguity. The successful spread will create a vicious circle that encourages more of such content to be created.” Such anxiety was the case at the beginning of the pandemic on Jan 23 last year, when Singapore announced its first imported case of the novel coronavirus, which originated in Wuhan, China. At a time when people were closely watching the developments in China, where several people had died from the new disease, a post by a user in the HardwareZone online forum claimed that a 66-year-old man had died from the virus on Jan 26. By then, Singapore had counted only its fourth confirmed case of COVID-19. This false claim by the user named Potato_salad was quickly dismissed by the authorities the next morning, when POFMA was used. The relatively new law had come into force only four months earlier. A general correction direction was issued to SPH Magazines, which operates the forum, to publish a correction notice to its Singapore users to inform them of the falsehood. To date, POFMA has been used in 14 separate instances concerning COVID-19-related falsehoods. But the amount of misinformation being spread during the pandemic is far more numerous than those flagged by the fake news law, which on its own, is insufficient to stop people from believing these claims, said experts. Associate Professor Alton Chua from the Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information at Nanyang Technological University said that while POFMA is designed to nip the spread of falsehood in the bud, it is no silver bullet when it comes to shaping beliefs. “Most falsehoods on the COVID-19 virus and vaccines that are swirling around are what is known as dread rumours. Unlike wish rumours which invoke hope and optimism, dread rumours spell doom and gloom,” he said. People can also suffer from confirmation bias, choosing to interpret information in a way that conforms to their existing beliefs, he said. That means that those who are sceptical about COVID-19 vaccines, for example, tend to exaggerate reports they come across about post-vaccination complications. “Hence, any dread rumours about COVID-19 vaccination will be uncritically lapped up. The mindset of ‘better be safe than sorry’ is ironically what compels these people to share untruths,” he said. Citing a recent small-scale research conducted by his graduate student, Assoc Prof Chua said a majority of respondents were averse to sharing misinformation related to COVID-19 because they were able to discern that the messages were of a dubious nature and that it would be unhelpful to share them with people. When probed further, POFMA did not emerge as a deterrent factor at all among the respondents, he added. “In the fight against online falsehood during this pandemic, information literacy and education remains an important anchor,” Assoc Prof Chua said. (Are COVID-19 vaccines still effective against new variants? And could these increase the risk of reinfection? Experts explain why COVID-19 could become a “chronic problem\" on CNA\\'s Heart of the Matter podcast.) FAST-EVOLVING PANDEMIC CONDUCIVE FOR MISINFORMATION When it comes to COVID-19, however, the scientific nature of the coronavirus and vaccines renders it hard for people to make their own conclusions about the science. Thus, it is key that people can turn to experts with the right credentials and experience to help them sort fact from fiction. What makes this pandemic a perfect storm for misinformation to be reinforced and spread is because it concerns a new virus, fast-emerging viral strains, and cutting-edge vaccines that will take time to fully understand them. And with science still playing catch-up with an evolving disease, there is a danger that misinformation can fill in the void and could even foster mistrust of scientific methods. One common example cited by some conspiracy theoristswas Singapore’s insistence at the start of 2020 that face masks should be used only when a person was feeling unwell or showing symptoms. The guideline later changed to require face masks to be worn at all times, when scientists discovered the possibility of asymptomatic spread of COVID-19 and the World Health Organisation also switched its stance on face masks. To some, the episode meant that trusting one’s instincts is better than listening to what the authorities say. Zelda said she feels frustrated watching government officials speak about the safety measures needed: “I think they are trying their best. But as a human, do I need to rely on an external party for a decision about my own life? My answer is no.” Asked about this, Dr Carol Soon and Mr Shawn Goh from the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy said that a study they conducted last year had found that false information relating to health and medicine was second out of 11 topics that were most frequently believed by Singaporeans. Falsehoods about international and foreign affairs came out tops in the study. In an email interview, they said: “There may be two possible reasons for this. First, health misinformation is perceived to have a direct impact on people’s lives. Negativity bias is also at play as we are evolutionarily hardwired to respond more strongly to survival threats. “Second, navigating the online space for credible medical information requires not only digital literacy, but also scientific literacy, which many people may not possess sufficiently.” FALSEHOODS ON VACCINE SAFETY Dr Soon and Mr Goh warned that they have observed increasingly active forms of “online mobilisation” among people who circulate unverified information or mistruths about COVID-19 vaccine safety and its purported side effects. Examples include people making allegations that healthy individuals had experienced medical complications or died after receiving their vaccination, and sharing photos of severe rashes and swelling that they claim to be vaccine-induced. The HSA reported in May that out of the 2.2 million vaccine doses administered until mid-April 2021, there were 95 reports of serious adverse effects such as anaphylaxis, but no deaths have been linked to the vaccines so far. POFMA was used against opposition member Goh Meng Seng who had published several false statements implying that the vaccines had caused or substantially contributed to death or stroke. Despite these clarifications from the authorities, the unproven theory that vaccines lead to death continue to pervade the online space in Singapore. The IPS researchers noted that some people who engage in such content have come up with a range of strategies. “They include setting up Facebook groups to share misinformation, and creating Google forms to solicit stories and cases of vaccine injuries, often without the full context. Mobilisation is also taking place in closed-group platforms such as WhatsApp and Telegram. “The end-to-end encryption technology that undergirds instant messaging apps hinders timely misinformation detection and debunking,” they said. Their study had also noted that instant messaging platforms and social networking sites were the top two types of media where people most frequently encountered and believed in false information. Mr Jake Goh, the private preschool principal who runs one such group on Telegram, claimed that its purpose is to create awareness because “transparency is needed in public health”, so that the public can make an informed decision about vaccines. “We are filling the gap that the Ministry of Health and all the relevant authorities are not providing or not announcing,” he said. When asked if he or the other moderators of the platform curate the information shared in the Telegram group, Mr Jake Goh insisted that it is not possible for them to fact-check every post. “Yes, I am of course concerned if misinformation seeps into the group. So if they mention things like (Donald) Trump or Bill Gates, we will remove the posts. But there is no way the layman can know what is correct or not, so we have to learn from everywhere, and read widely. “We are just there as a sounding board to surface alternative views,” he said. He claimed that his vaccine scepticism is backed by his own research, having read through the trial data and reports of existing vaccines, and concluding that the vaccine trials were not thorough enough. On this, IPS’ Dr Soon and Mr Shawn Goh said that it is often the case that those who go the extra mile to look up information on vaccine efficacy may end up reinforcing their own beliefs. “Their false beliefs may be reinforced when they draw invalid conclusions from scientific studies without a full appreciation of their robustness, or if they turn to ‘scientific journals’ that are not actually recognised by the expert community,” they said. Referring to these online mobilisation efforts as well as the petition against mRNA vaccines by the 12 doctors, Dr Soon and Mr Shawn Goh added: “Without intervention, these online spaces allow anti-vaccine views to fester and gain perceived legitimacy as they grow in size.” ESTABLISHING LINKS BETWEEN VACCINES AND DEATHS: WHAT PUBLIC NEEDS TO UNDERSTAND When asked why scientists cannot categorically state that COVID-19 vaccines do not cause death in order to lay these mistruths to rest, experts stressed the importance in trusting the scientific method — that conclusions can only be reached after observations, experiments and measurements are done. Professor Teo Yik Ying, dean of the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, said that there is a clear difference between proof of absence and the absence of proof. Explaining, he said it is one thing to issue a statement such as “in all the participants in the clinical trials, we have not observed a death event”, as opposed to “this vaccine does not cause death in anyone who takes it”. “There is a need to systematically review the evidence of any mortality event that is suspected to be linked to the vaccine to understand whether taking the vaccine caused the fatality,” he added. “This mechanistic link is indeed a challenge to establish properly. This is why regulatory agencies worldwide, not just in Singapore, have been monitoring adverse events that are purportedly linked to the vaccines, so the data and knowledge can be accrued, shared internationally, and reviewed jointly, in order to understand the real-world impact of the vaccines.” Because proper science takes time, it thus falls to a close partnership among responsible scientists, responsible media and trusted public agencies to be agile in responding to fake news in the meantime, he said. All three parties are essential to this effort, since no single stakeholder holds all the cards needed to combat fake news. The media and fact-checking organisations, for example, do not have the complete information needed to deal with complex scientific problems, but they should have access to trusted experts and policymakers to distill the information for the public. This also means people should be wary of scientists who are not properly informed themselves, as well as irresponsible ones who could have been generating and spreading misinformation, said Prof Teo. “While (stopping the circulation of fake news) appears to be additional workload to people who may already be busy fighting the pandemic, it is just as important in the overall pandemic control, especially if the fake news will make people act or react in a certain way that causes harm to themselves or others in the community,” he stressed. ORCHESTRATED DISINFORMATION CAMPAIGNS Another aspect of misinformation concerns the threat of state-led disinformation campaigns, in the light of efforts by some countries to promote “vaccine diplomacy”. China, for example, is donating vaccines to regions where its competition with the US for influence is intense, reported Reuters news agency. The US has also announced its plans to donate 500 million doses of vaccines to the developing world, including in Asia. But could vaccine diplomacy also take on a more aggressive stance, such as by resorting to disinformation campaigns to discredit another country’s vaccine? Are such efforts already underway in Singapore? It is possible, though drawing a link between a falsehood and a state-originated disinformation campaign is difficult, said Ms Dymples Leong, a senior analyst at CENS. She noted that there has been misinformation revolving not just around vaccines in general, but also certain vaccines in particular. “One example (of misinformation) is the claim that mRNA-based vaccines are ineffective against COVID-19 variants, or claims which encourage people to support one vaccine over the other due to reasons such as vaccine nationalism,” said Ms Leong. On social media in recent weeks, comparisons of efficacy have been made between mRNA-based vaccines which are developed in Western countries, such as Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, and the virus vector and inactivated virus vaccines, such as Russia’s Sputnik V and China’s Sinovac and Sinopharm. Some doctors, including Dr Oon Chong Jin, a private cancer specialist who championed hepatitis B vaccination in Singapore, issued statements that circulated on social media claiming that inactivated virus vaccines such as Sinovac are more effective against COVID-19 variants, whereas mRNA-based vaccines were “useless” against these new strains. Dr David Lye, the director of infectious disease research at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases, rebutted these statements on Monday, stating that mRNA vaccines were the most effective against the variants and there were hardly any data about this for Sinovac. He also spoke out against doctors who “quote dubious international experts and research potentially misleading the public”. The expert committee on COVID-19 vaccination under the Ministry of Health has also refuted the online claims. It pointed out that Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines have in various studies “consistently shown to be highly efficacious, at around 90 per cent, especially in protecting against severe COVID-19 disease and hospitalisation”. These were demonstrated in various trials and actual roll-outs in the United States, United Kingdom and Israel. Emerging data continues to show that the mRNA vaccines are also effective against the B1617 variant. For instance, a study in the UK showed that two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine confer about 88 per cent protection against symptomatic COVID-19 even with the delta or B16172 variant. The term “vaccine nationalism” was also used by Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean, who is also Coordinating Minister for National Security, in a Facebook post last week. Vaccine nationalism was the top concern among volunteers at a meet-the-people session, and whether the competition among countries will cloud scientific and medical facts and what to believe amid all the noise that is suddenly being created, wrote SM Teo. He said in response to a Facebook user comment: “It is not West or East, but science and facts. The question is whether the data provided for evaluation is sufficient for HSA to clear it for general use by Singaporeans, to make sure it is safe for us and our families.” Asked whether vaccine geopolitics is at play in Singapore, CENS’ Dr Jayakumar said there is no doubt that vaccine diplomacy is now an important “calling card” of national soft power, so there are tensions whenever that soft power is being undermined. He said that messages of indeterminate origin have been bandied around on social media creating fear about certain vaccine types, though he agreed with Ms Leong that it is not easy to conclude that these are state-led efforts. Nevertheless, Singapore is also being closely watched for what vaccines it buys and uses for its national vaccination programme, he added. “Worldwide, we do see certain countries trying to burnish the credentials of certain vaccines. Around the edges of this issue is that Singapore is seen as an index customer, that we are not just any country but a country with acute judgement. “It is universally recognised that when we choose certain vaccines, questions may be asked as to why we did not choose another one,” said Dr Jayakumar. GREATER TRANSPARENCY, ENGAGEMENT THE ANTIDOTE? With such a wide spectrum of motivations behind the spread of misinformation, tackling pandemic falsehoods is a challenging task for any government, said experts. In the United Kingdom earlier this year, when it was facing a surge in COVID-19 cases caused by a mutant strain, the scourge of misinformation reared its ugly head during the country’s third national lockdown. Anti-vaccination and anti-lockdown protesters, as well as demonstrators who falsely believed that COVID-19 was a hoax, ended up picketing hospitals and verbally abusing exhausted doctors, teachers and other frontline workers, reported British news outlets. And in the US, misinformation about the origins of COVID-19 arguably contributed to a rise in hate crimes towards residents of Asian descent, prompting legislators to expedite a COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act aimed at stopping these attacks. This is why Singapore cannot ignore malicious falsehoods, lest they take hold in society, said those interviewed. Ms Tin, the MacPherson MP, said: “The Government is faced with the responsibility to contain and control the virus in the fastest time possible to reduce the damage to our people to the minimum possible. “After all, at the national level, if there are people who are spreading misinformation, discouraging people from receiving the vaccination or from complying with the safety rules, then you can imagine how much it will slow down our pandemic response or even derail it.” Fortunately, Singapore is not faring too bad when it comes to managing misinformation, said Assoc Prof Chua from the Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information. “When the vaccination programme in Singapore started early this year beginning with senior citizens, there was a palpable sense of apprehension. It didn’t help that there were cases of post-vaccination deaths reported overseas, albeit rare,” he recalled. But these myths were quickly dispelled through the mainstream media and with the help of infectious diseases experts, said Assoc Prof Chua. Television commercials and public service campaigns, some of which featured Gurmit Singh’s iconic Phua Chu Kang character, drove home the importance of vaccination. CENS’ Ms Leong pointed to the comic series “The Covid Chronicles”, by the National University of Singapore’s Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine and illustrator Andrew Tan, as a good example of explaining the science of Covid-19 in an engaging format.IPS’ Dr Soon and Mr Goh said of these efforts: “Effective communication of science is needed to build resilience against vaccine misinformation and foster public trust in science. “Public messaging should be clear and simple, for example by stating that vaccines are safe and effective, and highlighting scientific consensus on the matter helps inoculate people from being swayed by misinformation that claim otherwise.” Dr Jeremy Lim, from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, who often comments on public health policy, said he is sympathetic to those with alternative views. But he also noted that disagreements between doctors and professionals can still be cordial, agreeing to disagree. That said, transparency must also come from scientists, doctors, public health professionals too, considering that the nature of novel diseases means there will be limited data and experience to go by. “In public communications, it’s important to share views and recognise alternative ways of interpreting data, as well as be clear why one disagrees with certain points made,” said Dr Lim. While some may argue that alternative views have been shut out of the official narrative, Singapore’s public communications strategies by and large have allowed national vaccination take-up rate to maintain a healthy trajectory, said those interviewed. After all, the proof is in the pudding, they said. But at the individual level, when confronted with someone with wildly differing views that are based on falsehoods, Ms Tin urged people to not dismiss them and instead listen closely to their concerns. “Sometimes that can be very difficult to do and it can be an emotional experience,” said Ms Tin. “But we just have to try.” And sometimes, this endeavour pays off, as the experience of retired tuition teacher Mrs Chia W M, 68, shows. Speaking in Mandarin, she said thatfor the longest time, she did not want Western vaccines because YouTube videos had convinced her that they were more dangerous than the “traditional” Chinese vaccines and would alter her DNA. One message sent from a friend even falsely ventured to say that people who took the vaccine would die within two years. “I didn’t go look for these videos ... it was my friends who sent them to me,” she said when asked about her news consumption habits. Her three sons kept bugging her to get jabbed for her own safety, telling her that the videos she watched were not legitimate news sources. She also believed that the Government may restrict the movements of unvaccinated persons. So in April, she overcame her fear of the mRNA vaccine and headed to the vaccination centre to get the Pfizer jab. Mrs Chia grew worried when she got a high fever after her second dose in May. The fever subsided quickly the next day and life returned to normal. Mrs Chia still slightly worries about the long-term side effects that the videos have warned her about. But in the end, her fears about being jabbed were much ado about nothing. “It wasn’t a big deal after all,” she said.

       " {'text': 'malaysia johor covid19 hasni mohammad border reopening singapore 14930862 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners JOHOR BAHRU: Johor Chief Minister Hasni Mohammad saidthe state must focus on reducing the number of COVID-19 cases before discussions on reopening borders with Singapore. Speaking to CNA in an exclusive interview on Monday (May 31), Mr Hasni said that both sides are in agreement that talks to reopen cross-border travel have been put on hold given the COVID-19 situation in Malaysia. \"It is because of the number of cases recorded, which has kepton rising as far as Johor is concerned,\" he said, adding that further discussions will only happen when the number of cases shows a downward trend. \"The ball is in our court now. We just have to make sure that more effort is beingput towards reducing the number of cases in Johor. And I believe once the number is reduced to an acceptable level, Singapore will consider our request to reopen the borders again.\" Malaysia began itsthird nationwide lockdownon Tuesday amid a surging third wave of COVID-19 that has hit record levels in recent weeks. During the first phase of this \"total lockdown\" from Jun 1 to Jun 14,malls are shutwhile only 17 essential service sectors will be allowed to operate. These sectors include healthcare, telecommunications and media, food and beverage,utilities as well as banking. On Wednesday, Malaysia recorded 7,703 new COVID-19 cases, of which 554cases were logged in Johor. There are now more than 580,000 cases nationwide. Mr Hasni added that one way for the Johor state government to reduce the number of cases was to expedite the vaccination of local residents as soon as possible. He said that Johor has always contributed substantially to the national economy and it would be important for Malaysia that\"economic activity in Johor is able to resumeto its original level\". He is targeting for 80 per cent of the Johor population to be vaccinated by October. Moreover, under the ImmuPlan Johor initiative, the Johor state government plans to prioritise 100,000 residents for vaccination. These residents must first qualify as \"economic frontliners\" who work in Singaporeand are keen on resume commuting between Singapore and Johor. Mr Hasni said that so far, around70,000 people have qualified for the initiative and they will likely receive their vaccinations from July. He added that these economic frontliners will also be given the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, which has been approved by Singapore\\'sHealth Sciences Authority (HSA). COST OF QUARANTINE AN ISSUE FOR THOSE UNDER PCA During theinterview, Mr Hasni also touched onissues affectingMalaysian workers who are currently working in Singapore under the Periodic CommutingArrangement (PCA). Under this scheme,Malaysian workers in Singapore whohold long-term immigration passes are allowed toapply for short-term leave after working in Singapore for at least 90 consecutive days. However, some have expressed concern aboutthe costof serving quarantine when entering Singapore. Last month, Singapore announced that thosewith recent travel history to higher risk countries and regions, including Malaysia, will have to serve a21-day stay-home notice at dedicated facilitieswith effect from May 8. For those serving their 21-day stay-home notice at dedicated facilities in Singapore, the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority website shows a cost of S$3,000 for accommodation and food for a single adult. This excludes the costs of PCR tests. Additionally, these commuters are also required to serve 14 days of quarantine when entering Malaysia, where theywould be charged a maximum of RM150 per day. Mr Hasni said that he hoped the Singapore government could consider reducing the costs of quarantine for this group. \"If I may, can I express my request, and hope to the Singapore government ...It would help a lot ifthe cost of quarantine can be reconsidered to be much lower than what it is now,\" said Mr Hasni. He said these Malaysians are based in Singapore because they are holding on to a job and have obligations with their respective companies in the city state. \"So I believe that it\\'s not that they can\\'t pay, but it will help if they can have extra to spend and ... protecttheir (finances),\" he added. JOHOR KEEN ON PROCURING VACCINES FROM SINGAPORE Additionally, the chief minister said that the state government iskeen to increase Johor\\'s vaccine supply through various channels, including by procuring them fromSingapore. \"I\\'m happy toinform that we will also be discussing with a few others, including perhaps companies from Singapore, because I was made to understand, from some vaccine suppliers ...about their willingness to supply (to us). Butthey are tied to the understanding they will have to give priority to the country’s requirement first,\" said Mr Hasni. \"Once they fulfill this obligation, then only they will be allowed to discuss with other individualsor private parties,\" he added. Mr Hasni also noted how the state government has collaborated withTemasek Foundation previously to distribute face masks, hand sanitizers and ventilators to help in the state\\'s fight against COVID-19. Temasek Foundation is a Singapore-based non-profit organisation under the philanthropic arm of the state sovereign fund Temasek Holdings. He expressed hope that further collaborationcan be done to increase the supply of vaccines inJohor. \"So, maybe from the foundation\\'s perspective, it is more of charitable work. But I suppose if it is on an understanding that can be developed to manage, control or reduce the number of positive COVID-19 patients, then why not?\" said Mr Hasni. \"We will explore all possibilities as far as securing our own vaccines.\" Downloadourappor subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

       " {'text': \"covid 19 what happens when a pandemic becomes endemic 14932688 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: In a televised address on Monday (May 31), Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said he believed COVID-19 would not disappear, but instead “remain with humankind and become endemic”. The virus would continue to circulate in parts of the global population for years to come, with “small outbreaks” of the disease from time to time in Singapore, said Mr Lee. “Our aim must be to keep the community as a whole safe, while accepting that some people may get infected every now and then - just as we do with the common flu or dengue fever, which we now manage through public health measures and personal precautions, and in the case of the flu, with regular vaccinations too,” he added. Last week, Finance Minister Lawrence Wong - co-chair of the multi-ministry taskforce tackling the pandemic - said that Singapore was already planning for the possibility that COVID-19 might become endemic. But what would it mean for COVID-19 to become endemic? JUST LIKE THE COMMON COLD The term endemic refers to diseases that are constantly present within a population, with infection rates maintained at a predictable rate. Mr Lee made a comparison to dengue fever, which he noted was managed through “public health measures and personal precautions”. There is precedent for epidemics to eventually become endemic, saidProfessor Paul Tambyah, president of the Asia Pacific Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infection, who pointedto several examples. “It happened most recently with H1N1 Influenza A 2009, which became endemic within a year-and-a-half,” he said, pointing also to other instances in 1957 and 1968. COVID-19 could become “just like one of the ‘common cold’ coronaviruses”, said Prof Tambyah, with the elderly being the main concern. “That is what many people believe happened with OC43, one of today’s common cold coronaviruses which is believed to have caused the ‘Russian Flu’ pandemic of the late 19th century,” he said. Becoming endemic means COVID-19 is not going to “go away”, said Professor Dale Fisher, who chairs the World Health Organization’s Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network. “It's not going to be eradicated, it's going to be here. But for practical purposes, the only people that will go to hospital are (unvaccinated) people,” said Prof Fisher, who is also a senior infectious diseases consultant at the National University Hospital. COVID-19 could circulate and mutate in ways similar to influenza, he said, noting that in temperate climates it could become a seasonal disease. However, Prof Fisher stressedthat this does not mean that sceptics who said that COVID-19 was no worse than the flu were correct. “Anyone that's thought COVID is like the flu, I think they were proven to be wrong in many ways, not least of which is the severity (of COVID-19),” he said. While most of those who contracted the disease only experienced mild symptoms, millions have died, he pointed out. More than 3.5 million people have died from COVID-19 since the pandemic began last year, compared to the estimated 290,000 to 650,000 who die from influenza annually. The availability of vaccines has proven to be a turning point for the pandemic, turning COVID-19 into a “mild disease”, said Prof Fisher. This means some of the regulations now in place to stem the spread of COVID-19, such as border restrictions and safe management measures, couldbe eased as more people get vaccinated, he added. Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious diseases specialist with the Rophi Clinic at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital, said vaccination is an “integral strategy” in living with an endemic virus. Those who have already received both jabs of the COVID-19 vaccine should be prepared for a third shot to boost their immunity, while others could expect to have regular annual doses of the vaccine similar to flu shots, he wrote in a commentary for CNA. WHEN WILL COVID-19 BECOME ENDEMIC? Prof Fisher emphasised that it is not yet time to relax measures - such as contact tracing and testing for COVID-19 - which he stressed are necessary for Singapore to get to the “end point”. “If we take our foot off the brakes now, then we are going to have an explosive situation,” he said, noting less than 40 per cent of Singapore’s population have had at least one jab of the COVID-19 vaccine. It is hard to say when COVID-19 might become endemic globally, said Prof Tambyah, though he noted thatone estimate suggests it might take three or four years. “Endemic living will happen in Singapore when we achieve a high vaccination rate of about 70 to 90 per cent of the population and when unlinked cases do not overwhelm our contact tracing capabilities,” said Dr Leong. “Care of COVID-19 patients will improve with better medical technologies, and perhaps oral antiviral treatments and highly effective, broadly neutralising, monoclonal antibodies that can kill the virus,” he added. Still, COVID-19 becoming endemic does not rule out the possibility of future pandemics, experts say. “As long as we continue to encroach onto the territory of wild animals and do all kinds of experiments in diverse laboratories, there is always a risk of another coronavirus breakout,” said Prof Tambyah. There is a “very high chance” of a novel influenza pandemic in the next few years, he added. “There has not been very much influenza worldwide and in fact, the last case of influenza detected by surveillance in Singapore was more than a year ago,” he said, describing influenza as “promiscuous” and able to live in a variety of animals ranging from ducks to seals. “I don't think we bought a breather, nature does what it does,” said Prof Fisher. “Could there be a new strain of flu that is (similar to COVID-19) next year? That's possible.” It looks like the email address you entered is not valid. Copyright© Mediacorp 2021. Mediacorp Pte Ltd.

       " {'text': 'booster johnson johnson covid 19 vaccine delta variant 15095842 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners NEW YORK:Infectious disease experts are weighing the need for booster shots of the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna mRNA-based vaccines for Americans who received Johnson & Johnson\\'s one-dose vaccine due to the increasing prevalence of the more contagious Delta coronavirus variant. A few say they have already done so themselves, even without published data on whether combining two different vaccines is safe and effective or backing from UShealth regulators. Canada and some European countries are already allowing people to get two different COVID-19 shots. The debate centres on concerns over how protective the J&J shot is against the Delta variant first detected in India and now circulating widely in many countries. Delta, which has also been associated with more severe disease, could quickly become the dominant version of the virus in the United States, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Rochelle Walensky has warned. There is no substantial data showing how protective the J&J vaccine is against the new variant. However, UK studies show that two doses of either the Pfizer/BioNTech or AstraZeneca vaccines are significantly more protective against the variant than one. Andy Slavitt, former senior pandemic advisor to USPresident Joe Biden, raised the idea this week on his podcast. At least half a dozen prominent infectious disease experts said USregulators need to address the issue in short order. \"There\\'s no doubt that the people who receive the J&J vaccine are less protected against disease,\" than those who get two doses of the other shots, said Stanford professor DrMichael Lin. \"From the principle of taking easy steps to prevent really bad outcomes, this is really a no brainer.\" The CDC is not recommending boosters, and advisers to the agency said at a public meeting this week there is not yet significant evidence of declining protection from the vaccines. Jason Gallagher, an infectious diseases expert at Temple University’s School of Pharmacy, recently received a Pfizer dose at the Philadelphia vaccine clinic where he has been administering shots. He got the J&J vaccine in a clinical trial in November. Gallagher said he was concerned about the UK datashowing lower efficacy against the Delta variant for people who received one vaccine dose. \"While the situation has gotten so much better in the US, the Delta variant that\\'s spreading ... and really quickly taking over in the USlooks a little more concerning in terms of the breakthrough infections with the single-dose vaccines,\" he said. \"So I took the plunge.\" Cases, hospitalisations and deaths have plummeted in the United States with 56 per centof the adult population fully vaccinated. J&J said it is testing whether the immune response from its vaccine is capable of neutralising the Delta variant in a laboratory setting, but no data is available yet. Both mRNA vaccines showed efficacy rates around 95 per centin large UStrials, while J&J\\'s vaccine was 66 per centeffective in preventing moderate-to-severe COVID-19 globally when more contagious variants were circulating. DrAngela Rasmussen, a researcher at the University of Saskatchewan\\'s Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization, said on Twitter she had gotten a dose of Pfizer\\'s vaccine this week after receiving J&J\\'s in April. Rasmussen, who declined to be interviewed, encouraged Americans who received the J&J vaccine to talk to their doctors about a possible second shot. \"If you live in a community with overall low vaccination, I\\'d suggest you strongly consider doing so,\" she tweeted. Vaccine expert DrPeter Hotez from Baylor College of Medicine in a tweet said adding a second J&J dose or one of the mRNA vaccines might provide broader protection, \"but we need data and CDC-FDA guidance\". The USNational Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) is running a trial to determine the need for boosting all currently authorised shots with another dose of Moderna\\'s vaccine. NIAID scientist DrJohn Beigel told Reuters the agency hopes to have that data by September to help inform regulators\\' decisions on boosters. As long as case counts remain low in the United States, J&J recipients should wait for more data, he said. If Delta variant-driven infections and hospitalisations increase significantly, he said, \"then decisions might need to be made with an absence of data. But right now, I do think it\\'s appropriate that they wait\".

       " {'text': 'covid 19 self test kits sale antigen rapid test pharmacies 14986054 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: COVID-19 antigen rapid test (ART) kits for self-testing will be \"sold by pharmacists\" to the public from Jun 16, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) on Thursday (Jun 10). These self-test kits have received interim authorisation from the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) to be sold to the general public. The kits are: Abbott PanBioCOVID-19 Antigen Self-test, QuickVue At-Home OTC COVID-19 Test, SD Biosensor SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Self-Test Nasal, and SD Biosensor Standard Q COVID-19 Ag Home Test. These tests produce results in less than 20 minutes, said the Health Ministry. \"They are simple to use, they can be self administered. From next week, Jun 16, these kits will be dispensed by pharmacists at selected retail pharmacies. We will then open up for counter sales at more retail locations progressively,\" said Health Minister Ong Ye Kung at a multi-ministry task force press conference. Sales will initially be limited to 10 ART kits per personto ensure that there are \"adequate supplies for all”, said the Health Ministry\\'s director of medical services Kenneth Mak. But asmore supplies are made available for retail sales, authoritieswill \"eventually allow test kits to be freely purchased\", he said. Singapore is set to ease some COVID-19 measures from Jun 14 as the number of community cases falls. \"As we want to resume more activities, we need to make testing fast, easy and accessible,\" said Mr Ong. Associate Professor Mak added that the self-test kits “complement” Singapore’s overall surveillance strategy. \"These fast and easy to use testsallow us to detect infected cases more quickly, in particular among individuals who do not have acute respiratory infection symptoms, but are concerned that they may have been exposed to COVID-19,\" he said. Peoplewho have a positive result on these self-test kitsshould \"immediately approach\" a Swab and Send Home Public Health Preparedness Clinic (SASH PHPC) for a confirmatory polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, said MOH. They are then required to self-isolate until they receive a negative PCR test result, MOH added. Those who test negative on their self-test ART should continue to stay vigilant and adhere to prevailing safe management measures. “Individuals who have ARI symptoms should continue to visit a doctor for a full diagnosis and PCR test instead of relying on an ART self-test kit,” the ministrysaid. More information on how the self-test kits are to be used and how the results canbe interpretedwillbe made available through various media channels and the MOH website from Jun 16, said Assoc Prof Mak. CNA has contacted MOH for more information about the price of the self-test kits. ARTSHAVE HIGHER CHANCE OF FALSE NEGATIVE RESULTS: HSA In a separate pressrelease on Thursday, the HSA saidthat the self-test kits can be bought without a doctor\\'s prescription. ARTs detect the viral proteins in the nasal swab samples of infected people and \"usually work best in the early stages of infection\", said the authority. \"In general, ARTs can achieve a sensitivity of about 80 per centfor cases with higher viral loads and a specificity range of 97 to 100 per cent,\" said the HSA. Sensitivity refers to the test’s ability to correctly detect COVID-19in individuals with the disease, while specificity refers to the test’s ability to correctly identify individuals without COVID-19, explained the authority. ARTs have lower sensitivity than PCR tests, which means the rapid tests have a \"higher chance of false negative results\". Incorrect sample preparation ortesting process when using the test,or a low viral protein levelin the user’s nasal sample – for example, one to two days after potential exposure to the virus – could also result in a false negative result,HSA added. All kitswill come with leaflets providinginstructions for use, and HSA urged consumers to read these carefully before using the tests. \"Users should collect their nasal sample using the swab provided in the kit and prepare their nasal sample using thebuffer and tube provided. \"Once the sample is ready, users should perform the test using the test device and read the results,\" said the authority, adding that people should follow the instructions in the leaflet closely in order to get valid results. HSAalso noted that as part of its interim authorisation, these test developers are required to collect the relevant accuracy and safety data and monitor the use of their tests. Additional data from ongoing clinical studies must also be submitted post-approval for HSAto ensure the continued safety and efficacy of these tests, HSA said.

The Ministry of Health had said the previous week that it had lifted therestrictions on the use of COVID-19 messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccineson some people with a history of anaphylaxis, allowing them to now receive the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna jab. \"More people can now be covered with the lifting of restrictions on persons with a history of anaphylaxis due to food and other medicines,\" said Health Minister Ong Ye Kung in a Facebook post on Tuesday night. He also said that the Government would begin sending SMSes to more than 30,000 people in this group on Tuesday, inviting them to register for their jabs. The decision to remove restrictions was takenafter a recommendation from Singapore\\'sExpert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination. \"Local and international data indicates that mRNA vaccines are suitable for use in persons with anaphylaxis not related to mRNA vaccinations or its components,\"the committee had said. It recommended that people with a history of anaphylaxis or allergic reactions to other drugs, food, insect stingsor unknown triggers can be vaccinated with a 30-minute observation period after the jab. People with a history of anaphylaxis due to any component of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine are still not recommended to receive the jab. Previously the committee had recommended that those with ahistory of anaphylaxis not receive themRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines\"out of an abundance of caution\". Mr Ong also provided an update on Singapore\\'s vaccination rate, saying that75 per cent ofadults in Singapore who are eligible for the vaccine hadsigned up for or received their vaccine doses. \"We are able to manage this wave of infections successfully, due to all our collective efforts. Many thanks to everyone!\" said the health minister, who added that \"our people continue to support vaccination\" even as issues such as vaccine disinformation and racial discrimination were taking the limelight on social media. \"In the process, various issues came to the fore on social media – that COVID-19 vaccines are harmful to us, that mRNA vaccines do not work. And there were very ugly incidents involving racial discrimination and xenophobia as well.\" People in Singapore have continued to support vaccination \"despite all these distractions\", said Mr Ong. \"I admire the courage of those who spoke up for greater understanding, unity, kindness during such times, and defending evidence-based science,\" he added.

It comes a day after more cases were confirmed in the Tiong Bahru neighbourhood, including one that was unlinked. Employees and tenants at eight affected locations will be swabbed over two days at designated sites in Bukit Merah, including a temporary site at 2D Boon Tiong Road and 84ARedhill Lane. Mandatory testing is also being extended to all stallholders and employees at Tiong Bahru Market and Food Centre, after a COVID-19 patient visited 18 Jalan Membina. Minister in the Prime Minister’s OfficeIndranee Rajah, who is also a Member of Parliament forTanjong Pagar GRC, said it was a precautionary measure and that no case had been picked up at Tiong Bahru market. “Block 18 Jalan Membina is not too far from the market so, in case anybody went over there doing a preemptive testing,” she said. “If a case is picked up then obviously, they have to make sure that (they do) all the same procedures (such as) contact tracing, who the person was in contact with.” “We saw this play out with the Bukit Merah View side, initially it was one person and the market could continue, but once you start to pick up more than a few cases, obviously, the market had to be shut down to break that transmission.” She added that Tiong Bahru market was “certainly not at that stage”, at the moment. When CNA visited Jalan Membina at 11am on Friday, most stores appeared to be operating, with the exception of one childcare centre that had been closed for the day as a precaution. The nearbyTiong Bahru Yong Tao Hu Coffeeshop at 56 Eng Hoon Street, which is one of the affected locations, was shuttered. A stall assistant from the coffeeshop was among the 17 new COVID-19 cases linked to theBukit Merah View cluster on Thursday. MOH said on Thursday that it had conducted mandatory testing on Wednesday for all owners, staff and tenants working at 79 and 85 Redhill Lane, where the Redhill Market and Redhill Food Centre are located. This was \"out of an abundance of caution\" after two COVID-19 cases were detected there. All 397 owners, tenants and staff of shops and commercial unitstested negative for COVID-19, the ministry said. Free COVID-19 tests will also be offered to members of the public who visited the affected locations in the first half of June.

MOH hadannounced on Monday that through the special access route, private healthcare institutions will be ableto bring in unregistered COVID-19 vaccines. These vaccines must be on WHO\\'s emergency use listing and they include the ones from Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca and Sinopharm. The Sinovac vaccine was approved by the WHO on Tuesday. Although Singapore has received supplies of the Sinovac doses, the vaccinehas not been approved for use by theHealth Sciences Authority (HSA). It has only given the green light to thePfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, which are both based on mRNA technology. The mRNA vaccines, however, are not suitable for people with a history of severe allergic reactions such as anaphylaxis and for immunocompromised individuals. On Wednesday, MOH said itwill release more details in the coming few daysfor private healthcare institutions to apply to be licensed providers for the Sinovac-CoronaVac COVID-19 vaccine under the special access route. \"We are also studying the possibility for the private healthcare institutions to access our current stock of 200,000 doses, and work out details on pricing, informed consent process and safety of the patients who prefer to be administered with Sinovac-CoronaVac under the SAR,\" said MOH in response to media queries. The ministry also reiterated that Sinovac is not part of the nationalvaccine programme and therefore will not be covered under the Vaccine Injury Financial Assistance Programme for COVID-19 Vaccination. As more international and local data becomes available, the expert committee on COVID-19 vaccination is also reviewing current restrictions to allow people with a known history of anaphylaxis to be vaccinatedwith the two mRNA vaccines currently approved for use here, the ministry said. Sinovac employs a different technology, usingan inactivated form of coronavirus to trigger an immune response to the virus. WHO recommendedthe vaccine for use in adults 18 years and older, in a two-dose schedule spread out across two to four weeks. \"Vaccine efficacy results showed that the vaccine prevented symptomatic disease in 51 per cent of those vaccinated and prevented severe COVID-19 and hospitalisation in 100 per cent of the studied population,\"the global agency said in a statement.

       " {'text': \"covid 19 mutant strain b1617 vaccination pfizer moderna 14919624 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners We should be prepared to live in a world where the majority are vaccinated and testing is quicker, says infectious disease expert Dr Leong Hoe Nam. SINGAPORE: We first heard rumblings of a novel virus in Wuhan in October 2019. People were hospitalised with pneumonia a few months later. The first case of the severe acute respiratory syndrome now known as SARS-CoV-2 was finally announced by the World Health Organization (WHO) on Dec 31, 2019 and was only identified as COVID-19 weeks later. Since then, the virus has been doing what all viruses are programmed to do: Survive by adapting to their human hosts, almost flawlessly. In less than 12 months, it arguably created the ultimate mutant, the B1617 strain first detected in India and has since been reported in 53 territories according to WHO. This in a way signals to us an important turning point in our story: The endemic strain is here.On Friday (May 28), co-chair of the COVID-19 multi-ministry task force, Lawrence Wong alluded to this possibility too saying that the Government is planning for a scenario where we live with the virus. Endemics have a constant presence in a specific location and can lead to outbreaks that happen anywhere. Four other coronaviruses already co-exist as common colds and we have come to live with them. The question before us now is how did the B1617 strain become so successful at spreading across continents and can we live harmoniously with it? ADAPTING BY MUTATING The primary weapon of a virus is its genes. It uses single-stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA) for coding. RNA gives the virus up to a thousand times more opportunities to mutate than human genes which are coded with DNA. And being single-stranded, there is no complementary strand to keep accidental mutations in check. It looks like the email address you entered is not valid. Once the virus enters the human body, there are plenty of opportunities for it to mutate. Scientists estimate there could be between 1 billion and 100 billion copies of the virus in just one human body. That is a staggering figure - at more than 10 times the number of people living on the planet.Most mutations are harmful to the virus itself. Many are neutral and provide no benefits to the virus, but some help its transmission and support its ability to survive. The latest B1617 mutant benefits the virus in three distinct ways. The virus is more easily transmitted with higher viral loads which results in a greater total number of viral particles per cough. Second, it is more infectious and can bind its targeted ACE2 protein receptor more easily.Third, it is better at evading the immune system although it is still unclear how much of a milder strain it has mutated into. So, the B1617 is in the lead. It is replacing existing strains. Countries exposed to this mutant have reported increasing prevalence of this new strain, from Singapore to Nepal, Australia and the United Kingdom. But precisely because the world answers the virus challenge with a disorganised mix of lockdowns, masks and social distancing, the mutation is able to break through these. Even if the B1617 strain does not spread further, other strains – even though they are unrelated – could mutate in the same way, under evolutionary pressures. This is called convergent evolution, where viruses from different strains adapt the same beneficial mutations without these strains ever meeting. VACCINES – THE GOOD, THE BAD, THE UGLY Just as most of the world’s vaccine manufacturers focused on developing immunity against the spike protein - the part of the virus which attaches to receptors on human cells and gains entry inside - the virus adapted by mutating the same protein, evading the immune response triggered by the vaccines. The good news is that the mRNA vaccines produced by Pfizer and Moderna are highly effective against the original COVID-19. The bad news is that their 94 to 95 per cent efficacy falls to 70 to 75 per cent against the B1617 strain. But the illness has been milder in those who have fallen sick from this “ultimate mutant”, transforming a deadly infection into a common cold. This was seen in the mild or asymptomatic people who fell sick in the Tan Tock Seng Hospital cluster despite having been vaccinated. Only one elderly patient required the very transient use of oxygen. So one could say that the SARS-CoV-2 only had bark without bite because of vaccination. Which is why vaccinations must go on. The hope of every vaccine is to achieve “sterilising immunity” - when a vaccine prevents infection effectively because the immune system stops the virus from entering cells and replicating. But no vaccine has ever achieved that. Breakthrough failures occur, constantly, in varying proportions but the impact of these failures diminishes with rising herd immunity. The classic example is the measles vaccine, where herd immunity of greater than 90 per cent minimised breakthrough failures. Pockets of infection occur when the highly transmissible measles virus infects a community with low herd immunity, resulting in significant deaths. Amidst the global vaccine shortage, we should therefore try and use the best available vaccine and achieve a high vaccine coverage of at least 70 to 90 per cent, especially in the face of mutants which render the vaccines less effective. In a census continually updated, the US Center for Disease Control (CDC) reported only 1,949 hospitalisedor fatal, vaccine breakthrough cases among 123 million fully vaccinated people. This equates to 0.002 per cent risk of hospitalisation or death. Even overestimated at 10 times higher risk of breakthrough infections with mutants, the burden on the hospitals and healthcare system would still be dramatically reduced. Among vaccinated individuals, transmission to others has been significantly reduced. A research paper by British doctors and yet to be published has estimated the chances of vaccinated people transmitting the virus to members of their household were reduced by more than half, or 54 per cent, while the likelihood of it being transmitted to healthcare workers was cut by 92 per cent, 14 days after the second dose. It is worth noting that this study was done between December 2020 and March2021 involving 144,000 healthcare workers and their families – before the B1617 variant changed things significantly. Butthe data shows that vaccinations do convert a deadly disease to a mild illness, reducing the need for hospitalisation, cutting the burden on healthcare systemsand slowing the spread of infection across highly vaccinated communities. Crucially, it shows vaccines are an integral strategy in living with an endemic virus. With the threat of failing immunity over time, and the virus adapting further, all vaccinated people must be prepared for a third booster shot to top up their immunity. This may be a painful proposition but if we want to live with the virus, it’s a necessary step. Science is rushing to answer the question if the third dose is best with the same or different technology. The possibility of a third dose guided by our understanding of the level of protection provided by antibodies may be a reality in future. In some individuals, there may be even a requirement for repeated annual doses, much like how we get flu shots annually. (Are COVID-19 vaccines still effective against new variants? And could these increase the risk of reinfection? Listen to the full conversation with Profs David Matchar and Gavin Smith on on CNA's Heart of the Matter podcast.) WHAT ENDEMIC LIVING LOOKS LIKE The future of endemic living with COVID-19 is tenable but it means we will need to accept and learn to live with the virus. Apart from vaccinations, masks must persist too. Data clearly shows they reduce transmission but people must give up frivolous cosmetic masks and replace them with certified masksknown to be effective. Testing is another big plank in living with an endemic virus. Healthcare providers at family clinics must offer rapid antigen testing recommended and endorsed by the WHO. This is a cheaper, more easily administered alternative, with a much shorter 15-minute turnaround time. The strength of these tests is their excellent sensitivity and their ability to identify COVID-19 positive individuals in the first five days of illness when infectiousness is highest. According to the American CDC, antigen tests - when done correctly - approximate the gold standard PCR tests, in sensitivity and specificity, in the first five days of illness - especially when done in symptomatic persons. Similar home-care kits are available in countries such as the US and the United Kingdom. These tests have limitations as a confirmatory test, a role better served by polymerase chain reaction, or PCR tests, which detect fragments of virus even after you are no longer infected. We should expect that, in future, rapid antigen testing will be done at each individual’s home - either with a swab or a nasal rinse, or a saliva test kit, prior to leaving home, which is the holy grail. This can be done when a person is showing symptoms, or a few times a week, at least. These could also render those highly visible thermometer readers less necessary, if people carry their results with them before they head out. Care of COVID-19 patients will improve with better medical technologies, and perhaps oral anti-viral treatments and highly effective, broadly neutralising, monoclonal antibodies that can kill the virus. Endemic living will happen in Singapore when we achieve a high vaccination rate of about 70 to 90 per cent of the population and when unlinked cases do not overwhelm our contact tracing capabilities. Singapore may win the current fight, but the next battle will be even tougher. Preparing for endemic living with COVID-19 should start now. The earlier we prepare ourselves, the more resilient we become.After all, the coronavirus has succeeded on four other prior occasions. There is no reason for it to fail now.

       " {'text': 'covid 19 how to use diy art test at home nose swab 15002936 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: COVID-19 antigen rapid test (ART) kits for self-testing will be dispensed in pharmacies to the public from Wednesday (Jun 16), the Ministry of Health (MOH) announced on Jun 10. ARTs detect the viral proteins in the nasal swab samples of infected individuals and usually work best in the early stages of infection. Four self-test kits have received interim authorisation from the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) to be sold to the general public:The Abbott PanBio COVID-19 Antigen Self-test, QuickVue At-Home OTC COVID-19 Test, SD Biosensor SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Self-Test Nasal, and SD Biosensor Standard Q COVID-19 Ag Home Test. According to the Health Ministry, these tests produce results in less than 20 minutes. If you’re planning to pick some up when they go on sale, here’s what you need to know about these self-test kits. Q: Where can I get the ART self-test kits? A: The kits will be available at selected Unity, Watsons and Guardian outlets islandwide. From Jun 16, these kits will be dispensed by pharmacists at selected retail pharmacies, said Health Minister Ong Ye Kung on Jun 10. “We will then open up for counter sales at more retail locations progressively,\" he added. The test kits will be dispensed by the pharmacist in-store, which means customers have to consult a pharmacist before purchasing them. They can be bought without a doctor’s prescription, said HSAin an update on Jun 10. According to Quantum Technologies Global, the distributor of the QuickVue tests, training will be provided to pharmacists on how to teachcustomers on the correct usage of the tests. All 79 Guardian stores with an in-store pharmacy will carry the COVID-19 ART kits including the Guardian store at the Giant outlet in Suntec City, said a Dairy Farm Group spokesperson in response to CNA\\'s queries. Customers canvisit Guardian’s website to use the \"Pharmacy\"filter to locate these stores. The Abbott PanBioTM COVID-19 Antigen Self-test and the QuickVue At-Home OTC COVID-19 Test will be available at Guardian outlets, the spokesperson added. 39 Unity pharmacies will offer the test kits from Jun 16, said a FairPrice spokesperson in response to CNA\\'s queries. These stores were “specially selected” as they have in-store pharmacists who are “professionally trained” to assess whether customers are suitable to use the ART kits and provide information on how to use them, said the spokesperson. The Abbot Panbio COVID-19 Antigen Self-Test and Quidel QuickVue At-Home OTC COVID-19 Test kits will be available at all Watsons pharmacy stores in the first phase of the test kit roll out, said a spokesperson for the company. Theself-test kits will be gradually expanded to more Watsons stores and Watsons Online in the second phase, the spokesperson said in response to CNA queries. Consumers will be able to locate Watsons pharmacy stores using the store finder option on the company’s website or via the store locator on the Watsons SG mobile app. Q: How much will the test kits cost and how many can I buy? Sales will initially be limited to 10 ART kits per person to ensure that there are \"adequate supplies for all”, said the Health Ministry\\'s director of medical services Kenneth Mak on Jun 10. But as more supplies are made available for retail sales, authorities will \"eventually allow test kits to be freely purchased\", he said. According to Watsons, the pharmacy will be keeping with MOH’s recommended guidelines for the selling price of the kits. This ranges from S$10 to S$13 per test kit depending on the size of the pack purchased, said the spokesperson. “We would advise the public to keep to the guidelines of maximum 10 test kits per customer so as to ensure there would be sufficient test kits for everyone. We would be monitoring the demands closely and stock up to meet with the consumer needs,” the spokesperson added. The FairPrice spokesperson said that details on the type of kits and pricing are still being finalised, and more informationwill be available soon. Dairy Farm\\'s spokesperson also said the company will adhere to MOH\\'s pricing guidelines. CNA has contacted the ministryfor more information about the price of the self-test kits. From Jun 16, Quantum Technologies Global will have about 500,000 tests available, and more kits will be flown in from the United States in the coming weeks, said a company spokesperson in response to CNA queries. Abbott is “well-positioned” to fulfill the demand for COVID-19 tests, said Abbott’s APAC divisional vice-president for rapid diagnostics Sanjeev Johar. “We expect to make millions of Panbio Antigen Rapid Tests available for Singapore over the coming months, as needed,” he added. Q: How do these test kits work? What should I look out for? Those using the self-test kits should collect their nasal sample using the swabs provided in the kits, said HSA in the press release on Jun 10. They should then prepare their nasal sample with the buffer and tube provided. Once the sample is ready, users should use it with the test device and read the results, said HSA. While performing the test, users should follow the instructions in the instructionleafletsto get valid results, the authorities said. The instructions for all four self-test kits may differ slightly. For example, the QuickVue test uses a test strip dipped in the buffer solution, while the one manufactured by Abbott involves dripping the buffer solution on a rapid test device. \"For children younger than 14 years, an adult caretaker should help collect the nasal samples and conduct the test procedures,\" said Abbott. Q: Are these test kits effective and accurate? What should I do if I test positive? In general, ARTs can achieve a sensitivity of about 80 per cent for cases with higher viral loads and a specificity range of 97 to 100 per cent, saidHSA. Sensitivity refers to the test’s ability to correctly detect COVID-19 in individuals with the , while specificity refers to the test’s ability to correctly identify individuals without COVID-19. ARTs have lower sensitivity than the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, which means suchtests have a \"higher chance of false negative results\", said HSA in the press release. Incorrect sample preparation or testing process when using the test, or a low viral protein level in the user’s nasal sample – for example, one to two days after potential exposure to the virus – could also result in a false negative result, HSA added. Infectious diseases expert Dr Leong Hoe Nam urged users to follow the instructions on how to use the test kits strictly and “to the letter”. A properly done test will “carry a similar sensitivity” to a PCR test, especially if it’s repeated every three to five days, he added. “A negative test doesn’t mean you don’t have it but you’re less likely to have COVID-19,” said Dr Leong. Q: What should I do if I see a positive result? People who have a positive result on these self-test kits should \"immediately approach\" a Swab and Send Home Public Health Preparedness Clinic (SASH PHPC) for a confirmatory PCRtest, said MOH. After that, they must self-isolate until they receive a negative PCR test result, MOH added. Those who test negative on their self-test ART kit should continue to stay vigilant and adhere to prevailing safe management measures, said the Health Ministry. “Individuals who have ARI symptoms should continue to visit a doctor for a full diagnosis and PCR test instead of relying on an ART self-test kit.” Downloadourappor subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

       " {'text': 'covid 19 vaccine students how to register where to get faq 14920852 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: Singapore is expanding its national COVID-19 vaccination programme to include students, with registrations for more than 400,000 schoolchildren aged 12 and above to open on Tuesday (Jun 1). The announcement, made by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong in a televised speech on Monday, comes after the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was approved by the Health Sciences Authority for those aged 12 to 15 earlier this month. The exercise will begin with graduating cohorts from secondary schools and at the pre-university levels, said the Ministry of Education (MOE) in a separate press release. Slots will be available from Jun 3. Here are some frequently asked questions about the vaccination exercise for students and how they can get their jab. Q: How do I register for the vaccine for myself or my child? A: Eligible students aged 18 and above as well as parents of children below 18 will progressively receive SMSes with a unique registration link, said the Education Ministry. Graduating cohorts from secondary schools and at the pre-university levels - in particular, students sitting for the GCE N-, O- or A-Level examinations later this year - will be the first to receive the vaccination invitation. Over the next two weeks, the remaining full-time students in schools and institutes of higher learning will receive their invitations to register for the vaccine, said the Education Ministry. This includes privately-funded schools, madrasahs and special education schools, said MOE in the press release. Privately-funded schools comprise Anglo-Chinese School (International), StJoseph\\'s Institution International High School and Hwa Chong International School. Parents of students in graduating cohorts who do not receive the SMS by Jun 3 should contact their children’s school for assistance. “Schools will also be reaching out to parents of students in mainstream primary and secondary schools separately with additional details on their vaccinations. In general, students who are in schools and the Institutes of Higher Learning should receive their SMSes by the end of the second week of June,” said MOE in a factsheet. SMS invites will only be sent to parents or guardians of children who are 12 years old as of Jun 1. Students whose 12th birthday fall after Jun 1 will be invited for their vaccination at a later date, said MOE. Q: Can I choose which vaccine I want to take? A: Students below 18 will only be offered the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, while those aged 18 and above can opt for either vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna, said the Education Ministry. For both vaccines, the interval between the first and second dose will be six to eight weeks. Q: Where can I get vaccinated? A: Eligible students can get their jabs at community vaccination centres. There will also be four dedicated MOE vaccination centres set up at Raffles City Convention Centre, ITE College Central, ITE College East and ITE College West, said MOE. ITE will arrange for their students to take their vaccinations on campus. Each ITE centre will have up to 1,600 vaccination slots per day, \"comparable\" to community vaccination centres, while Raffles Convention Centre can take up to 2,000 slots per day, said MOE in a briefing on Monday. The ministry will also deploy mobile vaccination teams to special education schools to “facilitate access” for eligible students who may find it challenging to visit a vaccination centre. Q: Will parents be allowed to accompany their child to the vaccination centre? A: Parents are required to accompany their child to the vaccination centre if they are below 13 years old. Parents of students aged 13 and above are not required to be present. Should they choose to do so, however, they will be asked to wait at a family area outside the vaccination room to avoid congestion and ensure compliance with safe management measures. Students in special education schools must also be accompanied by a parent or guardian. Parental or guardian consent is also required for students below 18, as part of the booking process for the vaccination slots through the National Appointment System, said MOE. Consent given via the system will be collected once, and will apply for both doses of the vaccine. Q: What happens if I miss my vaccination appointment? Will I be allowed to make another appointment? A: Students who miss their first vaccination appointment during the MOE vaccination exercise will be able to reschedule when the vaccination is open to the public for their age bands, said the ministry in the factsheet. If students miss their second vaccination appointment, they should contact MOH at 1800 333 9999 for further assistance. Q: What if my vaccination appointment clashes with my upcoming oral national examinations? A: If students’ upcoming oral national examination schedules clash with their appointment dates for the first or second dose of their vaccination, changes to their oral examination dates within the examination window can be accommodated where possible, said the Education Ministry. New appointment dates for the vaccination can also be scheduled. Special consideration may be applicable if rescheduling is not possible, and parents or students should provide evidence of the vaccination appointment to facilitate this, said MOE.

The cases were from three different households, said MOH, with the latest being a 13-year-old student whose infection was confirmed on Jun 5. The student fromPaya Lebar Methodist Girls’ School is currently an unlinked case. She was tested for COVID-19 after developing anosmia or the loss of smell. Four cases at the Sumang Walk block tested positive earlier in May and were linked to theChangi Airport Terminal 3 cluster. All are family members, identified asCases63347,63459,63473 and 63474. Case63347 is a 45-year-old Indonesian woman employed by Clean Hub Facility as a cleaner at EuHabitat. Her infection was confirmed on May 16. Case 63459 is a 63-year-old Singaporean man employed by Certis Cisco as an aviation security officer at Changi Airport Terminal 3. The other two cases in this household are students, aged eight and 14, atMadrasah Al-Ma\\'arif Al-Islamiah. The remaining three cases in the block were earlier linked to the cluster involving Case 63516 -a 28-year-old Singaporean homemaker whose infection was confirmed on May 20. Her family members are Case63513, a 29-year-old Singaporean man who works at Slide and Hide System, and a one-year-old boy listed as Case 63572. VISITORS ENCOURAGED TO COME FORWARD The mandatory polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing is carried out to prevent any possible spread in the community,said MOH. \"In the event that a positive COVID-19 case is detected, MOH will isolate the case, identify all close contacts, test and quarantine them to protect the community from further transmission,\" it added. \"Epidemiological investigations are ongoing to determine linkages and the source of transmission.\" People who had visited the block from May 10 to Jun 5 are also encouraged to come forward for testing, said the ministry. Testing will be conducted at the pavilion at Block 324 Sumang Walk on Tuesday and Wednesday from 9am to 4pm. Leaflets have been distributed and SMS notifications have been sent to residents, said MOH. Residents are also advised to monitor their health closely and consult a doctor immediately if they feel unwell, it added. \"Those who are still awaiting their PCR test results are advised to minimise social interactions as much as possible. They should continue to monitor their health and seek immediate medical attention if they feel unwell.\" In a Facebook post, Member of Parliament for Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC Janil Puthucheary said residents who live in the surrounding blocks do not need to get tested unless they have visited Block325A between May 10 and Jun 5. \"Our town council together with NEA have conducted a thorough cleaning and disinfection of the common areas at Blk 325A and the surrounding blocks. Very grateful for their prompt efforts,\" he added. Those with queries can call 1800 333 9999 for more information. UPDATE ON HOUGANG AVENUE 8 TESTING The ministry also provided an update on the testing exercise conducted for several blocks inHougang Avenue 8 last week. A total of 1,413 residents of Block 506 Hougang Avenue 8 and people working in shops atseven neighbouring blocks have been tested. \"Mandatory testing for this group has concluded with no COVID-19 cases reported,\" said MOH. As for visitors toBlock 506 Hougang Avenue 8, as well asresidents and visitors ofthe seven neighbouring blocks, 3,778 of them havevoluntarily stepped forward for testing. Of these, 3,531 people were found to be negative for COVID-19 infection and 247 test results are pending. The testing exercise last week was the second round of mandatory COVID-19 testing for residents and visitors ofBlock 506 Hougang Avenue 8. It was conducted after a new cluster was linked to Block 506, and viral fragments were detected in wastewater samples from some of the blocks in the area. The seven neighbouring blocks are511 Hougang Avenue 10; 681, 683 and 684 Hougang Avenue 8; 682 Hougang Avenue 4; and 685 and 698 Hougang Street 61.

       " {'text': 'covid 19 recovery grant temporary workers self employed 14918718 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: A COVID-19 grant to help workers and self-employed people who are experiencing income loss through the Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) period will open for application on Thursday (Jun 3). Eligible individuals placed on involuntary no-pay leave for at least a month between May 16 and Jun 30 may receive a one-off payout of up to S$700, while those who experience significant income loss of at least 50 per cent may receive up to S$500. The Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) on Monday released details on the eligibility criteria for applicants and the application process for the COVID-19 Recovery Grant - Temporary. MSF said the grant is a \"temporary scheme to facilitate quicker assistance to those whose incomes have fallen significantly and suddenly as a result of this round of closures and tighter restrictions\". This complements the existing COVID-19 Recovery Grant, which supports individuals who have involuntarily lost their jobs, placed on involuntary no-pay leave or face significant income loss for at least three consecutive months due to the COVID-19 pandemic, added the ministry. Here\\'s what you need to know about the COVID-19 Recovery Grant - Temporary. WHO IS IT FOR? Singaporeans or permanent residents aged 21 and above can apply for the grant. Applicants must live in a property with annual value of not more than S$21,000 and not own more than one property. Prior to the income loss or involuntary no-pay leave, their household income must not exceed S$7,800, or S$2,600 per capita. Employees should have worked for at least a total of six months between January 2019 and December 2020. Self-employed people can apply if their net trade income is reduced by at least 50 per cent for at least a month between May 16 and Jun 30 compared to their average monthly net trade income in 2019 or 2020. Individuals who involuntarily lost their jobs should instead apply for the COVID-19 Recovery Grant, which provides three months of financial support. CAN THOSE ON OTHER SUPPORT SCHEMES APPLY? MSF said the COVID-19 Recovery Grant - Temporary is \"meant for those who are not receiving support in June 2021\". As such, individuals cannot receive both the COVID-19 Recovery Grant and the temporary grant concurrently, \"so there is no duplication of support\", said the ministry. Likewise, those who are getting help from other COVID-19 support schemes like the COVID-19 Driver Relief Fund are not eligible. Applicants are also not eligible if they are receiving assistance from ComCare, SGUnited or the Seafarers Relief Package. Full-time National Servicemen are not eligible. Those who have previously received the COVID-19 Recovery Grant can apply for the temporary grant if they are not receiving support in June 2021. Individuals can receive up to two tranches of support from the COVID-19 Recovery Grant and one tranche from the temporary grant. HOW TO APPLY? The online application portal will open from 9am on Jun 3 to 11.59pm on Jul 2. Applicants should prepare the following supporting documents: - Documents on bank account details for the disbursement of funds - For employees: Relevant documents indicating placement on involuntary no-pay leave or salary loss of at least 50 per cent for at least a month - For self-employed people: Relevant documents indicating that you are currently self-employed No proof of job search or training will be required for applicants. This is because the intent of the temporary grant is \"to provide one-off financial support to affected individuals during a period of tightened restrictions, where it may be challenging for applicants to find a job or seek out training opportunities\", said MSF. Those who need help completing the online application form can ring theComCare Call hotline or email MSF\\'s Social Service Office. Alternatively, they can visit their nearest Social Service Office.

Among these builders, 26 had allowed workers or visitors to enter their worksites without performing SafeEntry check-ins at the site entrances. \"These included two sites which had let in workers who were subsequently found to be COVID-positive,\" saidBCA in a media release. BCA said it has heightened its enforcement stance and stepped up checks at construction sites, going from 300 inspections a week fromlast June to more than 900 a week currently. This is done “to ensure that builders are doing their part to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission among the construction workforce\", the authority said. BCA issued three-day stop-work orders to the builders who failed to ensure that workers or visitors checked in before entering their worksites. Under thesestop-work orders, all activities at a worksite have to be halteduntil buildersreview their safe management measures plan, rectify non-compliances and submit a compliance report to BCA. “Sites that are found with COVID-positive cases will need to do a thorough disinfection before works can resume,” BCA said. In addition to the lax deployment of TraceTogether-only SafeEntry orthe failure to enforce SafeEntry check-ins at worksite entrances, several other non-compliances were found by BCA. These includehaving workers without BCA’s approval performing works on site,workers not adhering to safe distancing or not wearing masks, and worksites lacking proper zonal segregation. BCA also said that it has steppedup its enforcement stance on builders who fail to appoint safe management officers or safe distancing officers to escort and supervise workers or visitors who work or provide services at multipleworksites. “The safe management officers or safe distancing officers would need to ensure that these workers or visitors do not intermingle with the workforce and that all safe management measures are strictly adhered to throughout their stay on site,” BCA said. “Sites that are found to have (flouted) this requirement will be issued three-day stop-work orders.” Under BCA’s heightened enforcement stance, errant builders may also be fined and charged in court. “BCA takes a serious view of any failure to comply with safe management measures in worksites,” it said. “As any non-compliance can easily undermine the efforts and good work of the rest of the industry in combating the transmission of COVID-19, BCA has heightened our enforcement stance against builders which are found to be non-compliant with COVID-19 laws. “Builders with worksites that are found to be non-compliant will be issued longer stop-work orders, composition fines up to S$2,000 or face prosecution.” Editor’s note:An earlier version of this story said that two worksites allowed workers who tested positive for COVID-19 to enter. BCA has updated its media release to clarify that the workers who were let in were subsequently found to be COVID-positive.

This is more than half of the number of students who have been invited to register for vaccinationsso far, Education Minister Chan Chun Sing said on Tuesday (Jun 1) onChannel 5’s News Tonight. Mr Chan announced on Monday that more than 400,000 students aged 12 and above will be invited to register for vaccinationsfrom Tuesday,with the earliest slots available from Jun 3. The exercise started with graduating cohorts from secondary schools and at the pre-university levels, in particular, students sitting for the GCE N-, O- or A-Level examinations later this year, said the Ministry of Education (MOE) in a separate press release on Monday. Mr Chan said on Tuesday there was no \"specific target\" as to the number of students to be vaccinated during the June school holidays. “Our goal was really to offer to all the students that are eligiblemedicallyto do so, and we hope that they will sign up as soon as possible, because that will allow us to create a safer environment for everyone before they return back to school,” said Mr Chan. “So we would want to achieve as high a number as possible.” Mr Chan added that parents are \"very mature\" and have \"read the materials\" regarding the safety of COVID-19 vaccines for children. \"Before we approve the use of the vaccine, we have gotten the available scientific evidence to assure ourselves that this is something that is safe for our children before we allow it to be used in the country,\" said the minister, adding that other countries such as the US and Israel have also rolled out vaccination programmes for children as well. A MUTATING VIRUS Mr Chan said that schools will use \"a whole suite of things\" to deal with COVID-19. “In this fight with the COVID-19 virus, we must always remember that it is a multi-dimensional challenge and we cannot just depend on one particular tool in our arsenal,” he added. \"Even with vaccination, we must continue to maintain the safe management measures, we must also continue to uphold our personal hygiene and thecleanliness of our environment.\" Mr Chan said there are four dedicated centres for the vaccination of students - three are in ITEs and one more in the Raffles Convention Centre. The Education Minister added that the virus is \"mutating\". “It will keep challenging us in the way we manage the virus, and how we control it, how we provide a safe environment for ourselves. And we must never be complacent and fall into the trap thinking that one set of methods will always be able to cater to a mutating virus,\" said Mr Chan. “As the virus mutates, we must also update our ways which we control the disease and how to protect ourselves.\" Downloadourappor subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

This comes asthe first of four dedicated Ministry of Education (MOE) vaccination centres,ITE College Central,began operations. The other three centres – located at Raffles City Convention Centre, ITE College East and ITE College West - will be progressively opened in the coming days, said Mr Chan. Each ITE centre can take up to 1,600 vaccination slots a day, \"comparable\" to community vaccination centres, while Raffles Convention Centre can handle up to 2,000 slots a day. In a Facebook post, Mr Chan said that four out of five students in polytechnics and the first year of junior college have signed up, as have five out of seven students in Primary 6 to Secondary 3. Invitations to receive the COVID-19 vaccine were progressively rolled out to students, starting with graduating cohorts from secondary schools and at pre-university levels, in particular students sitting for the GCE N-, O- and A-Level examinations. Mr Chan said he was “grateful for everyone’s understanding and care to prioritise our graduating and younger cohorts in this national effort”, adding that the invitations will be extended to students in autonomous universities starting onTuesday. “We will continue reaching out to our students and families who need more help to register and get their vaccinations done,” he said. MOE announced on May 31 that more than 400,000 students will be eligible after the Health Sciences Authority approved the use of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for those aged 12 to 15.

       " {'text': 'covid entertainment nightlife karaoke club bar singapore 14904416 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: Their businesses may have been hit hard, their dance floors converted to pop-up restaurants and their karaoke rooms turned into work spaces, but operators of nightlife and entertainment businesses say that there remains hope for the industry amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Speaking to CNA, chief executive officer of Zouk Group Andrew Li noted that the demand for the industry remains. “We\\'re a species that needs that social kind of element ... For example, when you saw dining coming out, dining was flying because people just wanted to go out and eat. They wanted to have fun with their friends,” he said. “And I think bars and nightlife are another level of that, where it is even more sociable and I think that\\'s very, very important to us as a society.” HaveFun Karaoke founder Mr Flint Lu echoed such sentiments, pointing out that socialising is an “essential need”. “We are still confident about (the) post-COVID market. So we have no other way but to stick to the plan of how to survive this pandemic,” explained Mr Lu. Ms Jean Teo, who is a director atTeo Heng karaoke, said that karaoke singing is part of the “lifestyle” in Singapore. “We find that there are a lot of people who really love singing,” she told CNA. “It has become a way for us to express ourselves. And it\\'s also very good for our mental health, it helps us to really relieve our emotions and de-stress and all that. I get a lot of feedback from people, that once we are open, they will definitely come and support (us).” Singapore Nightlife Business Association (SNBA) president Joseph Ong noted that many in the industry would like to return. “They need the nightlife to be vibrant, in order for them to do well ... so we definitely have to bring that part of the business back. But in a safe manner, in a careful manner,” he told CNA. Alcohol suppliers had also told him that sales in supermarkets are “higher than ever before”, Mr Li noted. “People are definitely still drinking, they\\'re just not drinking in restaurants and bars - they are drinking at home. So that for me is the indication that people still need that,” he said. “But definitely, I think here in Singapore, people want to (re-)enter the space in a safe way.\" But first, business owners will need to grit their teeth through the pain, with the latest challenge being Singapore’s Phase 2 (Heightened Alert). As part of the move, a series of measures have been put into place in order to tackle a spike in COVID-19 community cases. One of these measures has been the prohibiting of dining-in, which is currently forbidden from May 16 through Jun 13. Mr Li noted that the latest measures have been an additional challenge to Zouk, which had already changed its business in a number of ways. Pointing to how it had transformed its Capital lounge space into pop-up restaurant Capital Kitchen, Mr Li said that its atmosphere had been a big draw for customers. With dining in not allowed, there is less of an incentive for customers to order food to go, he pointed out. “People were sitting down and they were enjoying themselves and you could hear the sound and stuff, so it was the closest they could get to what Capital was in the past,” he said. “When you take all that away - that social part and then also the music and vibe and stuff and you\\'re just saying okay we\\'re going to deliver you fish and chips …. That is something that\\'s been very, very tough for us.” Mr Ong noted that the current state of play means that some bars and pubs have moved into an “almost shut down” position. IN THE ‘TRIPLE TARGET ZONE’ But even before the newest measures, industry players had already faced a number of struggles, said Mr Ong, who is also founder and managing director of 1-Group, which owns a number of clubs and bars. Karaoke joints, along withpubs and bars without food licences, nightclubs and discotheques, have been shuttered since March 2020as part of Singapore\\'s measures to stem the COVID-19 pandemic. Even as Singapore gradually reopened its economy and allowed most activities to resume, nightlife venues have remained closed due to the higher risk of coronavirus transmission. In October last year, Education Minister Lawrence Wong, who is the co-chair of the multi-ministry task force on COVID-19, noted that the nightlife industry hadto be prepared for “quite a long period of restrictions”. “We know these are higher-risk settings. The nature of the activities themselves, of such activities, means that you have people socialising in close contact, often in a small enclosed space and risk is very much higher,\" said Mr Wong at a multi-ministry task force press conference. “The pandemic frustrates everyone, not just us,\" said Mr Ong. \"Again the problem really for our industry is that we are in that ‘triple target zone’. We are a vibrant place, we are masked down, we basically encourage socialising and all that ... So it is a triple whammy in terms of this is the kind of situation that the authorities want to avoid.” And while some have managed to pivot and reopen as food and beverage outlets, not all have been able to do so successfully. One of SNBA’s goals has been to help businesses pivot as well as exit the market, noted Mr Ong. It had been announcedpreviously that nightlife establishments that wished to pivotto other permissible activities could apply for a grant of up to S$50,000 from Enterprise Singapore (ESG) to defray qualifying costs incurred during the pivoting process, such as equipment and third-party consultancy costs. Nightlife establishments exiting the industry canapply toESGfor an \"ex-gratia\" payment of S$30,000 to defray the costs of the cessation of business. Both of these support schemes areeffective until the end of September. Should they be the recipient ofeither one of the financial support packages, the businesswill not be allowed to participate in the pilot programme or any subsequent resumption of nightlife operations for at least 12 months, the Ministry of Home Affairs had announced previously. SNBA has seen over 400 businesses deciding to pivot, while over 300 have exited the market, said Mr Ong. “Right now, none of us can operate the bars and clubs the way we were doing so … Some of them still hold on to the fact that they possibly can re-open. (But) for many of them, they have already terminated their employees, they have already sent back their entertainers, they are in a very dormant mode,” he added. ‘LOSING LESS IS EARNING’ Pivoting to an F&B business model has been a struggle, said Mr Lu, pointing out that the lack of mechanical and electrical provisions on premises means that it is a struggle to install a full kitchen set-up. “The layout, the furniture - we use sofas and tea tables, which is not suitable for F&B. It is not a good setup for lunch or for dinner,” he added. “As a newcomer, with no professional chef team, no full kitchen and (a) limited variety of food and poor set up for dinner, lunch ... It’s very difficult to catch enough customers.” And despite HaveFun Karaoke pivoting to a F&B model, the revenue generated was not enough to cover operating expenses, and the company’s revenue dropped 90 per cent from pre-COVID times, said Mr Lu. This will be further exacerbated with the current situation, he noted. “As no dine-in (is) allowed under the new restrictions, we can only operate (a) few outlets with take-away services. Revenue will drop dramatically and cash flow will be even more (of a) challenge,” he added. Teo Heng has closed four out of its 14 outlets, said Ms Teo, but has decided not to pivot to an F&B business model. Instead, it set up co-working spaces and study spaces in some of its karaoke rooms, beginning last month. “There are quite a lot of supporters who come in, but, of course, it won\\'t be the same ... as what we did previously,” she said. “This is more or less to help us to bridge over this difficult period … by losing less it is already an earning for us.” Amid the continued pandemic, Mr Ong stressed the need for trials to test the feasibility of businesses operating. “Moving forward, sandboxes will probably be something that we have to push very hard (for), and I\\'m hoping that they will start doing that right after we manage the situation on the ground,” he said. “I believe Singapore needs to adopt this attitude, where we should always be trialing or sandboxing certain entertainment, nightlife activities and all that.” Under a small-scale pilot for the nightlife sector, it was announced in December that three bars and pubs would be allowed to reopen for two months. This pilot was later extended till Apr7. However, another pilot for nightclubs and karaoke outlets to reopen with COVID-19 safety measures in place was deferred until further notice in January. It was slated to start in the same month. Mr Li pointed out that while it was important for nightlight businesses to come back in a safe way, the overall consumer experience would also need to be considered. One of the criteria set by the pilot was that customers entering karaoke lounges and nightclubs would need to test negative for COVID-19 24 hours before the end of the activity at the nightlife establishment. Alcohol also cannot be sold, served or consumed after 10.30pm. “The guests won\\'t come if you tell them you have to have a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test. They\\'re not going to want to do it - I\\'ll just go to a bar, I’ll go to a restaurant, why would I have to go to a club?” asked Mr Li. “It has to be enjoyable as well, because if you\\'re sitting in a group of five, and you can’t listen to music, and you’re going home at 1030 (pm), (you) might as well go to restaurants and do that instead. So how we come back into that space, I think it\\'s definitely going to need to be a discussion between us - the nightlife industry and the authorities.” Mr Lu pointed out that the reopening of licensed entertainment premises with “reasonable” restrictions could help tackle the issue of illegal set ups which he said currently operate in the face of restrictions. “The previous customer base, they do have options for singing and partying. Even during this COVID period, the legal ones are not allowed to open so there are a lot of illegal ones that are outside,” said Mr Lu. Despite the doom and gloom, Mr Ong believes the pandemic presents a “watershed” moment for the industry. “(Now) we can really fully define it and because the slate now is almost clean, we can really redraw what we want and SNBA has a vision - we want Singapore to be the go to lifestyle destination,” he said. “The funny thing about the nightlife businesses is really that you have (the) majority of the operators in the nightlife business being people who view a glass half full rather than half empty. So I believe that ... the nightlife (industry) will come back.\" It looks like the email address you entered is not valid. Copyright© Mediacorp 2021. Mediacorp Pte Ltd.

       " {'text': 'variants versus vaccine covid 19 coronavirus race mutated strain 14925264 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners New variants emerge from large, uncontrolled outbreaks. This is why vaccinating people is an urgent priority, says Duke-NUS Medical School’s Professor Gavin Smith. SINGAPORE: Variants of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, may be outpacing vaccination progress in many parts of the world, fuelling fears of new outbreaks. Scientists around the world are tracking these variants to understand whether some spread faster than others, how they might affect our healthand how effective current vaccines might be against them. Evidence is now emerging that some mutations can make a virus spread more easily, while other mutations are associated with a reduction in how effective a vaccine might be in preventing infection. But even if vaccine efficacy is lowered against certain variants, the vaccine will still protect against infection, hospitalisation and death. Some variants are more deadly but others, like the B117 first identified in the UK, look the same as the parent in terms of fatality. VARIANTS A NATURAL RESULT OF VIRUS EVOLUTION Variants emerge because viruses like SARS-CoV-2 are constantly changing or mutating as a normal part of the virus’ evolution. Mutations occur when the virus makes a mistake while copying itself (called replication) during an active infection. Most mutations have no effect on virus behaviour, but some can make the virus more transmissible. For example, a mutation might allow the virus to grow better in the nose and throat compared to deep in the lungs. You would expect the virus variant growing in the nose to be more easily spread because it is more likely to be expelled during sneezing and coughing. This is just one example of how a mutation can change the behaviour of a virus, in this case transmissibility. But at the moment, we still can’t say much about the effects of most mutations we observe in SARS-CoV-2 with great certainty. It looks like the email address you entered is not valid. SCIENTIFIC ACHIEVEMENTS IN SEQUENCING HELPS US DEAL WITH VARIANTS BETTER The unprecedented amount of virus genome sequencing conducted in this pandemic, however, has been a major scientific achievement, giving us an overall view of how this virus is changing over time. Since the start of the pandemic, more than 1.5 million SARS-CoV-2 genomes have been sequenced. To put this in context, during the first year of the 2009 influenza pandemic less than 10,000 genomes were produced and that was a huge achievement at thattime. The sequencing data provides an opportunity to scrutinise every small change in the virus genomes, and to identify variants through laboratory study and clinical correlation, though this alone can’t tell us what effect a mutation might have. Out of all this sequencing data, the World Health Organisation (WHO) distinguishes Variants of Interest (VOI) if they show some sort of changed behaviour, such as causing more severe disease, or if they possess mutations known to change the nature of the virus, such as how easily the virus can be transmitted. Variants must cause a community outbreak or circulate in multiple countries before they are flagged as a VOI. A VOI gets upgraded to a Variant of Concern (VOC) if there is substantial evidence for higher virus transmission or virulence, or if there is an impact on vaccines and drugs used to treat COVID-19. (Are COVID-19 vaccines still effective against new variants? And could these increase the risk of reinfection? Experts explain why COVID-19 could become a “chronic problem\" on CNA\\'s Heart of the Matter podcast.) NEED TO CONTROL OUTBREAKS TO PREVENT MORE VARIANTS FROM EMERGING Mutations occur naturally during an infection. Hence, it is unsurprising these variants of interest and concern have all emerged from large, uncontrolled outbreaks. When a new virus enters humans with no existing immunity, the virus can run rampant, infecting millions of people. This has happened in many countries, and we have seen new variants discovered in the United Kingdom, South Africa and the United States when they were experiencing unchecked epidemics, and more recently from Brazil, India and Vietnam. We can expect to see more variants emerge over time before enough of the global population are vaccinated or immune from previous infection. The good news is that the vaccines are still working so far even against the new variants, and we can expect them to remain effective for the foreseeable future. A recently published study shows that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is still 88 per cent effective against the B16172 variant associated with the outbreak in India, down from 93 per cent effectiveness against the earlier B117 variant. The effectiveness in preventing hospitalisation and death would be even higher. CONTROLLING INFECTION THROUGH VACCINATION The only way we can move out of this pandemic is when the population globally has some level of immunity against the SARS-COV-2 virus. There are two ways to achieve this – through natural infection or through vaccination. Natural infection runs the risk of severe sickness and death. COVID-19 kills 2 per cent of infected people globally, which would equate to more than 100,000 people in Singapore. These numbers might seem small but imagine if one of those people was your loved one. The good news is that we now have not just one but a whole range of safe and effective vaccines. These vaccines represent our best chance of getting out of this pandemic without adding significantly to the estimated 3.5 million deaths that have occurred globally. While vaccines are very effective at preventing infection, in the event that a vaccinated person is infected, being vaccinated will protect him from dying orgetting very sick and reduces the risk of transmission. So the best way to stop new variants emerging is to stop people from getting infected. And currently the best chance we have to stop infection and reduce transmission is to get as many people vaccinated as quickly as possible.

       " {'text': 'covid 19 wrong moderna vaccination student measures tightened 14948914 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: Measures have been tightened to ensure that people are not given the wrong COVID-19 vaccine, said Education Minister Chan Chun Sing on Friday (Jun 4). This comes after a first dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine was wrongly administered to a 16-year-old studenton Thursday at Kolam Ayer Community Club vaccination centre.The vaccine is currently authorised for use in Singapore for those aged 18 and above. The student\\'s date of birth was \"erroneously entered\" when he was bookingan appointment, and itresulted in his age being incorrectly registered as above 18 years old,said the Ministry of Health (MOH) and Ministry of Education (MOE) in a joint statement early Friday morning. The ministries added that vaccination centre staff members had failed to verify his age during registration. \"Since yesterdaywe\\'ve done a thorough debrief with the MOH team, and they have tightened up the measures to make sure that this mistake of not thoroughly verifying before the vaccination is not repeated,” said Mr Chan on Friday afternoon. Staff members from MOHwill also look at the registration process to see how chances of a wrong entry can be minimised, he added. “But having said that, the finallayer of checks must be on the ground, whereby prior to the vaccination, the staff will check and verify the IC number, the allergies, the age profile of the person coming in for the vaccination. So we\\'ve also issued instructions, particularly to all the centres offering Moderna,” said the Education Minister. “It is less of an issue for the centres offering Pfizer because Pfizer is given to be used for all age groups. But for Moderna, thus far we have not gotten the HSA (Health Sciences Authority) approval for that.\" The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine has beenapproved for use in Singapore for children aged 12 to 15. Students below 18 years old will only be offered the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, while people aged 18 and above can opt for either thePfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines. “We want to make sure that all the Moderna centres put in an extra layer of checks to make sure that whoever goes to the Moderna centres is eligible for the Moderna vaccine,\" Mr Chan added. The error in giving the 16-year-old studentthe Moderna vaccine was discovered during the post-vaccinationobservation period when vaccination centre staff members identified that the boy was under 18. He was placed under a longer observation time of 50 minutes as an additional precaution and \"remains generally well\", said the ministries early Friday morning. The boy’s parents are “calm”, and the ministries are working with his family to support them and are makingsure \"the health and well-being of the child is well taken care of”, said Mr Chan on Friday. VACCINATION REGISTRATION NUMBERS The response rate to the invitations to register for vaccinations has been“very positive”, said the Education Minister. Mr Chan was speaking to reporters at ITE College Central, one of the four dedicated vaccination centres forthe student vaccination exercise. Students in graduating cohorts - those taking their GCE N- O- or A-Level exams this year, were among the first to receive their invitations. More than five in six of such students have already registered for vaccinations, said Mr Chan. Registration for vaccinations has also been opened up to polytechnic students and other pre-university students, he added. This comprises JC 1 students and non-graduating cohorts of Millennia Institute. Of this batch, more than three in four of these students have already registered for vaccinations, said Mr Chan. A third tranche of invitations to register for vaccinations hasalso sent outto students from Secondary 1 to Secondary 3, as well asPrimary 6 students who are 12 years old,he added. “We are very encouraged by the response rate so far,” said the Education Minister. The MOE vaccination centre at ITE College Central will be operational from Monday, while the three other dedicated vaccination centresat ITE College West, ITE College East and Raffles City Convention Centre will start operations in the coming weeks, said Mr Chan. All four centres will offer only the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, he added. The vaccination exercise for students is expected to be completed by August, the Education Ministry said on May 31, when it announced the exercise. Responding to a question about whether measures in schools, such as wearing masks,may be relaxed after the vaccination exercise, Mr Chan said: “I think we take that from the prevailing protocols that MOH will advise (on).\" “There are a lot of safe management measures that we must emphasise, that we must continue to adhere to, notwithstanding the vaccination rate. We must never ever be complacent,\" he added.

       " {'text': 'us eases travel recommendations 110 countries singapore 14974224 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners WASHINGTON:The USCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has eased travel recommendations for more than 110 countries and territories, including Singapore. TheCDC\\'s new ratings, first reported by Reuters and posted on aCDCwebsite on Monday (Jun 8), include 61 nations that were lowered from its highest \"Level 4\" rating that discouraged all travel to recommending travel for fully vaccinated individuals, the agency confirmed on Tuesday. An additional 50 countries and territories have been lowered to \"Level 2\" or \"Level 1\",aCDCspokeswoman said. Countries ranked lowest for COVID-19 risks now include Singapore, Israel, South Korea, Iceland, Belize and Albania. Among those now listed at \"Level 3\",are France, Ecuador, the Philippines, South Africa, Canada, Mexico, Russia, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine, Honduras, Hungary and Italy. The USState Department said it had updated its recommendations to reflect the recent methodology update, but noted not all ratings were revised because of other factors including \" commercial flight availability, restrictions on UScitizen entry, and impediments to obtaining COVID test results within three calendar days\". The State Department eased its ratings on 85 countries and territories, including Japan. On May 24, the State Department had urged against travel to Japan, citing a new wave of coronavirus cases before the Tokyo Olympics are set to begin on Jul23. The State Department warning raised concerns and prompted the White House to reaffirm its support for Tokyo\\'s plan to hold the Games this summer and for USathletes competing there despite a new wave of infections and a low vaccination rate in the host country. Foreign spectators have been banned, and organisers are expected to make a decision late this month on domestic spectators. REVISED CRITERIA TheCDCsaid the change came after it revised its criteria for travel health notices. TheCDCsaid it also revised its rating for the United States to \"Level 3\" from \"Level 4\". The agency said the new criteria for a Level 4 \"avoid all travel\" recommendation has changed to 500 cases per 100,000 from 100 COVID-19 cases per 100,000. The agency added that many countries have lower ratings \"because of the criteria changes or because their outbreaks are better controlled\".TheCDCsaid it expects more countries to get lower, more favourable travel ratings. Other countries being lowered to \"Level 3\" include Honduras, Indonesia, Jordan, Libya, Panama, Poland, Denmark and Malaysia. Many of the countries that now have lower ratings remain on the USgovernment\\'s list of countries subject to severe travel restrictions - and most have been subject to the restrictions since early 2020. The United States bars nearly all non-UScitizens who have within the previous 14 days been to China, the United Kingdom, Ireland, India, South Africa, Brazil, Iran and the 26 Schengen nations in Europe without border controls. Asked why the United States is maintaining the restrictions even though some countries that now have low infection rates are subject to them, while others with high rates are exempt,CDCDirector Rochelle Walensky said on Tuesday the issue was subject to \"an interagency conversation, and we are looking at the data in real time as to how we should move forward with that\". Reuters reported on Tuesday the Biden administration is forming expert working groups with Canada, Mexico, the European Union and the UK to determine how best to restart travel safely after 15 months of pandemic restrictions, citing a White House official.

For 14 months, King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuckhas been travelling by foot, car and horse to remote hamlets to oversee measures to protect his tiny kingdom of 700,000 from the coronavirus outbreak that has flared up in neighbouring India. The impact of the 41-year-old king\\'s excursions are evident in a COVID-19 death toll of just one for the nation nestled between India and China in the Eastern Himalayas. \"When the king travels for miles and knocks ... to alert people about the pandemic, then his humble words are respected and taken very seriously,\" said Lotay Tshering, the country\\'s prime minister. \"His Majesty\\'s presence is far more powerful than just issuing public guidelines,\" Tshering told Reuters. His presence assures people they are not alone in their fight against the pandemic, the prime minister said. Tshering, a practicing urologist, often accompanies the Oxford-educated king for trips near the porous border shared with India, where a second wave of the pandemic more than doubled the death toll over the last two months. Bhutan became a constitutional monarchy in 2008 when the king relinquished his absolute powers. But loyalty to the royal family still dominates the nation\\'s socio-political landscape. In recent weeks, the king walked for five days on a trail passing through elevations of up to 4,343m to thank primary health workers in remote areas. The king\\'s office declined a request for an interview but his social media pages on Instagram and Facebook showcase his work and travels during the pandemic. \"Our king\\'s biggest fear is that if the pandemic spreads like a forest fire then our (nation) could be wiped out,\" said a senior palace official. A father of two boys, after every trip the king checks into a hotel in capital Thimphu to follow quarantine protocols. Like most of his subjects, he has received one vaccination dose. \"(The king) has been to all high risk border areas time and again to monitor every measure put in place and to ensure best practices are followed within limited resources,\" said Rui Paulo de Jesus, the World Health Organization representative in Bhutan. Bhutan, an ancient kingdom sealed off to foreigners until the 1970s, has just one doctor available for every 2,000 people. The borders of the scenic nation are now shut again and domestic lockdowns have been imposed in some areas, while screening and testing for COVID-19 have been stepped up. Prime Minister Tshering has said Bhutan is looking to mix-and-match vaccine doses because after inoculating 90per cent of its eligible population with their first dose of the AstraZeneca shot, the nation ran out of supplies. The deadline to administer the second dose after a gap of 12 weeks is this month, and the government is seeking other supplies to deal with the shortage.

The police said they received a report May 18 that information about the suspension of sport, physical activity classes and programmes catering to children and youth aged 18 years and below from May 19 until Jun 13 had been leaked to the public. This occurred before the information was officially released by Sport Singapore, the police said in a news release on Sunday (May 30). \"Preliminary investigations revealed that the man, who is a public servant and an authorised recipient of the safe management measures for sport and physical activities, had allegedly shared the information via WhatsApp on May 16 with members of a private WhatsApp chat group who were not authorised to receive the classified information,\" said the police. The information was further disseminated by other members from the chat group, resulting in the wider circulation of the classified information before it was officially released. Since the start of the pandemic, at least six people have been charged under the OSA for unauthorised or wrongful communication of information. In May, a Housing and Development Board officer was among two men charged over unauthorised communication of information about flat inspections. Kalayarasan Karuppaya, a higher estate executive with HDB at the time of the offences, had allegedly leaked information on HDB’s impending inspections of a flat at Kim Tian Road to Damandeep Singh, a registered tenant of the unit. Kalayarasan was not authorised to communicate the information to Damandeep, but allegedly did so on three occasions in May, August and September 2019. Chua Wee Lin, who at the time held the position of deputy director at the National Library Board\\'s property and facilities management department, was also charged in May with sending information about Phase 2 reopening measures to a WhatsApp chat group with 18 other members in it. In April, a couple was charged withleaking an unreleased statement about school closures during the COVID-19 \"circuit breaker\"last year. Noorain Jubli, who was the personal assistant to theSFA director-generalat the time of the offences,wascharged withtwo counts of wrongful communication of information. SFA suspended her from her duties in April 2020. Her husband Khairul Annuar Zakaria was also given two charges under the OSA for wrongful communication and soliciting information. That same month, Zhao Zheng, then deputy lead of MOH\\'s Data Management Unit, was given more than 20 charges after she allegedly leaked the daily COVID-19 casenumbers before they were officially released to a private group chat on 22 occasions in 2020. Those found guilty of wrongful communication of information under the OSA face a fine of up to S$2,000 and up to two years’ jail. The police said unauthorised recipients should delete and not further circulate any confidential information received, as they may otherwise be similarly liable under the Official Secrets Act.

This came aftera record-breaking 20,574 new COVID-19 cases the day before, with Jakarta logging a record of 7,505 infections. Speaking during a press conference, the minister said thatPersahabatan hospital, Sulianti Saroso hospital and Fatmawati hospital, all in the capital city,will be converted into full COVID-19 hospitals. The government is also readying new makeshift COVID-19 hospitals in Jakarta. They will be located within the government subsidised housing complexes ofNagrak and Pasar Rumput. These makeshift facilities willtreat asymptomatic patients and those with mild symptoms. Meanwhile, Jakarta’s 2018 Asian Games Athlete\\'sVillage, which since last year has been turned into an emergency COVID-19 makeshift hospital, will treat patients with severe symptoms. “Thus, we will have hundreds of new beds with full equipment(as well as) experienced doctors and nurses to treat COVID-19 patients in Jakarta. “And we hope, this week the conversion will be finished so it can add the number of beds to treat Jakartans,\"Mr Sadikinsaid. He added that emergency rooms in Jakarta\\'s hospitals will also be converted into COVID-19 isolation rooms, while tents outside the hospitals will be set up to serve as emergency rooms. Mr Sadikin statedthat the country has85,000 hospital beds, excluding the new COVID-19 hospitals and isolation rooms in Jakarta. He said that60,000 beds are currently occupied. The minister also commented onlocal media reports that some hospitals in Java are about to run out of oxygen. He said that of Indonesia’s total oxygen production capacity, 25 per cent is used for medical purposes and the rest is for industries. He addedthat producers are willing to support the health sectorif needed. Indonesia is battling an influx of COVID-19 cases following last month’s Idul Fitri holiday where people returned to their hometowns and throngs of people crowded tourist spots.

When safe-distancing ambassadors approached the group and asked them to stop mingling, the man turned aggressive and cursed at them. Idumehdrah Arumugam, 44, was fined S$6,500 for his acts on Friday (Jun 11). He pleaded guilty to one charge each of meeting others for a non-permitted purpose and using abusive words towards an auxiliary police officer. Another two charges were considered in sentencing. The court heard that Idumehdrah gathered with nine other people at Newton Food Centre at about 2pm on Oct 11, 2020 to celebrate a birthday. Idumehdrah consumed a large amount of alcohol with the others, said the prosecutor. Members of the public informed safe-distancing ambassadors and an auxiliary police officer tasked with enforcing COVID-19 rules about the gathering. The officer and two ambassadors approached the group at 5.10pm and saw them mingling, failing to maintain safe distancing and smoking under a shelter in front of a stall. The officer advised the group to stop mingling and to adhere to safe-distancing, but the group ignored him. When he advised them again, Idumehdrah suddenly turned aggressive. He told him \"go f*** off from here\" and told one of the ambassadors multiple times to \"f*** off\". He was openly aggressive towards the officer and the two ambassadors, and had to be held back by other members of the group. One of the ambassadors lodged a police report. The victims disengaged themselvesfrom the group to prevent the matter from escalating further, but the group dispersed and left before the police arrived. For breaching a COVID-19 regulation, Idumehdrah could have been jailed up to six months, fined up to S$10,000, or both. For using abusive words on a public servant, he could have been jailed up to a year, fined up to S$5,000, or both. It looks like the email address you entered is not valid. Copyright© Mediacorp 2021.
