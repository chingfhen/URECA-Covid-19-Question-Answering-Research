       "[{'text': 'Requirements for Safe Management Measures at the workplace Read the sector-specific guidelines and infographic on Safe Management Measures at the workplace. From 16 May 2021 to 13 June 2021, the Safe Management Measures for the workplace will be tightened. Previously, up to 50% of employees28 who are able to work from home could be at the workplace at any time. Now, employers must ensure that all employees who are able to work from home do so. Social gatherings at the workplace are disallowed. These measures help lower transmission risks by reducing the levels of interaction at common spaces at or near the workplace, and in public places, including public transport. Issued on 9 May 2020 Updated as of 14 May 2021 The tripartite partners (MOM, SNEF, and NTUC) have updated the workplace safe management measures to allow greater flexibility for businesses, while mitigating the risk of widespread COVID-19 transmission. Effective implementation of these measures will help to avoid having to impose tighter measures. These requirements are meant for general workplace settings. Specific workplaces like construction worksites and shipyards may have to fulfil additional requirements and should refer to sector-specific requirements1. Agencies including MOM, Building and Construction Authority (BCA) and Enterprise Singapore (ESG) will continue to enforce safe management measures and take action against errant employers. This may include issuing stop-work orders and financial penalties. Safe Management Measures To ensure COVID-safe workplaces, employers should take care of: Your workers; Your workplaces; and Those who may become unwell at your workplaces. A. Take care of your workers Provide employees options to work from home. From 16 May 2021 to 13 June 2021, employers must exercise heightened vigilance at the workplace. Employers must ensure that all employees who are able to work from home do so. Employers are encouraged to support as many employees in working from home as possible. This will help to limit the number of employees exposed at the workplace at any point in time, and reduce crowding in common areas, e.g. pantries, toilets, lifts. Having more employees work from home will also help sustain business operations should a case emerge at the workplace. Work-from-home measures should enable employees to maintain work-life harmony while continuing to meet business needs. The Tripartite Advisory on mental well-being at workplaces sets out practical guidance on measures that employers can adopt to support their employees’ mental well-being under a variety of work arrangements. For employees who are still unable to work from home, employers should review work processes, provide the necessary IT equipment to employees and adopt solutions that enable remote working and online collaboration. Employers are encouraged to leverage technology2 to ensure business continuity and safe management. Companies should continue to conduct virtual meetings as far as possible. Companies should pay special attention to vulnerable employees3 (e.g. persons who are aged 60 and above, and patients who are immunocompromised4 or have concurrent medical conditions). Employers are encouraged to enable these employees to work-from-home, allow them to travel to/from work at off-peak timings, temporarily redeploy them to another role within the company, or take other appropriate measures to reduce their exposure to infection risk. For employees at the workplace, employers must ensure the following precautions are in place: Stagger start times and allow flexible workplace hours5: This will spread out staff across time and place, and reduces possible congregation of employees at common spaces at or near the workplace, such as entrances, exits, lobbies, canteens, pantries. It also reduces congestion of people in public places, including public transport. Employers are encouraged to stagger the start times for all employees such that at least half of all employees arrive at the workplace at or after 10am, as far as possible. If physical meetings are needed, they can be scheduled after 10 am. These measures would enable more employees to avoid peak-hour travel, especially if employees require the use of public transport. Timings of lunch and other breaks should also be staggered accordingly. If it is not feasible to implement staggered start times, flexible workplace hours, and staggered break hours due to operational reasons (e.g. manufacturing production line activities), employers must implement other systemic arrangements to reduce congregation of employees at common spaces6. No cross-deployment across worksites7: No employee should work at more than one worksite. If cross-deployment cannot be avoided (e.g. due to the nature of the job), additional safeguards must be taken to minimise the risk of cross infection8. Employers should avoid organising work-related events unless critical (e.g. training session): All work-related events9 that proceed must adhere to prevailing workplace Safe Management Measures and are subjected to the following requirements10: The number of persons per event must be capped at 50 persons to limit the risk of exposure to infection. Attendees must maintain at least 1 metre safe distancing between individual attendees, as per the requirement at the workplace. Food and drinks are not allowed at work-related events. Work-related events at third-party venues11 will also be subject to any additional premise owners’ safe management policies. Social gatherings at the workplace are disallowed: Employees should have their meal breaks at the workplace individually. Wear masks at the workplace: Employers must ensure that all onsite personnel, including employees, visitors, suppliers and contractors, wear a mask and other necessary personal protective equipment13 at all times at the workplace, except during activities that require masks to be removed14. Masks will have to be worn immediately after the activity is completed. Employers should ensure that they have sufficient masks for all employees, including any need to replace masks more frequently due to workplace conditions15. Where possible, employers should consider improving the working environment for employees to enable them to sustain wearing the masks. Observe good personal hygiene: Employers should encourage their employees to observe good personal hygiene, e.g. wash their hands regularly and refrain from touching their face. B. Take care of the workplace Control access at the workplace to only essential employees and authorised visitors. Employers must use the SafeEntry visitor management system to record the entry of all personnel (including employees and visitors) entering the workplace16. All employees and visitors should check-in and check-out of workplaces using SafeEntry (with their TraceTogether app or token) to help MOH in establishing potential transmission chains. Personnel who are unwell (including having a fever upon temperature screening) must be refused entry to the workplace. Visitors who are unwell should be asked to reschedule their appointments to another day when they are well, or be served via alternate means.17 Employers must ensure that employees and visitors must declare via SafeEntry or other means18 (e.g. electronic or hard copy records), before being allowed to enter premises, that they: Are currently not under a Quarantine Order, Stay-Home Notice; Have not had close contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case in the past 14 days19; and Do not have any fever or flu-like symptoms. Adhere to travel advisories: Employers should ensure that their employees adhere to MOH’s prevailing travel advisory. Where physical interaction cannot be avoided, precautions should be taken to ensure clear physical spacing of at least 1 metre through physical means20 and demarcation of safe physical distances (at least 1m apart) using visual indicators, where possible, in the following situations21: Between all persons at meeting rooms, work areas, and workstations; and At all times during work-related events held at the workplace. Employers who are service buyers should also require their suppliers / contractors to implement similar safe distancing measures, so that operations and business interactions with these suppliers / contractors are kept safe. Where physical interactions are still necessary, e.g. delivery of goods, employers must adopt precautionary measures such as scheduling delivery times by different suppliers in a staggered manner. The durations of such transactions should be kept as short as possible. Minimise need for physical touchpoints: Employers should reduce the occurrences of, or need for common physical touchpoints in the workplace where possible (e.g. by deploying contactless access controls). Where physical contact is needed, additional safeguards must be taken to minimise the risk of cross infection (e.g. frequent disinfection of touchpoints). Step up cleaning of workplace premises through the following: Employers must ensure regular cleaning of common spaces, particularly areas with high human contact22. Where physical meetings are held or meals are taken at common spaces such as pantries or canteens, employers must clean and disinfect tables between each meeting or seating. Employers must ensure that machinery and equipment shared between different employees across different shifts or alternate teams are cleaned and disinfected before changing hands. The sanitation and hygiene advisories23 disseminated by the National Environmental Agency (NEA) must be adhered to. Provide cleaning and disinfecting agents at the following areas: Cleaning agents (e.g. liquid soap, toilet paper) must be available at all toilets and hand-wash stations. Disinfecting agents (e.g. hand sanitisers) must be installed at all human traffic stoppage points within the workplace, such as entrances, reception areas, security booths and lift lobbies. Disinfecting agents (e.g. disinfectant sprays, paper towels and wipes) must be provided at meeting rooms and other common spaces such as pantries or canteens. C. Take care of workers who become unwell at the workplace Ensure regular checks for temperature and respiratory symptoms24 for all onsite employees and visitors, twice daily or where relevant. Employers must be able to demonstrate that these checks are in place during inspections. Record proximity data on phones: To help MOH to more quickly identify potential close contacts of COVID-19 patients and reduce disease transmission, employers should encourage all employees to download and activate the TraceTogether app25. Actively monitor unwell employees and guard against incipient outbreaks: Employees at the workplace who have visited a clinic must submit to their employers records of their MCs and diagnoses provided (only for COVID-19-related symptoms, including acute respiratory infections), and if they were tested for COVID-19 and the results of their tests. Employers must take preventive action to guard against incipient outbreaks at the workplace, such as advising employees who are unwell to stay home and consult a doctor rather than going to the workplace, requiring these employees on MCs to closely monitor their health before returning to the workplace and requiring these employees’ close contacts at the workplace to monitor their health more regularly. Where possible, employers should ensure that each employee visits only one clinic for check-ups if unwell. Otherwise, employees should inform the clinic of all recent doctor visits over past 14 days for any symptoms that may be related to COVID-1926. Manage unwell cases: An evacuation plan must be prepared for unwell or suspected cases, as well as for other onsite personnel. Any employee who is feeling unwell or showing symptoms of illness should report to his employer, leave the workplace and consult a doctor immediately, even if symptoms may appear mild. Employers must track and record these cases as part of Safe Management Measures. For incapacitated or unconscious individuals, employers must clear the area of other personnel and administer aid immediately. Employers should call 995 for an emergency ambulance to ferry them to the nearest hospital. Manage confirmed cases: A follow-up plan must be put in place in the event of a confirmed case. Upon being notified of a confirmed case, employers must adopt the following precautionary measures: Immediately vacate and cordon-off the immediate section of the workplace premises where the confirmed case worked. There is no need to vacate the building or the whole floor if there had been no sustained and close contact with the confirmed case; and Carry out a thorough cleaning and disinfecting all relevant on-site areas and assets that were exposed to confirmed cases, in accordance to NEA guidelines. For worksites with confirmed cases, businesses could be suspended if there are public health grounds. D. Implement a system of Safe Management Measures Employers must establish a system to implement the above Safe Management Measures to provide a safe working environment and minimise risks of COVID-19 outbreaks. These measures must be implemented in a sustainable manner for as long as necessary. Implement a detailed monitoring plan to ensure compliance with Safe Management Measures and timely resolution of outstanding issues27. Appoint Safe Management Officer(s) (“SMO”) to assist in the implementation, coordination and monitoring of the system of Safe Management Measures at the workplace. For unionised companies, union leaders or WSH officers could be appointed as SMOs. Employers must provide appointed SMOs with adequate instruction, information and supervision as is necessary for them to fulfil their required duties. SMOs are strongly encouraged to receive training. The duties of the Officer(s) include: To coordinate implementation of Safe Management Measures, including identifying relevant risks, recommending and assisting in implementing measures to mitigate the risks, and communicating the measures to all personnel working in the workplace; To conduct inspections and checks, to ensure compliance at all times. Any non-compliance found during the inspections should be reported and documented; To remedy non-compliance found during the inspections and checks through immediate action; and To keep records of inspections, checks and correction actions, to be made available upon request by a Government Inspector. Employers must ensure that the measures above are in place, communicated and explained to employees prior to resuming work onsite (refer to Annex B for a checklist of Safe Management Measures that should be in place for resumption of business activities). Signs should also be put up to remind employees and visitors to observe all measures in place. Unionised companies should engage their unions on such arrangements. Employees should also do their part in adhering to the measures to create a safe working environment. Those who wish to report breaches or poor practices can do so via SnapSAFE, an app that allows the reporting of workplace safety and health issues to MOM. You may refer to the frequently asked questions on Safe Management Measures at the workplace after Circuit Breaker period.

More info about the various sector-specific requirements. Annex A provides a list of resources such as technology solutions and grants available to assist companies. Those who have a compromised or impaired immune system. Workplace hours here refers to the hours spent at the physical workplace. E.g. arrange for different groups of employees to arrive / depart through different entrances / exits. This will not apply to industries / companies that need to do so due to the nature of their work. Such companies will be required to demonstrate that cross-deployment or interaction between employees is critical for business operations, when requested by MOM or their sector agencies. E.g. systems are in place to ensure no direct contact between the cross-deployed personnel. I.e. events not organised primarily for social interaction. Work-related events that are allowed to proceed are those which primarily involve employees or stakeholders, such as conferences / seminars, corporate retreats, staff training sessions, Annual General Meetings and Extraordinary General Meetings. This is separate and distinct from MICE events approved by the Singapore Tourism Board (STB). Work-related events are allowed to resume at third-party venues, but are subject to any additional premise owners’ safe management policies. <nil> Masks for general office workplaces; for other workplace settings, please refer to sector-specific guidelines. The requirement for masks to be worn can be waived when carrying out, in the course of employment, an activity that requires that no mask may be worn, or that it must be removed in order that other equipment may be worn or used, to carry out that activity, or when riding a motorcycle in the course of employment or otherwise. E.g. humid workplaces, call centres where the nature of the work may necessitate frequent mask changing. For the full list of workplaces where SafeEntry must be deployed, please refer to Such as tele-conferencing. Not applicable for individuals seeking treatment at a medical facility. Not applicable to COVID-19 frontline workers or recovered individuals within 3 months of their first positive PCR COVID-19 test. E.g. barriers between workstations, relocation of workstations, meeting room seats. The monitoring and enforcement of safe distancing could be aided by appropriate technology (e.g. CCTVs, video analytics) where possible. Such as counters where customers are served, rooms where visitors are hosted, as well as general public access areas such as lifts, pantries, toilets, and bin areas (including bin centres where necessary). Including coughing, sneezing, breathlessness, a runny nose, or loss of sense of smell. Data recorded by TraceTogether is stored on the user’s device, and is shared with MOH for contact-tracing purposes when the user is suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19. Including but not limited to typical symptoms such as fever, cough and shortness of breath. E.g. follow-up on non-compliance and efforts to mitigate risks.

This document provides the conditions under which religious organisations (ROs) are permitted to carry out activities in places of worship during this period of Phase Two (Heightened Alert). Phase Two (Heightened Alert) Under Phase Three (Heightened Alert) that began on 8 May 2021, enhanced precautionary measures were imposed on religious activities, namely a decrease in capacity for congregational and other worship services from 250 persons to 100 persons, without pre-event testing (PET), and no congregational singing. Under Phase Two (Heightened Alert), from 16 May through 13 June 2021, tighter measures will apply to religious activities. To reduce risks of community transmission, indoor “mask-off” activities will cease during this period. We will also further reduce the current permissible group size from up to 5 persons, to up to 2 persons. The new measures are as follows: a. Congregational and other worship services will be limited to 100 persons (decrease from 250 persons today) i. Up to 50 persons without PET; ii. Up to 100 persons with PET for all attendees; b. No singing and playing of wind/brass instruments for live performance elements; c. Suspension of all other non-congregational religious activities, except for religious rites; and d. Reduced capacity for marriage solemnizations as well as wakes, funerals and post-funeral rites. Annex A summarises the key changes for ROs going from Phase Three (Heightened Alert) to Phase Two (Heightened Alert). Worship Services From 16 May 2021, ROs may conduct congregational and other worship services at places of worship, with up to 50 persons at a time without PET, subject to safe management measures and the safe capacity of the premises. Religious and supporting workers should be kept to a minimum. Worshippers can participate in worship services in groups of no more than 2 persons (decrease from 5 persons today), in line with prevailing national requirements. ROs can conduct congregational and other worship services, for more than 50 persons and up to 100 persons at a time, only if there is PET for all worshippers1 as follows: a. ROs must ensure that all worshippers [except where paragraph (b) below applies] obtain a negative COVID-19 test result before they may be admitted into the venue where the service is being held.2 i. The test must be an MOH-approved COVID-19 test (either an Antigen Rapid Test (ART) or Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test) administered by an approved test provider.3 ii. The test results are only valid for 24 hours from the time an individual registers at the testing premises to take the test. The RO must ensure that the result of the test is valid until the end of the worshipper’s participation in the worship service. iii. The worshipper must be able to produce proof of the test result, which are either (i) Check-in Successful banner (displayed on the SafeEntry (Business) application upon scanning with TraceTogether App/Token), (ii) COVID-19 Test Result Notice (ART), (iii) COVID-19 Test Result Notice (PCR), or (iv) Patient Risk Profile Portal (PRPP) ART Result Slip. b. The requirements for PET in paragraph 6(a) above do not apply to worshippers who have been vaccinated4 or produce an exemption notice5. Before being admitted into the venue where the service is being held, the worshipper must produce valid documentation of either their vaccination or exemption notice which must remain valid until the end of the worshipper’s participation in the service. c. Where PET is required for a service, ROs must prominently display signs at each point of entry and exit (including emergency exit) to the venue where the service is being held, to indicate: i. The space is a restricted place6, and the duration for which it will be a restricted place (i.e. the duration of the service). ROs must clearly mark the boundaries of the restricted place (e.g. though fencing, rope, signs, walls, partition, screen). ii. That entry and remaining within the restricted place is allowed only to individuals with a cleared status (i.e. have a valid negative COVID-19 test result notice, valid documentation of vaccination or exemption notice). d. ROs are to highlight to worshippers attending services for more than 50 persons and up to 100 persons that they will be denied entry into the venue where the service is being held if they do not produce the relevant negative COVID-19 test result notice, vaccination notice, or exemption notice, with the necessary validity period. For congregational and other worship services exceeding 50 persons and up to 100 persons with PET, worshippers have to be segregated into zones holding no more than 50 persons each. a. As there should be no mingling of individuals across zones, each zone must be completely separated from another by either a physical solid partition (at least 1.8m high if not floor-to-ceiling, from wall-to-wall); or at least 3m physical spacing demarcated by continuous physical barriers (e.g. rope barrier). b. There must either be a separate ingress/egress for each zone or staggered entrance/exit timings so that worshippers from different zones do not mix with one another during entry/exit. c. ROs must also take reasonable steps to ensure that worshippers do not cross the physical barrier (where applicable) or enter another zone that they are not assigned to. ROs should continue to observe the following safe management measures for worship services (including services conducted with PET): a. Keep worship services to as short a duration as possible. There must be no reception or mingling between worshippers, before, during or after each worship service. b. All persons present (except children below 6 years of age) must wear a face mask at all times.7 Face shields are not permitted as substitutes for face masks. Young children are still strongly encouraged to use a mask, especially when they are in a group setting (e.g. attending worship service). c. Live performance elements are permitted during the worship service at places of worship, with the following safe management measures (see Annex B for details). i. A maximum of 30 persons are allowed to be involved in/support the conduct of the worship service. This includes persons on-stage, backstage or off-stage. ii. Unmasking will not be permitted. To ensure the safety of worshippers, singing or playing of wind/brass instruments will also not be permitted. iii. Singing (with or without the mask on) is not allowed. iv. Masks must be worn when speaking during congregational and other worship services. A face shield is not a permitted substitute for a proper mask. v. There must be at least a 3-metre setback between persons involved in the conduct of live performance elements and worshippers. vi. Minimise the duration of live performance elements for congregational and other worship services. d. There should be no sharing of prayer and other common items (e.g. holy books, passing of offertory baskets, prayer mats) as this increases the risk of COVID-19 transmission. Worshippers are to bring along their personal prayer items instead, where required. e. Places of worship with reduced air circulation (e.g. enclosed prayer spaces, air-conditioned worship hall) should, where possible, open doors and windows to naturally ventilate the space after each use. Marriage Solemnizations From 16 May 2021, ROs may continue to use places of worship to conduct marriage solemnizations where: a. Solemnizations involving up to 50 attendees: PET will not be required. b. Solemnizations involving between 51 - 100 attendees: PET will be required for all attendees.8 c. These activities are subject to safe management measures and the safe capacity of the premises, and exclude the solemnizer and religious and supporting workers, whose numbers should be kept to a minimum. d. If the total number of attendees is more than 50 (including the wedding couple), they must still be segregated into zones of up to 50 persons each (see paragraph 7 for zoning requirements). An individual attending the solemnization must remain within his or her respective assigned zone and must not enter an unassigned zone. e. Attendees must maintain a 1-metre safe distance between groups except a core “wedding party”9, which is allowed to comprise up to 20 persons (including the couple and their two witnesses). There should be no intermingling or mixing between groups nor between the “wedding party” and these other groups. f. There must not be any reception with food and drinks, or wedding celebrations that are not essential religious rites. g. ROs must also comply with prevailing safe management measures stipulated on the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI)’s website10. Although solemnizations at places of worship11 may continue to involve live instrumental music (non-wind/brass) with the necessary safe management measures in place (see Annex C), we strongly encourage this to be suspended or the duration be shortened during this period of heightened alert. Persons involved in/supporting the live instrumental music segment should be kept to the minimum. No other performances (e.g. singing, dance, variety act) are allowed. ROs are strongly encouraged to continue offering video link solemnizations as an option for couples. Funerals From 16 May 2021, funerals, wakes, installation of niches and post-funeral rites12 at places of worship can involve not more than 20 attendees (decrease from 30 today) at any one time, including the day of burial/cremation, and in groups of no more than 2 persons (excluding religious and supporting workers, whose numbers should be kept to a minimum), subject to safe management measures and the safe capacity of the premises. a. There must not be any reception with food and drinks. b. ROs must also comply with prevailing safe management measures listed on MTI’s website13. Funerary-related activities at places of worship14 may continue to involve live instrumental music (non-wind/brass) with the necessary safe management measures in place (see Annex C). Persons involved in/supporting the live instrumental music segment should be kept to the minimum. No other performances (e.g. singing, dance, variety act) are allowed. Visits to columbaria at places of worship should be kept as short as possible, with no mingling between groups of no more than 2 persons (decrease from 5 persons today). Other Religious Activities From 16 May 2021, ROs may continue to use places of worship to conduct religious rites, in groups of no more than 2 persons (decrease from 5 persons today) and maintain safe distancing. Religious and supporting workers involved in the conduct of these rites should be kept to a minimum. All other religious activities (e.g. religious classes for adults and children) will be suspended. Given the current need to minimise the risk of COVID-19 transmission, ROs are strongly encouraged to conduct these activities via remote means or defer them until the COVID-19 situation improves. Recording and Broadcast of Religious Services and Prayers ROs are encouraged to continue supporting the religious needs of their communities via remote means such as recording and broadcast of religious services and prayers. From 16 May 2021, ROs can have up to 15 persons on-location for these productions, of which up to 10 persons can be unmasked at any one time, with no more than 2 persons unmasked for singing and/or playing wind/brass instruments. Those singing and/or playing wind/brass instruments must maintain 2 metres between all other individuals. All other persons present must maintain a 1-metre separation. The time spent on-location for this activity should be kept as short as possible. The production team must also put in place safe management measures, including no-cross deployment between locations, and thorough cleaning of technical equipment. There shall be no audience. ROs who wish to use their premises for digital recording or broadcast are required to notify through the CPRO website of (i) the planned dates of the digital productions; (ii) venue; and (iii) confirmation of adherence to the performers and crew limits, before conducting the digital productions. Safe capacity in the place of worship All the permitted religious activities in paragraphs 9 to 19 (i.e. excluding congregational and other worship services) can continue to take place concurrently, subject to safe management measures, and stipulated capacity limits for these activities – and only if these activities can be conducted safely at separate locations within the place of worship, with no interaction between worshippers while entering, exiting or while in the premises. ROs are strongly encouraged to support the religious needs of their communities through remote means, as far as possible, in line with national guidelines to reduce social interactions, and thus minimise risk of COVID-19 transmission. a. ROs should consider reducing other concurrent activities when congregational and other worship services are ongoing, so that there is a smaller total number of people on the premises at any one time, which will help to minimise the risk of large clusters from forming. Deployment of manpower ROs should primarily engage their religious workers and staff to support the permitted religious activities but can deploy volunteers to support if necessary. The number of personnel involved in conducting each permitted activity should be kept to a minimum. From 16 May 2021, telecommuting will be the default for workplaces, so as to minimise the number of on-site religious workers and staff. The religious workers and administrative staff should comply with prevailing workplace safe management measures stipulated by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM).15 Restrictions against cross-deployment16 across worksites remain in place. TraceTogether and SafeEntry TraceTogether-only SafeEntry, where the TraceTogether App or Token is required for SafeEntry check-ins, will be required at all venues that are required to implement SafeEntry from 17 May 202117. ROs must make the necessary preparations to accept check-ins by the TraceTogether App or Token. ROs can refer to www.safeentry.gov.sg for FAQs, or more information on how to set up TraceTogether-only SafeEntry for their premises. SafeEntry Gateway (SEGW) will be progressively introduced as an additional mode of SafeEntry check-in to provide quicker and more seamless check-in using the TraceTogether App or Token. Existing modes of SafeEntry check-in will remain in place. Since 19 Apr 2021, ROs conducting congregational and other worship services for more than 100 persons have been required to deploy the SafeEntry Gateway at their main entrances as an additional check-in mode. ROs conducting congregational and other worship services for 100 persons or less will also be required to deploy the SEGW at their main entrances by 15 June 2021. ROs may deploy either the physical SEGW Box or use the SEGW function found in the latest version of the SafeEntry (Business) App based on their needs. [Refer to for more information.]. Mandatory submission of Safe Management Plans ROs must acknowledge through the CPRO website the new conditions for religious activities imposed from 16 May through 13 June 2021 before commencing the activities. ROs that have not submitted their Safe Management Plans (SMPs) previously for Phase 3 will need to submit their plans, at least 2 days before commencing any activities outlined above. The detailed requirements and format for submitting these SMPs can be found at www.cpro.gov.sg. MCCY reserves the right to suspend a RO’s activities if there are gaps in the SMP submitted and until the necessary rectifications are made. ROs are responsible for the implementation of safe management measures and action could be taken for lapses and breaches. Should there be any confirmed COVID-19 cases linked to a RO’s premises or place of worship, the premises may be closed for a period of time as determined by the authorities. Working together to make Singapore COVID-safe The tightening of measures for religious activities reflect the seriousness of the current COVID-19 situation. We will have to remain vigilant and regularly refine our safe management measures in order to minimise the risk of COVID-19 transmission. MCCY will continue to work with our ROs to ensure a COVID-19 safe environment for religious activities.

       " {'text': '1 Issued: 14 May 2021 Updated: 18 May 2021 Issued: 14 May 2021 Updated: 18 May 2021 FURTHER STRICTER SAFE MANAGEMENT MEASURES FOR SPORT AND PHYSICAL EXERCISE & ACTIVITY (16 May to 13 June 2021) 1. On 14 May 2021, the Multi-Ministry Taskforce announced that with effect from 16 May to 13 June 2021, there will be further tightening of safe management measures to curb the transmission of COVID-19 within the community. To reduce risks of community transmission, indoor “mask-off” activities will cease during this period. The current permissible group size of up to 5 persons will also be reduced to no more than 2 persons. 2. Following that announcement, Sport Singapore is providing an updated guidance on the stricter set of measures that concerns all sports, physical exercises & activities, and public & private sports & recreational facilities in Singapore for the period of 16 May to 13 June 2021. These measures are directed towards reducing or containing community spread of COVID-19 by stopping sport and physical activities that take place in high-risk environments. In general, high-risk environments are enclosed, indoor spaces (fully enclosed on all sides), where participants are likely to engage in strenuous activities unmasked. As a result, no strenuous physical activities should take place in any indoor spaces regardless of size (including Indoor Sports Halls and atriums in shopping malls). There are also further restrictions on density and group size as well as outdoor and indoor exercise classes. 3. The updated measures described in this guidance have to be adhered to starting 16 May 2021 and ending at the end of 13 June 2021 and supersedes the guidance issued on 7 May 2021. Additionally, this guidance has been updated on 18 May 2021 to include paragraph 3A & 3B on the measures introduced to safeguard the well-being of children and youths 1 . SUSPENSION OF SPORT / PHYSICAL ACTIVITY CLASSES / PROGRAMMES FOR 18 YEARS & BELOW, FROM 19 MAY 3A. Aligning to the Ministry of Education’s announcements on 16 and 18 May 2021 to reduce the intermingling of students from different schools and enhance the safety of students, all indoor sport / physical activity classes / programmes regardless of class size that cater to individuals who are 18 years (born in 2003) and below, are to be suspended or moved online. This takes effect from 19 May to 13 June 2021 or till further notice. 3B. Outdoor sport / physical activity for this age group1 shall be restricted to only 1 coach to 1 student/trainee.

Multiple groups of 2 remain allowable up to 30 participants or the capacity limit of the venue, whichever is lower. The groups of 2 are not to intermingle before, during and after the class, and must remain 3 metres apart. Refer to subsequent paragraphs on restricting all indoor activities to low intensity activities with masks on at all times. ii. For organised programmes and classes that take place outdoors, an additional service provider (such as an instructor or a coach) from a permitted enterprise may guide the group. Multiple groups of 2 remain allowable up to 30 participants or the capacity limit of the venue, whichever is lower, if the activity is of low intensity with masks on at all times. The groups of 2 are not to intermingle before, during, and after the class, and must remain 3 metres apart. If the activity is of high intensity where masks have to be removed, including for swimming, only two persons are allowed (including instructor or coach) and there can be no multiple groups of 2. iii. Physical activity of a social nature should be kept to 2 participants. c. Large complexes or multi-function premises such as country clubs may treat different parts of their premises as separate facilities, provided that they are well separated by physical barriers such that intermingling is not possible. LOW INTENSITY SPORT & PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES IN INDOOR ENVIRONMENTS 5. Physical activities, sport and exercise environments that are indoors 4 , where participants are in close contact, exerting and are not reasonably expected to be wearing masks, will not be allowed. a. All indoor facilities may only allow low intensity sport and physical activities with masks on at all times. Indoor high risk environments, i.e. indoor public and private gyms and fitness/exercise/dance studios5 , including those operated by 2 The Gross Floor Area includes exercises spaces, as well as other spaces such as changing rooms, rest areas within the facility. Facilities up to 32 sqm can admit up to 2 persons; this does not include staff. 3 A 2-metre physical distancing between individuals should be maintained while exercising and playing sport. If there is more than one group sharing a space, the groups must not interact and must maintain a distance of 3 metres apart from one another at all times. 4 Defined as premises which are fully enclosed on all sides. 5 Premises identified as high-risk physical activities, sport and exercise environments include, but are not limited to, indoor fitness training facilities, indoor gyms, as well as fitness studios and similar indoor studio settings for climb walls, trampoline, dance, barre, spin, etc. Such indoor premises (and including any other type of indoor premises such as hotel, club or condominium function rooms) must not be allowed to be used, or hired out to others for use for any high intensity sport and physical activities where participants are in close contact, exerting and not wearing masks during the stipulated period. 3 Issued: 14 May 2021 Updated: 18 May 2021 commercial enterprises, country clubs, golf clubs, private apartments, condominiums and charities, are to close during the stipulated period, unless they only offer low intensity physical activities, sport and exercises where all participants and instructors are wearing masks at all times b. No such facility will be allowed to offer weight, strength or resistance training of any form, and/or provide equipment for such training, as these are associated with strenuous activities. c. Participants, instructors and staff of these facilities also have to adhere to a more stringent set of safe management measures (SMMs) per Annex. d. Premises may be used by a coach/instructor for the purposes of producing digital content for online classes. Sport Singapore will have to be notified beforehand at Sport_Covid@sport.gov.sg to confirm adherence to prevailing SMMs for digital content production. There shall be no other activities at the premises when digital content production is taking place. 6. For a list of affected Sport Singapore’s indoor facilities and programmes during this period, please visit Refunds for affected bookings that fall under these dates will be processed within the next seven working days. LARGE GROUP OUTDOOR CLASSES 7. Approved large outdoor classes at public spaces such as parks and HDB common areas, can continue, subject to the venue size and safe distancing requirements as stated in paragraph 4(b)ii. All instructors must also be registered with Sport Singapore.6 8. Sport Singapore is looking into the provision of more outdoor spaces within its ActiveSG facilities for coaches and instructors to conduct their classes. The mechanism to apply for these spaces will be announced to the community when ready. OTHER SAFE MANAGEMENT MEASURES 9. Other safe management measures will continue to be in place. These include, but are not limited to: a. Mask wearing. Masks should be worn as a default. If an individual is engaged in an outdoor activity of high intensity by himself or with another person (i.e. no more than 2 in the group), masks may be removed for the activity. Maintain social distancing from other groups. Those performing permitted low intensity sport and physical activity in an indoor environment are required to wear a mask at all times. The activity has to cease immediately, if any participant removes his or her mask, even for a short while to breathe. 6 Instructors who are interested to conduct large outdoor classes at outdoor public spaces must be registered and can do so via Subsequent approval from facility owner need to be sought before activities can be conducted. 4 Issued: 14 May 2021 Updated: 18 May 2021 b. Sharing of common equipment should be avoided. Participants in an indoor environment should not share sport and exercise equipment, such as exercise machines, bars, free weights, stationary bikes, treadmills, exercise mats where fomite transmission risk is high. No premises that remain open is to provide such equipment for use. c. Reducing Physical Interaction & Hygiene and Ensuring Safe Distancing. Owners or operators of facilities are responsible for ensuring safe management measures are implemented, and that their patrons/users comply. Facility owners/operators will have to: i. Organise human traffic flow and space management to ensure that the mixing of groups is minimised to transient contact; ii. Put in place measures to minimise crowding or mixing at common facilities e.g. toilets. Where possible, specific common facilities should be designated to specific zones so that attendees from different zones do not mix when using such facilities; iii. Conduct temperature screening7 and checks on visible symptoms8 for visitors, and turn away those with fever and/or who appear unwell. SafeEntry must be implemented for participants and visitors. From 17 May 2021 onwards, all participants and staff are to use either the TraceTogether app or the TraceTogether Tokens for SafeEntry; iv. Frequently disinfect common spaces and interactive components (e.g. smart kiosks, turnstiles). Operators are strongly encouraged to adopt good sanitation and hygiene practices to achieve the SG Clean quality mark; v. Place hand sanitisers in close proximity of the facility entrance and high-touch surfaces like door handles. Attendees should be encouraged to sanitise their hands before entering and upon leaving the facility; vi. Ensure that participants do not shout while engaging in physical activities. This is because shouting increases the risk of transmission via droplets. Coaches/instructors may raise their volume when communicating instructions or in the event of a potential danger. SPORT EVENTS FROM 8 MAY TO 13 JUNE 2021 10. As part of ongoing efforts to reduce the community spread, Sport Singapore will maintain the tightening on sport events during the stipulated period: a. Mass participation sport events will not be permitted to take place. Organisers are to work with Sport Singapore to cancel or postpone the events to a later date. b. All other sport events, including live spectator sport events, sport competitions and tournaments, will be subject to approval before they can proceed. There will be no spectators allowed at sport events and competitions. National Sports Associations 7 Individuals with temperatures 38 degrees celsius and above are considered as having a fever. 8 Notable visible symptoms to look out for include: (a) coughing; (b) sneezing; (c) breathlessness; and (d) a runny nose. 5 Issued: 14 May 2021 Updated: 18 May 2021 that are organising competitions and tournaments related to qualifications for international competitions for national athletes, should approach Sport Singapore early to discuss their plans. The above applies to all sport events, including those that have previously been endorsed by Sport Singapore. ENFORCEMENT 11. Government agencies will be conducting inspections. Enforcement action(s) under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act and the Infectious Diseases Act will be taken against businesses or individuals who fail to comply with safe management measures. EVERYONE HAS A PART TO PLAY AGAINST COVID-19 12. Singaporeans are urged to remain vigilant and observe safe distancing measures in place to minimise community transmissions. We all have a part to play in keeping COVID-19 at bay, and protect ourselves and our loved ones. 13.

An MCST can hold a physical AGM with no more than 50 persons attending the meeting in person together, or such number of persons who can be accommodated at the venue where there is at least one metre safe distancing between any two individuals, whichever is lower. MCSTs conducting physical AGMs must comply with the relevant Safe Management Measures (SMMs) as laid out in the circular and guidance notes, dated 7 April 2021, issued by BCA ( Depending on the venue size, the attendance cap could be lower than 50 persons in order to comply with the SMMs. For AGMs expecting to have an attendance that exceeds 50 persons or the number of persons that can be accommodated at the venue in compliance with the SMMs, MCSTs are advised to conduct the meetings by electronic means. Attendees must maintain at least 1 metre safe distancing between other attendees at all times during the AGM. Attendees must wear masks at all times during the AGM. Attendees must minimise socialising among one another at all times during the AGM. Socialising before or after the AGM should also be discouraged. Q6. If MCST expects an attendance of more than 50 persons, can MCST conduct the AGM via both electronic means and physical meeting? A6. For AGMs expecting to have an attendance that exceeds 50 persons or the number of persons that can be accommodated at the venue in compliance with the safe management measures, MCSTs are advised to conduct the meetings by electronic means. Please refer to A4. MCST should take note of the real risk that more than 50 attendees will turn up at the physical location. When such situation arises, the MCST will be faced with the quandary of allowing more than 50 attendees in the meeting and breaching the 50 pax cap in the Control Order. The MCST may also find it difficult to handle a crowd larger than it had anticipated, and may have difficulties adhering to the safe management measures (such as at least 1 metre distancing between 2 individuals, due to the area of the meeting location). Further, if the MCST has to turn away attendees, the MCST may breach the rights of the attendees, who are subsidiary proprietors (“SPs”), to participate in the meeting. This will expose the MCST to possible challenges by the SPs that the proceedings of the general meeting are not proper or that the SPs are denied the right to vote at the meeting. Q7. Besides AGM, can an MCST or management Council hold any other types of meetings in person?3 A7. The MCST can hold physical extraordinary general meetings, with no more than 50 persons attending the meeting in person, or such number of persons who can be accommodated at the venue where there is at least one metre safe distancing between any two individuals, whichever is lower. This arrangement can also apply to physical council meetings held by management councils. MCSTs and management councils conducting physical meetings must comply with the relevant Safe Management Measures (SMMs), including SMMs in the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations. For more information, you may wish to refer to the circular and guidance notes, dated 7 April 2021, issued by BCA ( For meetings expecting to have an attendance that exceeds 50 persons or the number of persons that can be accommodated at the venue in compliance with the SMMs, MCSTs are advised to conduct the meetings by electronic means. Safe Management Measures [For the Period of 16 May to 13 June 2021 – both dates inclusive] Q8. Can MCST continue to allow indoor sports facilities to be opened? A8. All indoor gymnasiums and indoor fitness studios are to be closed till 13 June 2021, unless low intensity physical activities, sports and exercises are conducted , where all participants and instructors are wearing masks at all times, and where there is no sharing of any common equipment. These are activities that can be done with mask on at all times such as Yoga, Pilates, stretching exercises, Tai Chi, etc. There may have to be some modification to how it is done, e.g. without the use of equipment, during this period of time. Participants, instructors and staff also have to adhere to a more stringent set of safe management measures (SMMs). No facilities will be allowed to offer weight, strength or resistance training of any form, and/or provide equipment for such training, as these are associated with strenuous activities. Other indoor facilities similar to gym and studio settings that remain in operation are to modify their activities to be in line with the more stringent SMM. For indoor sports facilities such as sports hall, swimming pool and squash court are to be closed till 13 June 2021, unless low intensity physical activities, sports and exercises are conducted , where all participants and instructors are wearing masks at all times, and where there is no sharing of any common equipment. For other indoor sports such as basketball, badminton, table tennis and volleyball playing indoors, these activities have to be changed to low intensity with masks on in a group of no more than 2 persons (i.e. 1v1). While practice drills may still be possible, competitive sports will typically be high intensity and if allowed to proceed would put participants at risk of flouting the law. Therefore, we advise MCSTs to ensure that competitive sports do not take place and masks are worn at all times. MCSTs need to ensure that the residents using these facilities observe and comply with the safe management measures (SMMs) as laid out in the circular and guidance notes, dated 4 14 May 2021, issued by Sports SG. MCSTs can refer to the latest SMM advisory issued by Sports SG at Q9. How should the MCST compute the maximum number of persons who can use a sports facility at any one time? A9 Sports facilities (e.g. hard courts, swimming pools) should have capacity limits to avoid crowdedness and minimise the risk of large clusters forming. Refer to table below. Q10. The development has 3 separate swimming pools. Can the MCST aggregate or add up the areas of the 3 swimming pools to compute the maximum number of persons who can use the swimming pools? A10. No. The maximum number of persons who can use each swimming pool shall be computed from the usable area of each individual swimming pool. Q11. How is the usable area defined for a) swimming pool, b) other water-based facilities, c) other associated features (e.g. sauna), and d) hard courts? A11. For a) swimming pool and b) other water-based facilities, the usable area of the facility refers to its Plan Area and cut-off at the edge of the drain/edge of the wall of the facility, whichever is smaller. For c) other associated features, the usable area refers to the Plan Area of the facility, excluding shower/washing facilities like changing/shower room. For d) hard courts, the usable area of the facility refers to its Plan Area and cuts off at the fence/wall of the facility. Q12. The swimming pool is not of regular shape. How does the MCST determine the area? Usable Area of the Facility Maximum Capacity More than 50 square metres Should be limited to 1 person per 16 square metres of usable area or 50 persons, whichever is lower. Each group should be 3 metres apart and each person in the group should be 2 metres apart Smaller than 50 square metres Should be limited to 2 persons.5 A12. The MCST can refer to the building plan of the development for the Plan Area of the swimming pool. Alternatively, the MCST can draw the best possible approximation of a regular shape within the outline of the pool to facilitate calculation. In the example below, the dotted rectangle can be used to calculate the area of the pool (indicated in blue outline). Example Q13. The common swimming pool is linked or connected to the private pool of each housing unit (e.g. for units on the ground floor). When the MCST computes the maximum number of persons who can use the common swimming pool, should the area of the private pools be included? A13. No. The MCST should not include the area of the private pools as part of the area of the common pool to compute the maximum number of persons who can use the common swimming pool. Q14. Can individuals from different households use a facility together? A14. Individuals from different households can use a facility together. In general, the individuals should maintain a safe distance of at least 1 metre when using any facility. If a 1 metre safe distancing between individuals is not feasible or practical, it can be applied between groups of up to 2 persons, but there should be no mixing or interaction between groups which are using the same facility. Please see the illustration below. If the activities involve exercising or playing of sports, then a longer safe distance of 2~3 metres should be maintained. Q15. What are the common facilities that should be closed? >1m >1m6 A15. All outdoor barbeque pits must be closed till 13 June 2021. Q16. If the development has a large function room or event facility, can the MCST allow more than 2 persons to use the room/facility? A16. Any gathering conducted in the function rooms or event facilities, except for the holding of solemnisations, receptions, wakes/funerals, and post-funeral religious rites, shall be kept to a maximum of 2 persons, regardless of the size of the room. Q17. What are the requirements for holding solemnisations, receptions, and wakes/funerals in the common property within condominiums? A17. For marriage solemnisations, Marriage solemnisations may continue for up to 100 participants with pre-event testing (PET) and 50 participants without PET* under “Marriage Solemnisations and Receptions” at and FAQs at for further information. No wedding reception is allowed till 13 June 2021. For wakes and funerals, up to 20 persons (excluding funeral workers and vendors) will be allowed at any one time on all days. MCSTs can refer to the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations 2020 and the NEA’s guidelines ( for the full list of SMMs applicable. The number of attendees for the events is subject to the individual venue’s capacity limit based on safe management principles. MCSTs may also set additional conditions for the use of their facilities, such as a lower limit for attendance based on their capacity or ability to ensure that SMMs are implemented. Q18. What are the requirements for holding post-funeral religious rites in the common property within condominiums? A18. The number of attendees at the event should generally be kept to 20 persons or fewer at any time. This excludes any religious workers, which should be kept to a minimum. MCSTs can refer to the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations 2020 for the full list of SMMs applicable. Q19. Can MCSTs choose not to allow the holding of solemnisations, receptions, wakes/funerals or post-funeral religious rites in the common property within condominiums?7 A19. MCSTs have a duty to control, manage and administer the common property for the benefit of all subsidiary proprietors in the development, in accordance with the applicable by-laws (including prescribed by-law 18(2) in the Second Schedule to the Building Maintenance (Strata Management) Regulations). Therefore, MCSTs should assess and determine their capacity and ability to put in place the necessary SMMs for the respective event/activity, and may set additional conditions for the use of their premises. Otherwise, MCSTs can choose to disallow these events/activities within the development. As a good practice, MCSTs are encouraged to inform residents, for instance, through a circular or notice, should MCSTs decide to disallow these events/activities. Q20. Do MCST and security guards have the power to enforce if residents report non-compliances to safe distancing measures or safe management measures? A20. MCST and security guards should step up patrol of the common areas and ensure that residents observe the safe distancing measures implemented by the Government to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission. Residents can alert the security guards or MCST of any evidence of non-compliances to social distancing measures. Where necessary, the MCST can escalate the report to BCA at with detailed information (e.g. location, date and time, and photographic evidence). Q21. Some residents are not following guidelines to maintain safe distancing or are having large gathering at common areas or at their homes, what can we do? A21. Social gatherings of 2 persons in each group outside their homes are allowed under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations 2020 to combat the coronavirus outbreak. Further, each household may only receive up to 2 unique visitors per day. Failure to comply with all relevant requirements is an offence, and BCA will not hesitate to take enforcement action against errant parties. Any non-compliance to the safe management measures should be reported to your MCST or Managing Agents (MAs) immediately. MCSTs are expected to diligently monitor the situation within their estates, and promptly deal with any contraventions of the requirements. For recalcitrant cases, MCSTs/MAs may provide feedback to BCA ( with detailed information pertaining to any contravention of the requirements', 'id': '3868fa00-42ed-4091-ae0b-722c8a64acdf', 'score': None, 'probability': None, 'question': None, 'meta': {'category': 'advisories'}, 'embedding': None},\n",
       " {'text': 'Additional measures for community activities in light of heightened alert to manage COVID transmission, and support for the sector This document provides a summary of measures that will impact community activities under MCCY sectors during Phase Two (Heightened Alert) from 16 May through 13 June 2021. 15 May 2021 The Multi-Ministry Task Force (MTF) have announced a further tightening of measures following the recent clusters of infections and an emerging pattern of local unlinked community cases. Effective from 16 May 2021 to 13 June 2021, this tightening will impact several sectors under the purview of MCCY, as well as groups and individuals working in these sectors. However, these tighter measures are necessary for Singapore to quickly contain the situation to prevent an escalation, and to protect the safety of our community. MCCY has put together support for these sectors to assist them to make the adjustments during this period. Summary of measures for MCCY sectors The key measures that will impact MCCY sectors are as follows: Live Performances All indoor and outdoor live performances should be deferred. Live performances which have been publicised before 5 May 2021 and which are scheduled to take place from 8 May through 13 Jun 2021 may only proceed with approval from MTI. From 16 May 2021, audiences will be capped at 100 persons with pre-event testing (PET), and up to 50 persons without PET. All performers must be properly masked at all times on stage. Singing or playing of instruments that require intentional expulsion of air (e.g. wind and brass instruments) will not be permitted at all times. Digital productions and associated rehearsals Recording of digital productions and their associated rehearsals are limited to 15 performers and crew on stage and backstage at any given time. This includes a maximum of 10 unmasked performers (of which no more than two persons can sing or play wind/brass instruments). Arts and cultural organisations must notify NAC of their plans before proceeding with their digital productions and associated rehearsals. Arts and culture classes, lectures, talks and workshops All speakers, participants and instructors in arts and culture classes, lectures, talks and workshops must be properly masked at all times. Activities that cannot be conducted with masks on must be suspended. There are to be no classes in singing or wind and brass instruments, even if masked. Face shields are not permitted substitutes for proper masks. The National Arts Council has released more details on the above: Museums Arts and heritage venues such as museums can continue operations, but at a reduced capacity of 25%. Tours within museum premises may be conducted for a maximum group size of 20 persons (excluding guide), with maximum of two persons allowed in any one sub-group, with all other prevailing safe management measures in place such as social distancing. The National Heritage Board has released more details on the above: Sporting activities Capacity limits for indoor and outdoor facilities have been amended to one person per 16sqm, or 50 persons, whichever is lower. This is to ensure there is even more space between people who are exercising, to minimise risk of transmission. a) Indoor facilities In line with the measure to cease all indoor “mask-off” activities, only non-strenuous activities can continue in all indoor sports venues, and participants must be masked at all times. Activities which will result in participants lowering their masks to catch a breath will not be permitted. As previously announced, no sharing of common equipment will be permitted indoors to reduce fomite transmission. b) Outdoor facilities and activities Outdoors, individuals engaging in strenuous exercises may do so in groups of up to two persons (including any instructor), keeping 2m distance between individuals. They can be unmasked when exerting but should put on their masks thereafter. c) Indoor and Outdoor large group classes Indoor and outdoor group classes are capped at 30 persons (including the instructor) or the venue capacity cap, whichever is lower. All individuals must remain masked at all times. All instructors and participants must be masked at all times. Class participants must be in groups of no more than two, with 2m between individuals, and 3m between groups. Outdoor classes for strenuous activities which require participants to be unmasked, will be capped at two persons including the instructor. Sport Singapore (SportSG) has released more details on the above: Congregational and other worship services Congregational and other worship services will be limited to 100 persons with PET, or up to 50 persons at a time without PET. This is subject to safe management measures and the venue capacity limits of the premises. Religious workers support these services should be kept to a minimum. Worshippers can participate in worship services in groups of no more than two persons. Masks must be worn at all times by all persons including when speaking during congregational and other worship services. Face shields are not permitted substitutes for proper face masks. To reduce the risk of transmission, singing and the playing of wind/brass instruments will not be allowed. There should also be no sharing of prayer or common items. Other religious activities Religious Organisations (ROs) may continue to use places of worship to conduct religious rites, in groups of no more than two persons. All other religious activities (e.g. religious classes for adults and children) will be suspended. Digital productions and associated rehearsals Recording of digital productions at the place of worship are limited to 15 performers and crew on stage and backstage at any given time. This includes a maximum of 10 unmasked performers (of which no more than two persons can sing or play wind/brass instruments). ROs must notify MCCY of their plans before proceeding with their digital productions. Wedding solemnisations and Funeral rites Wedding solemnisations may continue, with up to 100 persons with PET, or up to 50 persons without PET, subject to venue capacity limits. The cap of 100 and 50 persons respectively, exclude the solemnizer and religious and supporting workers, whose numbers should be kept to a minimum. In line with curbs on dine-in F&B establishments, wedding receptions will not be allowed. Funerals, wakes, burial/cremations, installation of niches and post-funeral rites at places of worship can involve not more than 20 attendees at any time, subject to venue capacity limits. Attendees should be organised in groups of no more than two persons. The cap of 20 excludes religious and supporting workers, whose numbers should be kept to a minimum. Attendees are to maintain safe distancing and be masked at all times to reduce the risk of transmission. More details have been released separately: Support for MCCY sectors MCCY and our agencies have been focused on providing support to groups, businesses, and individuals within our sectors to manage the disruptions resulting from COVID-19, and to help them emerge stronger. Both the Arts and Culture Resilience Package and the Sports Resilience Package have been dedicated to tide our sectors throughout the pandemic. Arts & Culture The Arts and Culture Resilience Package has been topped up over the past year to the current $75M. This funds operating grants, venue hire subsidies, assistance to SEPs and assistance to support the transformation of businesses. In addition, MCCY will provide further support for arts and culture self-employed persons (SEPs) affected by the latest tightened measures. We will also subsidise the costs of PET for arts and culture companies presenting permitted live performances from 16 May – 13 June 2021. This will enable larger audiences to attend live performances in this period safely, cushioning the financial impact to arts companies caused by these tightened measures. NAC will release more information on how SEPs and groups presenting live performances can apply for the additional support. Sports SportSG recently announced relief measures for businesses and SEPs affected by the measures announced on 8 May for the period up to 30 May 2021. This includes project grants, operating grants, training assistance grants, and direct cash assistance. This will continue to be available, to help affected businesses defray the costs of overheads. We will extend the support to cover the heightened alert period up to 13 June 2021. SportSG is looking into the provision of more outdoor spaces within its ActiveSG facilities for coaches and instructors to conduct their classes. The mechanism to apply for these spaces will be announced to the community when ready. Details will be communicated by the respective agencies when ready. Keeping our community safe It is critical that our people, businesses, and government work together to bring down the number of COVID-19 cases, to keep our community safe. MCCY understands that the tightened measures are disruptive to our sectors and have developed support packages to help our stakeholders make the necessary adjustments. MCCY very much appreciates our religious organisations, as well as our arts, culture, and sports businesses and communities for rallying together to implement the safe management measures. Together, we will emerge safe, and stronger.

       " {'text': 'Advisory to dormitory operators - Additional measures in line with Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) Issued on 17 May 2021 Additional Measures in line with Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) To better protect our migrant workers (MWs) living in dormitories from being exposed to COVID-19 in the community, the Ministry of Manpower will implement additional measures for them from 17 May 2021. These measures are in response to the community measures introduced on 14 May for Phase 2 (Heightened Alert). It is important that dormitory operators continue to ensure good Safe Living Measures (SLM) are practised in the dormitories. Suspension of Safe Rest Day Visits to Recreation Centres Visits to the Recreation Centres for Safe Rest Days will be suspended temporarily until further notice. We are currently exploring arrangements to allow visits to Recreation Centres in a safe and controlled manner during this Phase of heightened alert and will update in due course. This measure is to mitigate the risk of them being exposed to possible infection and subsequently infecting others in their dormitories. MWs will still be allowed to carry out essential errands, including reporting sick if they are unwell. MWs who are found to have acted irresponsibly may face further actions such as having their work passes revoked. Use of Communal Dormitory Facilities In line with the national measures during this period, all the gyms, beer gardens and communal dining facilities within the dormitories will need to be closed, and canteens can only offer takeaway services (i.e. no dining in). MOM will step up enforcement on the compliance to Safe Management Measures during this period. Ensure that all activities within your dormitories are to be capped at the permissible group size of up to two persons. You should remind your residents to continue to adhere to the appropriate Safe Management Measures within your dormitories. No Change to Work, RRT and Vaccination Appointments There will be no changes to the work arrangements for your residents. They will be able to continue to go to work if they have a green AccessCode. Employers have been reminded to continue to arrange dedicated transport arrangements for your residents, at staggered pick-up and drop-off timings to and from the worksites. Your residents will also be allowed to leave their dormitories to attend their Rostered Routine Testing (RRT) and vaccination appointments. Dormitory operators are required to ensure that your residents adhere to their assigned groupings, to restrict intermixing. Responsibilities as dormitory operators Ensure that Safe Living Measures are enforced and adhered to, including, but not limited to the following measures: Good layer segregation with residential floors or layers, to restrict intermixing. Consistent cleaning and disinfection of high-touch surfaces and communal areas. Staggered pick-up and drop off timings, especially during peak hours. Remind your residents not to go to work if they feel unwell and seek medical care. Inform your residents to comply with the Infection Prevention Control (IPC) Measures, including: DosDon’ts Wear a mask correctly, covering nose and mouth at all times. Maintain good personal hygiene, including washing their hands with soap and water frequently. Use hand sanitizers after coming into contact with high touch areas, such as ATMs. Maintain 1 metre safe distance. Seek medical help if they are feeling unwell, via telemedicine on FWMOMCareApp. Inform the dormitory operator or employer to provide a dedicated transport to the regional medical centre. For emergencies, call 995. Do not intermix with other MWs working in different zones at your worksite or residing in other floors or layers in the dormitories. Do not go to work when unwell. Employers are responsible for the upkeep and maintenance of your residents’ well-being. You should continue to work with employers and make the necessary arrangements to ensure that your residents are given proper food during this period. Dorms with mini-mart operations should prepare to support MWs by ensuring sufficient stock of daily essentials during this period. Mini-marts should not take advantage and increase prices. If your residents need access to physical remittance services, inform the Forward Assurance and Support Team (FAST) so that they can assess how best to facilitate this for your residents.

       " {'text': 'Advisory to employers - Additional measures in line with Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) Issued on 17 May 2021 Additional Measures in line with Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) To better protect our migrant workers (MWs) living in dormitories from being exposed to COVID-19 in the community, the Ministry of Manpower will implement additional measures for them from 17 May 2021. These measures are in response to the community measures introduced on 14 May for Phase 2 (Heightened Alert). Suspension of Safe Rest Day Visits to Recreation Centres Visits to the Recreation Centres for Safe Rest Days will be suspended temporarily until further notice. We are currently exploring arrangements to allow visits to Recreation Centres in a safe and controlled manner during this Phase of heightened alert and will update in due course. This measure is to mitigate the risk of them being exposed to possible infection and subsequently infecting others in their dormitories. MWs will still be allowed to carry out essential errands, including reporting sick if they are unwell. MWs who are found to have acted irresponsibly may face further actions such as having their work passes revoked. Use of Communal Dormitory Facilities In line with the national measures during this period, all the gyms, beer gardens and communal dining facilities within the dormitories will need to be closed, and canteens can only offer takeaway services (i.e. no dining in). MOM will step up enforcement on the compliance to Safe Management Measures during this period. All activities within the dormitories are to be capped at the permissible group size of up to two persons. You should remind your MWs to continue to adhere to the appropriate Safe Management Measures within their dormitories. No Change to Work, RRT and Vaccination Appointments There will be no changes to the work arrangements for your MWs. They will be able to continue to go to work if they have a green AccessCode. Employers are reminded to continue to arrange dedicated transport arrangements for your MWs, at staggered pick-up and drop-off timings to and from the worksites. Please continue to ensure proper Safe Management Measures at your worksites to minimise inter-mixing. Your MWs will also be allowed to leave their dormitories to attend their Rostered Routine Testing (RRT) and vaccination appointments. Employers are required to arrange dedicated transport arrangements for your MWs and ensure that your MWs adhere to their assigned groupings, to restrict intermixing. Responsibilities as employers Food and salary. Employers are responsible for the upkeep and maintenance of your MWs’ well-being. Please continue to make the necessary arrangements to ensure that your MWs are paid and given proper food during this period. Please note that your MWs should still receive their salary if they are placed on movement restriction or quarantine. Infection, Prevention, and Control Measures. Remind your MWs not to go to work if they feel unwell and seek medical care. Please inform your MWs to comply with the Safe Living and Infection Prevention Control (IPC) Measures, including: DosDon’ts Wear a mask correctly, covering nose and mouth at all times. Maintain good personal hygiene, including washing their hands with soap and water frequently. Use hand sanitizers after coming into contact with high touch areas, such as ATMs. Maintain 1 metre safe distance. Seek medical help if they are feeling unwell, via telemedicine on FWMOMCareApp. Inform the dormitory operator or employer to provide a dedicated transport to the regional medical centre. For emergencies, call 995. Do not intermix with other MWs working in different zones at your worksite or residing in other floors or layers in the dormitories. Do not go to work when unwell. As this may be a difficult period for your MWs, we encourage that you continue to engage them to provide them with emotional and mental support. During this period, we will also be disseminating care packs, including masks and hand sanitisers to them. You may refer to Annex A for more information on the support you can provide to your MWs.

Approval must be sought from ESG. 8 These play areas refer to the facilities provided free-of-charge in the shops or at the malls’ common areas. 9 More information on SafeEntry and a full list of places where SafeEntry must be deployed can be found at 10 However, all retail establishments and lifestyle-related services must require their employees to do SafeEntry check-in. They must transit to TraceTogether-only SafeEntry when this is implemented from 17 May 2021.Page 4 of 16 8.3.2. From 17 May 2021, TraceTogether-only SafeEntry will be implemented at the above establishments. Refer to Annex A for details on the SafeEntry implementation. 8.3.3. From 15 June 2021, retail establishments required to deploy SafeEntry for customers and visitors will need to provide the SafeEntry Gateway11 (SEGW) as an option for SafeEntry check-in. SEGW is available as a feature within the SafeEntry (Business) App (updated to version 1.1.0 and above) and as a physical standalone device (SEGW Box). These establishments may apply for a free SEGW Box12 . 8.4. Health checks 8.4.1. All malls, large standalone stores, supermarkets and stores providing personal care and beauty services must conduct temperature screening13 , employees must check for visible symptoms14 for customers at entrances, and turn away those with fever and/or who appear unwell15 . 8.5.

Retail establishments should put up clear signages to remind customers to comply with safe management requirements where applicable, and train and deploy service personnel to provide clear communication to customers on SMMs. 10. Refer to Annex B for other recommended guidelines, and Annex C on guidance for specific trades. 11 The SEGW enables contactless detection of both the TraceTogether App and Token, and serves as an additional means of SafeEntry check-in that is quicker and more seamless. It also allows users to check if their Token has run out of battery or is not working. 12 Refer to go.gov.sg/gateway-overview for how to implement the SEGW and apply for a free SEGW Box. 13 Individuals with temperatures above 38 degrees Celsius are considered as having a fever. Supermarkets and stores providing beauty services in malls need not conduct temperature screening and checks on visible symptoms for customers if the mall is already doing so. They should, however, do so if they operate outside the mall hours. 14 Notable visible symptoms to look out for include: (a) coughing; (b) sneezing; (c) breathlessness; and (d) a runny nose. 15 Except where the individual is entering the permitted premises to seek medical treatment for a specific symptom.Page 5 of 16 Safe Management Measures – Workplace premises16 11. To ensure COVID-safe workplaces, retail establishments should take care of their workers, workplaces and those who may become unwell at their workplaces, as outlined in MOM’s Requirements for Safe Management Measures at the Workplace. Enforcement of measures 12. Government agencies will be conducting inspections to check on the proper implementation of the SMMs. Under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act passed in Parliament on 7 April 2020, first-time offenders will face a fine of up to S$10,000, imprisonment of up to six months, or both. For subsequent offences, they may face a fine of up to S$20,000, imprisonment of up to twelve months, or both. 13. Businesses that do not implement or comply with the government’s SMMs may be ineligible for government grants, loans, tax rebates and other assistance, and may also be subject to temporary closures. Annex A – Details of SafeEntry check-in and TraceTogether-only SafeEntry implementation Annex B – Other recommended guidelines for customer-facing operations Annex C – Trade-specific Safe Management Measures for Retail Establishments and Lifestyle-Related Services Issued by: Enterprise Singapore Housing & Development Board Singapore Tourism Board Urban Redevelopment Authority Updated as of 18 May 2021 _________________________________________________________________________ 16 Refers to the retail establishments’ back-of-house operations involving employees, including at offices, warehouses and manufacturing facilities.Page 6 of 16 ANNEX A Details of SafeEntry check-in and TraceTogether-only SafeEntry implementation - Before 17 May 2021, SafeEntry check-in can be done by: i) Scanning of the SafeEntry QR code using a QR code scanner on a smartphone; ii) Using the SingPass App; iii) Using the TraceTogether App; iv) Presenting the TraceTogether Token QR code or ID card to the camera/2D scanner linked to SafeEntry (Business) App for scanning; or v) Bringing the TraceTogether Token or App close to a SEGW. - From 17 May 2021, when TraceTogether-only SafeEntry is implemented at the retail establishments (as listed in paragraph 8.3.1)17, SafeEntry check-in can only be done by: i) Scanning the SafeEntry QR code using the TraceTogether App; ii) Presenting the TraceTogether Token QR code to the camera/2D scanner linked to SafeEntry (Business) App for scanning; or iii) Bringing the TraceTogether Token or App close to a SEGW. - To help ease the transition, scanning of barcodes on ID cards will be retained until 31 May 2021. Following which, ID cards can only be used under extenuating circumstances. For more information, please refer to the FAQs on www.safeentry.gov.sg. - In addition, from 15 June 2021, retail establishments required to deploy SafeEntry for customers and visitors will need to provide the SEGW as an option for SafeEntry check-in. SEGW is available as a feature within the SafeEntry (Business) App (updated to version 1.1.0 and above) and as a physical standalone device (SEGW Box). These establishments may apply for a free SEGW Box18 . - To prepare for the implementation of TraceTogether-only SafeEntry, the above retail establishments should already accept TraceTogether Tokens as a mode of SafeEntry check-in19. Businesses that accept ID cards for check-in will be able to accept Token for check-in if they are already using: i) A smartphone loaded with the SafeEntry (Business) App setup; ii) a laptop and scanner setup if the scanner can scan barcode and QR code; or iii) a SEGW App or SEGW Box. - For avoidance of doubt, TraceTogether Token check-in and SEGW both refer to the mode of check-in, while TraceTogether-only SafeEntry refers to the overall programme which will permit only TraceTogether modes of check-in (i.e. TraceTogether App or Token). - After TraceTogether-only SafeEntry is implemented from 17 May 2021: i) Large retail stores > 930 sqm (or 10,000 sqft) and supermarkets located within a TraceTogether-only SafeEntry building (e.g. malls) that have the same operating hours as the building will no longer be required to deploy SafeEntry check-in for customers, vendors and visitors. Those located within a TraceTogether-only SafeEntry building but with longer operating hours must implement TraceTogether-only SafeEntry outside the building’s operating hours. 17 All retail establishments must require their employees to do SafeEntry check-in using TraceTogether-only SafeEntry when this is implemented from 17 May 2021. 18 Refer to go.gov.sg/gateway-overview for how to implement the SEGW and apply for a free SEGW Box. 19 TraceTogether Token check-in is done by premises scanning the QR codes on the TraceTogether Tokens of customers, vendors and visitors. Refer to to find out how to implement Token check-in mode.Page 7 of 16 ii) Small retail stores (< 930 sqm or 10,000 sqft) that were not required to deploy SafeEntry for customers but have voluntarily done so, should remove their SafeEntry check-ins.Page 8 of 16 ANNEX B Other recommended guidelines for customer-facing operations A. Queue management - Queues should not cause congestion for neighbouring establishments or at other parts of the mall. B. Crowd management - Limit groups of customers entering the store to no more than 2 persons. - Do not hold activities that would attract large crowds inside and outside of the retail establishment (e.g. celebrity appearances, aggressive shopping deals, closed-door members sales). - A standard operating procedure (SOP) should be put in place to manage long queues and large crowds that could form inside or outside stores (e.g. where popular products are displayed) and/or the mall. - Encourage the use of self-checkout, and cashless or contactless payment to reduce contact between employees and customers. - Encourage customers to book appointments, for the viewing and testing of products, as well as for services (e.g. consultation, repairs). - Consider placing frequently purchased goods and necessities near the entrance or checkout to facilitate movement and reduce in-store dwell time. - Operators should take additional steps to manage the capacity within common play areas for children/toddlers/infants (e.g. deploying an employee to man the area), where practicable. C. Health checks - All retail stores not mandated to conduct temperature screening and not located within malls are encouraged to do so and check for visible symptoms where practicable. D. Cleanliness and hygiene - Limit display and testing of products, e.g. stationery, laptops, mobile phones, etc. Employees to conduct product demonstrations if required. Such products should also be sanitised regularly. - Where possible, place hand sanitisers in close proximity of store entrances, high-touch surfaces like door handles, as well as common play areas. Encourage customers to sanitise their hands before entering stores and/or handling products on display. - Supermarkets and other retail establishments which provide trolleys and baskets to their customers are encouraged to provide disinfectant wipes for customers to clean the handles of such trolleys and baskets. - Products that customers touch frequently such as clothes, footwear, jewellery, accessories and optical products, should be cleaned, sanitised or sterilised frequently, where possible. E. Encourage online retail, and “click & collect” for goods and delivery - Encourage online retail and click-and-collect from store, to reduce dwell time - Where practicable, collection and delivery from the store must be spaced out and contactless. - Take reasonable steps to ensure that delivery personnel observe at least one-metre spacing at all times and do not cluster together. Page 9 of 16 - Refer to the Advisory for Delivery Businesses for guidelines on delivery requirements. F. Use of retail establishments as a third-party venue for work-related events - If a retail outlet is used as a third-party event space, as a best practice, only one event should be held in the outlet at a time. If not feasible, each third-party event should be clearly demarcated from the others, as well as from the main consumer shopping area. Each area should be kept completely separate by either a solid partition (at least 1.8- metre high, from wall to wall), or a minimum 3-metre spacing demarcated by continuous physical barriers (e.g. plexiglass screens, barricade tape, queue poles). There should be no mixing or intermingling of guests from separate events. Page 10 of 16 ANNEX C Trade-Specific Safe Management Measures for Retail Establishments The table below contains the trade-specific Safe Management Measures recommended for the customer-facing operations of retail establishments. • Retail establishments are reminded to ensure that their employees and customers wear their masks properly at all times, except when eating or drinking. • The other measures indicated as “MUST” below are also requirements to be implemented, in addition to the measures listed in the main body of the advisory. • The remaining measures should be implemented, where practicable. Category Customer-facing operations Malls, Standalone stores • Allow tenants to extend queues beyond their premises and mark queue spots outside their units, in order to manage the crowd. However, this should not cause congestion at neighbouring stores or at other parts of the mall. • Put in place Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to identify hotspots and manage large crowds and long queues both within and outside the malls; these may include re-directing customers to other outlets, breaking the queues into several sections, putting up signs that indicate length of queuing time and implementing queue or appointment management systems20 . • Food delivery personnel entering the malls for food collection must do their SafeEntry check-in and temperature screening. Malls are encouraged to set up dedicated lanes for these food delivery personnel to enter the malls or allow them to be prioritised in other ways. This is so as to better manage the queues and mall capacity. • Malls are encouraged to designate and clearly demarcate a dining area for their own employees and mobile workers (such as taxi and private hire car drivers, food delivery personnel and SDAs) to take their meals as these individuals may not have any suitable space to do so. Malls must ensure that these individuals consume their meals alone, keep a distance of at least one metre from any other individual and refrain from interacting with anyone. They must also ensure that these individuals wear their masks immediately after eating or drinking. SafeEntry check-in must be deployed at these designated areas. 20 While implementing the necessary SMMs, malls should ensure that the entrance and exit points remain accessible to those with disabilities.Page 11 of 16 Supermarkets, Convenience stores, Mini-marts • Consider providing dedicated shopping hours for vulnerable groups, such as the elderly, persons with disabilities and pregnant women. • Limit groups of customers entering the store to no more than 2 persons. Supermarkets • Put in place Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to identify hotspots and manage large crowds and long queues both within and outside the supermarkets; these may include re-directing customers to other outlets, breaking the queues into several sections, putting up signs that indicate length of queuing time and implementing queue or appointment management systems. Books & Stationeries • Minimise browsing time by encouraging customers to read book summaries online and reduce browsing in\\x02store.

Fashion (Apparel, Shoes, Jewellery, Accessories and Optical wear) • Fitting rooms, seats and try-out areas should be spaced at least one metre apart and clearly demarcated. Fitting rooms should be disinfected after each use. • Discourage the testing and trying of products. Products tried on by customers should be sanitised where possible, e.g. via steaming, cleaning, leaving overnight to air, or other reasonable sanitisation methods. • Implement click-and-collect systems (customers can browse and purchase items online and collect them in stores) to reduce dwell time. • Encourage online purchases by having a flexible return policy. Apparel • Limit the number of apparels per fitting to minimise dwell time. • Employees conducting tailoring and measuring services should wear personal protective equipment, e.g. masks at all times.Page 12 of 16 Jewellery, Watches, Accessories • Establishments offering piercing services MUST ensure that all tools are thoroughly disinfected before and after each use. Optical Wear • Equipment used for eye checks and consultations MUST be sanitised before each new customer is served.

       " {'text': 'CEA Ref: N13-21 Date: 15 May 2021 By Email To: Key Executive Officers and Real Estate Salespersons Dear Sir / Madam, [NOTICE 13-21] UPDATED ADVISORY ON PROPERTY TRANSACTION ACTIVITIES BY ESTATE AGENTS AND REAL ESTATE SALESPERSONS UNDER PHASE 2 (HEIGHTENED ALERT) IN THE FIGHT AGAINST COVID-19 1. This notice is to update Key Executive Officers (KEOs) and Real Estate Salespersons (RESs) on the new measures to observe from 16 May 2021 through 13 June 2021 (inclusive) to minimise the risk of transmission of COVID-19. Updated advisory 2. On 14 May 2021, the Multi-Ministry Taskforce (MTF) announced that: a. The permissible group size will be further reduced from five to two persons. b. The maximum number of distinct visitors allowed per household per day will similarly be reduced from five to two persons. 3. Both restrictions take effect from 16 May 2021 and will continue until 13 June 2021 (inclusive). Individuals are also strongly encouraged to continue to limit their overall number of social gatherings to not more than two per day, whether to another household, or meeting with friends and family members in a public place. 4. The real estate agency industry must continue to play its part to reduce the spread of COVID-19. The number of locally transmitted COVID-19 cases and unlinked community cases have continued to increase, and the situation could quickly escalate if these cases are not contained swiftly and decisively. Given that the nature of estate agency work may require you to be in various enclosed spaces and in close proximity with different persons and clients, you must be extra vigilant and take all necessary precautions against the spread of COVID-19 in Singapore. 5. With the new announcement, this means that you need to ensure that no more than two distinct persons a day may visit a property inhabited by a household when you conduct estate agency work. The two distinct persons include you and any other person who is visiting the property. You will need to check that your client and the property occupant(s), if the client does not live at the property being visited, are aware of the updated rules, and the number of visitors that may visit the property per day. 6. In addition, in line with the need to act decisively to contain the risk of any spread from undetected cases in the community, you are to defer all door-to-door marketing activities, including flyer distribution to households and business premises, until further notice. 7. Estate Agents (EAs) and RESs are advised to observe this notice and attached updated Guide, which supersedes the previous Notice 10-21 dated 5 May 2021, from 16 May 2021 onwards.8. We seek your continued support and cooperation to protect the health and safety of your employees, RESs, clients and the community. Yours sincerely, KELLY NG DEPUTY DIRECTOR (POLICY & PLANNING) COUNCIL FOR ESTATE AGENCIES Annex – CEA Guide on Property Transaction Activities by EAs and RESs under Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) in the fight against COVID-19 (15 May 2021).As at 15 May 2021 Annex to CEA Notice 13-21 CEA GUIDE ON PROPERTY TRANSACTION ACTIVITIES BY ESTATE AGENTS AND REAL ESTATE SALESPERSONS UNDER PHASE 2 (HEIGHTENED ALERT) IN THE FIGHT AGAINST COVID-19 1. This Guide sets out how estate agents (EAs) and Real Estate Salespersons (RESs) can conduct your operations at your office and your property transaction activities in a safe manner to minimise the risk of transmission of COVID-19. This Guide has been updated following the new heightened measures announced by the Multi-Ministry Taskforce (MTF) on 14 May 2021. 2. In addition to this Guide, you must follow all mandatory requirements and guidance issued by other government ministries and agencies (see Appendix). GENERAL PRINCIPLES 3. The real estate agency industry has an important role to play in reducing the spread of COVID-19 in Singapore. We must remain vigilant in our fight against COVID-19. The following general principles will continue to apply to EAs and RESs: a. Fighting COVID-19 is our collective responsibility: The real estate agency industry shares the responsibility of protecting yourselves and the community you serve to minimise the risk of community transmission. All of us must continue to exercise social responsibility to prevent new cases and clusters from emerging in our industry and community. b. Safe management measures should be an integral part of property transaction activities: As you conduct your operations and property transaction activities, you should continue to adopt a cautious approach and accord priority to protect public health and safety. CORPORATE FUNCTIONS General requirements 4. You are to comply with the Ministry of Manpower’s (MOM) requirements for safe management measures at your office (click here). Work-from-home will be the default at workplaces, and you must ensure that employees who are able to work from home do so. Group or mass activities 5. You are encouraged to use information technology (IT) tools such as video or virtual conferencing platforms, in place of group or mass activities. 6. If a group or mass activity cannot be done virtually, EAs must adopt a cautious approach and reduce the number of people interacting with one another and the duration of the activity. EAs must comply with relevant safe management measures and guidelines for events and activities1 , such as limits on capacity and group sizes. 1 This includes consumer-facing events, such as property launches, roadshows and other marketing events.PROPERTY TRANSACTION ACTIVITIES Standard requirements for on-site property transaction activities 7. You should continue to use IT tools and solutions for your work as much as possible, and only meet your clients in person if it is absolutely necessary for the conduct of the property transaction. If the activity cannot be done virtually, you must take the necessary safe management precautions and record the details of all persons whom you meet. This means that: a. EAs and RESs must adopt the following precautions and ensure that all persons at the activity do the same (hereinafter referred to as “safety precautions”): i. Wear masks2 . ii. Maintain a physical distance of at least one metre between persons. iii. If a person who turns up for the activity is unwell (e.g. exhibits respiratory symptoms and/or has a fever), ask him not to participate in the activity, and to see a doctor. b. If the activity is conducted in premises where safe management measures are not in place (e.g. at a client’s place of residence) or at the transaction property (whether occupied or unoccupied), you must record the entry of your client(s) or any person accompanying you into the premises 2 Face shields should not be used as a substitute for mask wear, except for certain exceptions as permitted by MOH.(hereinafter referred to as “contact tracing requirements”). You may choose to keep the records manually or using other methods3 . c. If you are conducting viewing, handover or takeover activities, you are encouraged to take appropriate measures to reduce contact with surfaces (hereinafter referred to as \"contactless requirements”): i. Encourage all attendees to sanitise their hands. ii. Open doors and windows, and switch on lights in the property so as to minimise your clients touching these during the on-site activity. If the property is occupied, you may wish to request the occupants to do so prior to the activity. iii. Request your clients not to touch surfaces within the premises. You may wear gloves to prepare and facilitate the viewing, handover or takeover with minimum contact of the property by your clients. iv. Do not hand out materials at the meeting (e.g. marketing materials or documents relating to the handover or takeover such as end-of\\x02tenancy checklist, inventory list or property condition report). You should use electronic means to deliver such materials to your clients. 3 EAs and RESs are encouraged to adopt the use of TraceTogether via the TraceTogether token or mobile application for all your estate agency work with your clients and whenever you engage and meet other people in the course of your activities. Listing and marketing properties 8. You are encouraged to market properties using non-physical means (e.g. digital or telephone marketing). The following activities should be deferred until further notice: a. Door-to-door marketing activities (e.g. canvassing from door to door to request owners of unlisted properties if they would like to sell their property). This includes distributing flyers to households and business premises. b. Marketing of properties (including new developments) in public spaces. This includes marketing and distributing flyers at publicly accessible common spaces such as public transport nodes and HDB common areas. 9. If you lease enclosed premises in buildings zoned for retail use such as malls to conduct property transaction activities, you are to comply with the safe management measures for retail establishments that have been set out by Enterprise Singapore, Housing & Development Board (HDB), Singapore Tourism Board and Urban Redevelopment Authority. The measures that apply to all customer-facing operations of retail establishments include safe distancing, crowd management, contact tracing, health checks, cleanliness and hygiene measures. 10. EAs and RESs may enter properties to photograph or film the properties in order to conduct online viewings thereafter, subject to the consent of the seller or landlord. In addition, you must: a. Comply with the safety precautions and contact tracing requirements as stated in paragraph 7(a) and paragraph 7(b) respectively. b. If the property is inhabited by a household, check with your client and the property occupant(s), if the client does not live at the property being visited,to ensure that your visit would not exceed the cap of two distinct visitors (which includes yourself) per household per day, and that your client and the property occupant(s) are aware of this requirement for all visitors. For vacant properties, ensure that no more than two persons visit the property at any one time. Such persons include you and any professional whom you engaged to assist you with preparing the property for listing or virtual viewing (e.g. video production crew). c. Minimise the amount of time spent in the property. d. Minimise interactions with the occupants if the property is occupied. Meeting your client 11. You are encouraged to continue using IT tools in place of face-to-face interaction, such as video or virtual conferencing platforms to meet with your client. 12. If the meeting cannot be done virtually (e.g. to sign property transaction documents that require “wet-ink” signatures), you should do so in premises where safe management measures are in place, such as the EA’s office. You should reduce the number of persons attending the meeting to the minimum extent possible. 13. If you meet your client at his place of residence or at the transaction property, you must: a. Comply with the safety precautions and contact tracing requirements as stated in paragraph 7(a) and paragraph 7(b) respectively. b. If the property is inhabited by a household, check with your client and the property occupant(s), if the client does not live at the property being visited, to ensure that your visit would not exceed the cap of two distinct visitors (which includes yourself) per household per day, and that your client and the property occupant(s) are aware of this requirement for all visitors. For vacant properties, ensure that no more than two persons visit the property at any one time. Such persons include you and any other person who is visiting the property. c. Minimise the time spent with the client. Conducting viewings 14. You are encouraged to arrange for virtual viewings first before doing viewings in person to reduce the number of viewings that your client will need to decide on the property. 15. Open houses are still not allowed as these may attract large groups of people congregating at the property. 16. When conducting physical viewings, you are to: a. Comply with the safety precautions and contact tracing requirements, and are encouraged to adopt contactless measures as stated in paragraph 7(a), paragraph 7(b) and paragraph 7(c) respectively. b. Arrange for all viewings to be done on an appointment basis only, with the start and end times clearly stated and known to the attendees of the viewing. Keep viewings short and end by the scheduled end time. You must not schedule back-to-back viewings for vacant properties. There should be a time gap between appointments to prevent gatherings or physical interactions with other persons from taking place in or near the property.c. If the property is inhabited by a household, check with your client and the property occupant(s), if the client does not live at the property being visited, to ensure that your visit would not exceed the cap of two distinct visitors (which includes yourself) per household per day, and that your client and the property occupant(s) are aware of this requirement for all visitors. For vacant properties, ensure that no more than two distinct persons visit the property at any one time. Such persons include you and any other person who is visiting the property. 17. Where advisories have been issued by relevant authorities (e.g. by the Urban Redevelopment Authority) in relation to clients’ business activities, EAs and RESs should adhere to these advisories and advise their clients accordingly. Signing and delivering estate agency agreement and property transaction documents 18. You should continue to use IT tools and solutions as much as possible, and only meet your client in person if it is absolutely necessary for the conduct of the property transaction. This means that you should: a. Use electronic means to deliver and receive the documents from your client. b. Arrange for a phone, video or virtual meeting to go through and explain the clauses in the documents to your client. You must give your client sufficient time to read and understand the meaning and consequences of the provisions in the documents. c. Use electronic signatures in place of “wet-ink” signatures for signing of the estate agency agreement. d. If you meet the client at a property that is inhabited by a household, ensure that your visit would not exceed the cap of two distinct visitors (which includes yourself) per household per day. 19. Different organisations such as banks and the transacting parties may have their own policies or preferences on the use of electronic signatures. Contracting parties may consider the use of secure electronic signatures for property transactions for greater assurance, such as “Sign with SingPass”, which allows SingPass users to use the SingPass mobile application to digitally sign an electronic document. You should seek advice from appropriate professionals such as lawyers if you or your client have any doubt in relation to the use of electronic signatures for these documents. 20. Please note that HDB currently does not allow the exercise of option to be done remotely or electronically. Forms prescribed by HDB, such as its Option to Purchase form, require “wet-ink” signatures. Handing or taking over rental properties 21. You may assist to facilitate the handover or takeover of rental properties. However, you should first arrange for virtual meetings to discuss handover or takeover matters. 22. When meeting, you should keep interactions short and adhere strictly to the group size cap and/or daily visitor cap. In addition, you must comply with the safety precautions and contact tracing requirements, and are encouraged to adopt contactless measures as stated in paragraph 7(a), paragraph 7(b) and paragraph 7(c) respectively.CONCLUSION 23. Where mandatory requirements and guidance by other government ministries and agencies have been issued, you should adhere to them and advise your client accordingly. These authorities include Ministry of Health, Ministry of Manpower, Ministry of Trade and Industry, Building and Construction Authority, Enterprise Singapore, Housing & Development Board, Singapore Tourism Board, Urban Redevelopment Authority, and Singapore Land Authority. You may refer to the resource reference at the Appendix. 24. The heightened measures that are imposed from 16 May 2021 to 13 June 2021 under Phase 2 (Heightened Alert), are necessary to curb the COVID-19 infections in Singapore. We seek your continued support and cooperation to remain vigilant and adhere to the safe management measures to protect the health and safety of your employees, RESs, clients and the community.Appendix of Annex to CEA Notice 13-21 LIST OF KEY GOVERNMENT MINISTRIES AND AGENCIES WITH GUIDANCE AND ADVISORIES RELEVANT TO THE REAL ESTATE AGENCY INDUSTRY [CEA] COVID-19 [MOH] [MTI] GoBusiness sg/ [MOM] Safe management measures at the workplace d-19/requirements-for-safe\\x02management-measures [ESG, HDB, STB and URA] Safe Management Measures: Retail Establishments and lifestyle\\x02related services esg.gov.sg/covid\\x0219/safe-distance [BCA] Built Environment Sector COVID-19 Information D-19 [HDB] web/homepage [URA] orate [SLA]', 'id': 'b706e1b2-ea56-4191-bacf-c11233ecd40c', 'score': None, 'probability': None, 'question': None, 'meta': {'category': 'advisories'}, 'embedding': None},\n",
       " {'text': 'Updated guidelines for volunteer management during COVID-19 pandemic Note: This supersedes the earlier Guidelines for Volunteer Management during COVID-19 Pandemic, dated 7 May 2021. 17 May 2021 On 14 May 2021, the Multi-Ministry Taskforce (MTF) announced the need to tighten the measures introduced on 8 May 2021 to decisively arrest the increasing number of cases in the community. These measures will take effect from 16 May to 13 June 20211. This document provides guidance to individuals and organisations on their volunteering activities in Phase Two (Heightened Alert). Approach for Phase Two (Heightened Alert) Volunteers continue to play a key role in the fight against COVID-19. Their activities include promoting social responsibility, supporting essential services and caring for the vulnerable segments. In Phase Two (Heightened Alert), Volunteer Host Organisations (VHOs)2 can continue to enlist volunteers to support essential aid distribution (i.e. supplies necessary for daily sustenance e.g. cooked food and food rations, and urgent financial aid). With the tightening measures, volunteering associated with non-essential services will be suspended. For new activities involving essential aid distribution, VHOs should plan the modality to adhere with the prevailing safe management measures and submit to National Council of Social Service (NCSS) the following information of the activities via www.go.gov.sg/distributioncontact at least 3 working days before VHOs commence activities3. a) Name of VHO b) Person-in-charge and contact details c) List of staff and volunteers d) Number of beneficiaries served e) Type of essential aid (e.g. cooked meals, personal care products, vouchers) f) Modality and frequency of essential aid distribution g) Number of staff/ volunteers needed to distribute essential aid Apart from essential aid distribution, VHOs can also respond to other community needs so long as these activities adhere to safe management measures and guidelines for the specific sector4. Plans on essential aid distribution should also be submitted to NCSS. VHOs can conduct volunteer activities in groups of two persons with no inter-mingling between groups, and in accordance with safe management measures and sector guidelines. VHOs should also collaborate and coordinate with partners to minimise duplicative efforts, and reduce the movement of staff and volunteers and physical interactions. Avoid general outreach and door-to-door visitation, except for cases in need of urgent aid5. Notwithstanding the above, VHOs are strongly encouraged to carry out their volunteering activities remotely or in virtual format wherever possible, e.g. via telephone and video-conference. This is still the best way to keep our volunteers and beneficiaries safe. See Table 1 for a summary of the approach for volunteering activities. Table 1: Summary of the approach for volunteering activities Volunteering Activities Approach a. Volunteering activities supporting essential aid distribution Inform NCSS via this link www.go.gov.sg/distributioncontact, and adhere to safe management measures b. Volunteering activities to support other essential community needs Conduct volunteer activities, involving groups of up to any two persons, with no inter-mingling across groups, and adhere to safe management measures Assess risk and apply safe management measures VHOs must conduct volunteer activity risk assessment to assess the format for the activity and deployment of volunteers (See Annex A for an illustration). Should face-to-face interactions be necessary for volunteering activities, VHOs must ensure compliance with safe management measures. These measures include: a. As a default, measures should be put in place to ensure that individuals maintain safe distancing of at least one metre at all times; b. Where not feasible or practical to apply one metre safe distancing between individuals, this one metre requirement should be enforced between groups, with each group made up of no more than two persons, and with no mixing between groups. c. Ensure no cross deployment or social mixing among different groups of volunteers and schedule their volunteer activities, if possible, in fixed teams, to minimise interactions between volunteers and staff. d. Ensure staff and volunteers wear a mask at all times. Staff and volunteers should not participate if unwell. e. Encourage staff and volunteers to observe good personal hygiene, e.g. wash their hands regularly and refrain from touching their face. f. Avoid involving children, persons with chronic or underlying conditions, and pregnant women as volunteers. However, these individuals can take on virtual volunteer roles that allow them to operate from home. g. Limit the number and physical movement of staff and volunteers involved to minimise the risk of transmission. Implement staggered working and break hours and timings of volunteering sessions to reduce possible congregation at common spaces. Keep a register and track movement using a movement log, in order to facilitate contact tracing, if necessary. h. Reduce frequency and duration of physical interactions with beneficiaries, e.g. consolidate essential aid to be delivered to reduce the number of physical trips and avoid physical interactions by leaving supplies at the door. If there is a need to check on the beneficiaries, volunteers to maintain at least 1m safe distance. For beneficiaries who are seniors, deliver essential aid to their doorstep as far as possible, so that they do not have to venture out to do collection. i. Where it is not feasible to arrange for delivery, designated collection points can also be set up in the vicinity for beneficiaries to collect the essential aid with the necessary precautionary measures to ensure safe management. Buffet set-ups are strictly prohibited. Volunteers must not congregate and should minimise physical interaction with beneficiaries. j. Enable contact tracing to be carried out quickly and effectively by using the SafeEntry or TraceTogether-only SafeEntry system to log the check-in and check-out of staff and volunteers from premises. VHOs should ensure that they are ready to implement TraceTogether-only SafeEntry from 17 May 2021. This is a free-for-use service. Visit to sign up for SafeEntry NRIC or SafeEntry QR or for TraceTogether-only SafeEntry, and to refer to the user guidelines and FAQs. Upon registration, an onboarding guide with links to all the key resources, digital posters, step-by-step user guides and demo videos will be provided. k. Require staff and volunteers to download and activate the TraceTogether app. This will help MOH to more quickly identify potential close contacts of COVID-19 patients and reduce disease transmission. Data recorded by TraceTogether is stored on the user’s phone, and is only uploaded when required by MOH, e.g. when the user is suspected to have COVID-19. More information on TraceTogether can be found at Ensure safety and well-being of volunteers VHOs must continue to ensure the safety and well-being of their volunteers. The volunteers should be informed about the risks, and the measures taken by the VHO to protect them. This can include a briefing on the volunteer activity and precautionary measures, and shall be conducted remotely online, where possible. VHOs are to provide a contact number for volunteers to call in case of emergency or if they feel distressed. VHOs shall also actively seek feedback from volunteers and help to address their concerns, if any. Even with safe management measures and gradual resumption of activities, there is a risk that COVID-19 transmission may happen. VHOs must be prepared to help volunteers who have contracted COVID-19 in the line of duty. This can include helping them to apply for relief under The Courage Fund6, and to extend support for their families during this period of time. VHOs should also provide emotional support to any volunteer who needs it, and can tap on the National Care hotline. VHOs should also find ways to show their appreciation for their volunteers’ efforts, which can include sharing positive stories through the SG Cares App, providing words of encouragement, and tokens of appreciation. Sustain engagement of supporters and volunteers VHOs are strongly encouraged to continue to communicate and engage their supporters and volunteers during this period even if they are not deployed. This will allow VHOs to activate volunteer resources quickly when the situation improves. Activities by VHOs can include doing the following remotely: a. Keep supporters informed of the current happenings and initiatives; b. Share stories to motivate volunteers to step up; c. Encourage creative and safe ways to volunteer, both remotely and on-site; d. Build online communities and social networks; and e. Leverage online volunteer opportunities portals, communication tools and learning resources (See Annex B for a list of resources). These measures will be revised in tandem with future adjustments in MOH’s guidelines. Depending on the risk assessment and our safe management practices, MCCY will issue further advisories to guide VHOs on the management and deployment of volunteers. We need to remain cautious and stay safe as long as the risk of COVID-19 transmission remains. Working together to emerge stronger The community and volunteers shape a caring and united Singapore. With everyone playing their part and supporting each other, we can overcome this pandemic and emerge stronger. For enquiries For clarifications or enquiries, VHOs can write in to SGCares@mccy.gov.sg.

       " {'text': 'J OINT ADVISORY Page 1 of 4 MR No.: 034/21 Updated Safe Management Measures For Food & Beverage and Online Retail Delivery 1. The Multi-Ministry Taskforce (MTF) announced on 14 May 2021 that safe management measures will be further tightened to reduce the risk of community spread, with effect from 16 May through 13 June 2021. During this period, all Food & Beverage (F&B) establishments can only operate for takeaway and/or delivery. Dining-in is not permitted. In addition, online retail is encouraged for retail establishments to minimise in-store dwell time. These measures are to reduce physical interactions and risk of transmission within the community. 2. In line with this, Enterprise Singapore (ESG) and the Land Transport Authority (LTA) are providing operational guidance on safe management measures for businesses providing delivery services for F&B and retail establishments. This includes in-house delivery operations, third-party delivery businesses, as well as taxis and private-hire cars (PHCs)1 , which can continue to make grocery and food deliveries. All such delivery personnel must comply with these measures. The information in this document supersedes that in previous advisories or statements. Food Delivery 3. Companies providing food delivery services must comply with the following: 3.1. For delivery personnel 3.1.1. Wear masks at all times during their work. 3.1.2. Minimise contact and interactions with others at all times and not cluster together when waiting to collect food items or during breaks (not more than 2 persons in a group). This includes interactions with employees from F&B establishments, customers and other delivery personnel. 3.1.3. Comply with the one-metre distancing measure with other individuals, including other delivery personnel. If an F&B outlet is overcrowded, they should wait outside the establishment, maintain a safe distance from other delivery personnel or customers, and only enter the outlet when food is ready for collection. 3.2. For F&B establishments 3.2.1. Opt for contactless pick-up, where food orders are placed by the F&B establishment at designated locations for pick-up by delivery personnel. 1 In March 2020, LTA announced a temporary liberalisation of regulations to allow the use of taxis and PHCs for grocery and food deliveries. This arrangement will continue to be in place until end September 2021.Page 2 of 4 3.3. For customers 3.3.1. Opt for contactless receiving of food, where food orders are left by delivery personnel at designated locations (e.g. at the doorstep) for pick\\x02up by customers. Online Retail Delivery 4. Businesses providing online retail delivery services must comply with the following: 4.1. For delivery personnel 4.1.1. Wear masks at all times during their work. 4.1.2. Minimise contact and interactions with others at all times and not cluster together when waiting to collect items or during breaks (not more than 2 persons in a group). This includes interactions with employees from retail establishments, customers and other delivery personnel. 4.1.3. Comply with the one-metre distancing measure. They should only enter the retail establishment when the retail item is ready for collection. 4.1.4. Leave the premises as soon as bulk items have been put in place. 4.2. For retail establishments 4.2.1. Opt for contactless pick-up, where items are placed at designated locations for pick-up by delivery personnel. 4.2.2. For on-site installation, employees responsible for delivery and installation must comply with stringent hygiene and safe management measures, and leave the premises once installation is completed. The number of employees involved in the installation should be kept to no more than 2 workers. 4.3. For consumers 4.3.1. Opt for contactless receiving of items, where items are left by delivery personnel at designated locations (e.g. at the doorstep) for pick-up by customers. Contact Tracing 5. Delivery personnel are encouraged to download the TraceTogether mobile app or use a TraceTogether Token2 to facilitate contact tracing; this will help protect themselves and the community. 6. When entering establishments for collection of items, they must do their SafeEntry check-in (via TraceTogether-only SafeEntry) and temperature screening where required. 6.1. The following retail establishments are required to deploy SafeEntry: • Malls and large standalone stores; • Large retail stores > 930 sqm or 10,000 sqft; • Supermarkets; • Personal care services e.g. hairdressers, barbers, spas, beauty and wellness; and • Facilities providing basic pet services (that do not function on a drop-off, pick\\x02up basis). 2 For those using the TraceTogether Token, they are reminded to check the battery level. A green blinking light indicates that the Token is functioning properly whereas a red blinking light indicates that the battery is low. Page 3 of 4 6.2. Note that i) large retail stores > 930 sqm (or 10,000 sqft) and ii) supermarkets located within a TraceTogether-only SafeEntry building (e.g. malls) that have the same operating hours as the building are not required to deploy SafeEntry check\\x02in for customers, vendors and visitors (including delivery personnel). However, those located within a TraceTogether-only SafeEntry building but with longer operating hours must implement TraceTogether-only SafeEntry outside the building’s operating hours. 6.3. As per current practice, it is not necessary for delivery personnel to do SafeEntry check-in at F&B establishments. Cleanliness and hygiene measures 7. All delivery businesses must comply with the following: 7.1. Carry out daily temperature screening and health declaration among employees, including delivery personnel before they start work. Those who are unwell cannot work and must go to the doctor. 7.2. Ensure adoption of cleanliness and hygiene practices and compliance with MOH health advisories. 7.3. Delivery personnel who are eating or drinking in the course of their work must wear their masks immediately after doing so. They should dine alone, keep a distance of at least one metre from any other individual and refrain from interacting with other individuals. 7.4. Equip delivery personnel with hand sanitisers. Personnel must be reminded to wash their hands with soap and water regularly. In the event that they are unable to do so in between deliveries, they should keep their hands clean by using the hand sanitisers. 7.5. Delivery personnel must frequently clean carriers such as food carriers, food bags and food warmers for food delivery, and other forms of carriers and boxes for retail delivery. The frequency of cleaning and disinfection should be commensurate with increased usage. 7.6. Delivery personnel should not place their personal items (e.g. water bottles) in the same box, carrier, or insulated container, which are used to hold food ordered by customers. 7.7. Businesses can refer to NEA’s guidelines of Interim List of Household Products and Active Ingredients for Disinfection of the COVID-19 Virus for information3 . Businesses will need to ensure appropriate use of disinfectants and ensure they do not come into contact with food. 8. Employers, employees and delivery personnel must exercise social responsibility by observing good personal hygiene and monitoring their health conditions. Employees and delivery personnel must reduce physical interactions and not have meals in groups. Those who are unwell, even with mild flu-like symptoms, must see a doctor and stay at home to prevent spreading illness to others. Communications 9. All companies providing delivery services must provide clear communications and reminders to delivery personnel to ensure compliance with the above safe management and baseline sanitation and hygiene measures. 3 4 of 4 Enforcement of measures 10. Government agencies will be stepping up enforcement of these safe management measures. Under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act passed in Parliament on 7 April 2020, first-time offenders will face a fine of up to S$10,000, imprisonment of up to six months, or both. Subsequent offences may face a fine of up to S$20,000, imprisonment of up to twelve months, or both. 11. Businesses that do not implement or comply with the government’s safe management advisories may also be ineligible for government grants, loans, tax rebates and other assistance.

       " {'text': 'UPDATES ON LOCAL SITUATION AND HEIGHTENED ALERT TO MINIMISE TRANSMISSION 14TH MAY 2021 The Multi-Ministry Taskforce (MTF) has been closely monitoring the local and global COVID-19 situation. The number of locally transmitted COVID-19 cases and unlinked community cases has continued to increase. This is concerning as the situation could quickly escalate if these cases are not contained swiftly and decisively. Update on Local Situation 2. We have detected several clusters of infections emerging in the past 2 weeks around (i) an ICA officer and his extended family, (ii) Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH), (iii) Tuas South Community Care Facility, and (iv) Pasir Panjang Terminal. Most recently, we have an emerging cluster at Changi Airport Terminal 3 with a total of 46 cases to date. 3. To reduce the risk of any spread from undetected cases in the community, we have cast a wide net and taken swift action to detect, isolate, and ringfence any possible emerging transmissions to the community. We have carried out mass surveillance testing of persons with possible exposure to cases surrounding these clusters, such as TTSH patients and visitors who were at TTSH during the infectious period. Special testing operations have also been conducted to test port workers who had been deployed at Pasir Panjang Terminal, as well as workers at Changi Airport Terminals 1 and 3 and Jewel Changi Airport. Since 1 May 2021, we have also implemented additional pre-emptive measures to minimise interactions at both social settings and workplaces so as to break the chains of transmission to the community. These measures were further enhanced with effect from 8 May 2021, with reductions in the prevailing group size of social gatherings and the size of larger scale events or activities, to minimise the likelihood of large clusters forming. 4. However, a pattern of local unlinked community cases has emerged and is persisting. This is worrying as it suggests that there may be unknown cases in the community with possible ongoing community transmission and that our earlier and ongoing measures to break the chains of transmissions may be insufficient. We need to act decisively to contain these risks as any one leak could result in an uncontrolled resurgence of cases. Hence we will move to impose targeted restrictions on higher risk settings such as those where there is a high density of people who are unmasked for prolonged periods. Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) in the Fight Against COVID-19 5. Following the measures introduced on 8 May 2021, we need to tighten more measures to decisively arrest the increasing number of cases in the community. The following measures will take effect from Sunday 16 May 2021 through Sunday 13 June 2021. A) Further reductions in permissible group size 6. We will further reduce the current permissible group size of up to 5 persons to up to 2 persons, and the cap of 5 distinct visitors per household per day to 2 distinct visitors per household per day. Individuals should continue to limit their overall number of social gatherings to not more than 2 per day, whether to another household, or meeting with friends and family members in a public place. 7. In order to allow families’ current childcare arrangements to continue, grandchildren being cared for by their grandparents on a daily basis would not be counted towards the cap of 2 distinct visitors per household, or to the number of social gatherings per day. However grandparents are strongly encouraged to be vaccinated against COVID-19, to protect both themselves and their grandchildren from COVID-19 infection. To reduce the risk of transmission, grandparents should also minimise intermingling between grandchildren from different households. B) Minimising Workplace Interactions 8. Work-from-home will be the default at workplaces. Employers must ensure that employees who are able to work from home do so. There should continue to be no cross-deployment of workers to multiple worksites. Employers should continue to stagger start times of employees who need to return to the workplace and implement flexible working hours. Social gatherings at the workplace will not be allowed. Employees may have meal breaks at the workplace, but refrain from intermingling with their colleagues when their masks are taken off. These measures will lower transmission risks by reducing overall footfall and interactions at common spaces at or near the workplace, and in public places, including public transport. C) Cessation of Indoor “Mask-Off” Activities 9. The recent clusters have demonstrated higher attack rates and secondary transmission occur in mask-off settings, households, and at eateries. To reduce risks of community transmission, indoor “mask-off” activities such as dine-in F&B establishments will cease during this period. Other activities which will also not be allowed during this period include strenuous indoor exercise class or strenuous individual and group indoor sports and exercise activities. In addition, personalised services which require masks to be removed (e.g. facials and saunas), singing, and the playing of instruments that require intentional expulsion of air (e.g. wind or brass instruments) will also not be allowed. These restrictions will not apply to medical and dental consultations that require patients to have their masks off. Please see details in following paragraphs and in Annex A. 10. Cessation of Dine-in Food and Beverage (F&B). Dine-in F&B establishments are a higher-risk setting as customers often dine for prolonged periods in close proximity with one another with their masks-off. To reduce the risk of community transmission, dine-in F&B establishments (including hawker centres and foodcourts), both indoor and outdoor, will only be able to offer takeaway and delivery options. 11. Reduction of Activity and Event Sizes and Pre-Event Testing Requirements. To minimise the likelihood of large cluster formations, we will further scale down event sizes and lower the event size caps. Pre-event testing (PET) remains an essential measure to help ensure that events can proceed safely for attendees. More details on PET can be found on the MOH website. a. Congregational and other worship services. Congregational and other worship services may continue with a reduced capacity of 50 attendees at any one time without PET, or up to 100 attendees at any one time with PET implemented. To further mitigate the risk of spread through aerosol transmissions, religious workers and all other participants must wear their masks at all times. Live singing and playing of wind instruments will also be suspended during this period. b. Shopping malls and showrooms. The occupancy limits for shopping malls and showrooms will be further reduced from the current limit of 10sqm per person of Gross Floor Area (GFA), to 16sqm per person. Odd and even date entry restrictions on Sundays for popular malls will continue. c. Attractions and shows. The operating capacity of attractions that have received MTI’s prior approval will be reduced to 25% from the current permissible capacity of 50%. Indoor and outdoor shows may proceed with up to 100 persons with PET, and up to 50 persons without PET. d. Museums and public libraries. Museums and public libraries will be allowed to operate at a reduced capacity of 25%. e. Cinemas. Up to 100 persons may be allowed into cinema halls with PET implemented. Without PET, only up to 50 persons may be allowed. The prevailing group size of 2 persons applies, and food and beverages may not be sold or consumed in the cinema. f. MICE and live performances. Up to 100 persons may be allowed with PET, and up to 50 persons may be allowed without PET. Unmasking is not allowed for speakers and performers, and there should be no singing or playing of instruments that require intentional expulsion of air (e.g. wind and brass instruments). g. Wedding receptions and solemnisations. - In line with measures on dine-in F&B establishments, wedding receptions will not be allowed. - Marriage solemnisations may continue for up to 100 participants with PET and 50 participants without PET. h. Funerals. The cap for attendees applicable to all days of the funeral, including the burial/ cremation, is 20 persons or less, down from 30 persons currently. Attendees are reminded to maintain safe distancing and keep masks on at all times to reduce the risk of transmission. Targeted Support Measures A) Enhanced Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) Support for F&B Firms 12. In view of the cessation of dining-in at F&B establishments, the Government will increase the JSS support rate to 50% of the first $4,600 of gross monthly wages paid to local employees during the period for which dining-in is prohibited. This is an increase from the 10% support for wages paid up to June 2021. B) One-Month Rental Relief for Hawker Centres and Coffeeshops on Government-owned Premises 13. To support hawkers and coffeeshop stallholders, who are self-employed and do not benefit from the JSS, the Government will provide one month of rental waiver for hawker stall and coffeeshop tenants of Government agencies. Commercial landlords are urged to support their F&B tenants through this period. Use of Face Shields 14. Research has demonstrated that face shields cannot substitute masks in protecting the wearer from droplet infection. More importantly, face shields do not adequately prevent droplet spread if the wearer is infected. Face shields should therefore not be used as a substitute for mask wear, except for medical exceptions; or where the child is 12 years or younger; or for the marriage couple during the solemnisation of their marriage. Expansion of Testing Strategy 15. The above measures will continue to be complemented by our testing, contact tracing, and vaccination capabilities, that we have built up over the past year to manage community spread. Testing, in particular, is one of our key defensive tools to quickly identify individuals who have been exposed to the virus and reduce chances of further spread. Active surveillance and routine testing of targeted groups, such as those with higher risk of exposure to COVID-19, and testing for those diagnosed with Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI) with a COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test has enabled quick detection of unlinked cases in the community. For swifter detection of possible cases, we will be also begin Antigen Rapid Testing (ART) for all who present themselves with ARI symptoms at our Swab and Send Home (SASH) Public Health Preparedness Clinics (PHPCs), Polyclinics, Emergency Departments and Regional Swab Centres (RSCs). This ART will be done together with the PCR test that all such patients are already subjected to. Both the ART and PCR tests will be funded by the Government for all individuals with ARI symptoms. While the ART is less accurate than the PCR test, and there will be more false positives and false negatives, the ART’s quicker turnaround time compared to a PCR test1 will allow us to take any public health actions more quickly for persons who test positive by ART. 16. This enhanced testing regime will be rolled out progressively, starting with around 200 SASH PHPCs that are already licensed as ART providers from 15 May 2021, and will be expanded to include all SASH PHPCs through May alongside Polyclinics, Emergency Departments in hospitals, and RSCs. Along with our use of digital tools, such as the TraceTogether and SafeEntry programme, these measures will enable us to quickly identify and draw wide rings around cases and their close contacts. Keeping our Vulnerable and Community Safe 17. Vaccination remains critical in our fight against the pandemic. We have continued to make steady progress with our vaccination programme, having started with our most vulnerable, such as healthcare workers, elderly, and workers with high risks of exposure to COVID-19. As of 13 May 2021, we have administered more than 3.2 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine. About 1.9 million individuals have received at least one dose of the vaccine, of whom about 1.3 million individuals have received their second dose and completed the full vaccination regimen. 18. The recent cases illustrate that vaccination may not eliminate the risks of infection completely. However it provides significant protection against infections and helps to reduce the severity of the disease and onward transmission. Vaccination thus remains a key enabler and its ability to help us re-open safely can only be felt when we achieve a high level of population coverage for vaccination. Hence, we urge everyone to be vaccinated when it is offered to you. Observe all safe management measures, see a doctor, and get tested if you feel unwell. It is only together, that we can emerge stronger and safer.

       "[{'text': \"sm tharman the global jobs crisis and why we should think longer term We are on uncharted terrain. COVID-19 is a historic challenge, but we are really faced with three testing realities at the same time. We have the immediate challenge of a public health and economic crisis, both of global scale. But tackling this is complicated by the second reality - that of a new future that is already unfolding before us, for which we have to re-gear ourselves. The shape of demand, supply chains and the way work is organized are all changing, and with them the job market. COVID-19 and the fear of future pandemics have brought on a new normal that we must adapt to. Third, we inherit long-standing legacies, now made more challenging by the COVID-19 crisis: the stagnation of middle incomes in the advanced world, widening inequalities, the growing prospect of pension gaps in many countries, and an ever more serious climate crisis. It is these three realities interacting together that make this an immensely complex, dynamic and daunting time — for public policy, for society, and for politics everywhere. Focusing on today’s problems in themselves, without both addressing the problems we inherit and equipping ourselves for a structurally different future, will make the years to come even more testing, and fraught with danger. Too early for creative destructionPolicy-makers have passed the first phase of tackling the economic crisis, where most nations were focused on avoiding the extreme downsides arising from COVID-19 and lockdowns. We wanted to avoid mass unemployment and a large wave of bankruptcies, which would have led to a self-reinforcing spiral of declining incomes and public spirit. We are now at a transition point. We cannot protect existing jobs, firms and industry capacity to the extent seen in the first phase. Most countries do not have the fiscal capacity to do so. Strategically too, we have to let some of today’s firms and jobs go, to enable new growth and more promising jobs to be created. We have to allow for ‘creative destruction’, to secure vibrant economies over the longer-term.However, we cannot pivot policies too quickly into this next phase. Our economies are still in significant slack, the virus is far from tamed, and there is risk of repeated lockdowns especially during the northern winter. Even on optimistic assumptions, it will take much more than a year to get back to full economic life. Furthermore, withdrawing support too quickly will not lead to efficient market restructuring — the rechanneling of labor, capital and other resources that takes us to a better place — in the way we would expect in a typical downturn. We are operating with little visibility of the future, hampering the ability of either policymakers or markets to discriminate between firms that are loss-making today but remain viable for the future and the zombies that limp along on life support. Creative destruction without this visibility will lead to too many good firms and jobs being destroyed. The Central Problem: JobsThe central economic problem of the times lies in labour markets. First, there is a real prospect of prolonged high unemployment in many economies. It is not at all assured that we will get back to tight labor markets, even with traditional macroeconomic policies working the way they should. Second, we have to counter the long-term stagnation of median incomes seen in a whole range of advanced economies, with a few like Sweden and Singapore being the exceptions. It cannot be achieved without reviving productivity growth.Third, we have to address the trend towards a polarized job market — with more jobs being created at the high and low skilled ends of the labor market and fewer in the middle, and the growth of an insecure gig workforce. Each of these is a difficult challenge, and overcoming all three even more so. While employment recovered well in some major economies in the decade after the Global Financial Crisis, productivity growth weakened (and indeed was part of the reason why employment recovered) and job polarization became more severe. There have been some periods in history where we were able to achieve all three objectives. One of the drivers of economic development, which Nobel Laureate Arthur Lewis and other economists highlighted, consisted of surplus labor being freed up from low-productivity sectors (originally agriculture) and taken up by sectors which had higher productivity such as manufacturing. That reallocation of labor is how low-income countries became middle income, and some middle-income countries became advanced. But the experience of recent years in many advanced economies has been the reverse — with labor being shed from industries that are dynamic and at the higher end of the productivity ladder, and channeled into lower-productivity, lower-wage occupations. In fact, the main engine of job growth in the United States and several other countries has been in lower-paid services — in F&B, cleaning, security, and a range of other domestic services.COVID-19 has introduced a major disruption to this already polarized, barbell-shaped market. The bottom end of the barbell is now itself shrinking. A whole range of service tasks is being eliminated by e-commerce, remote work, virtual presence, and the safe distancing and other new protocols that we will probably have to live with for some years. What this means is that the market receptacle for labor displaced from higher productivity industries has shrunk. It was a receptacle of lower-pay and less secure jobs, but what is even more unattractive now is the prospect of fewer such jobs. We also face, in particular, the unravelling of some of the gains in women’s participation in the labor force and sense of self-determination that were achieved over decades. Women have been disproportionately represented in the human-facing jobs that are being hurt. The closure of childcare and schools, each time it happens, has also unfortunately translated into more women than men staying at home to look after their kids. We have to apply ourselves now and over the next few years to this central problem of jobs: making sure we have enough jobs, and that people do not get trapped over time in low skill, low pay work. Widening the distribution of good jobsWhat are some of the initiatives that we have to focus on? We have to focus not only on macro-economic stimulus, but increasingly on the microeconomic incentives we create, and on new forms of collaboration between government, business and communities. First, we have to gradually phase out subsidies for existing jobs and instead provide strong incentive for job creation. In other words, we should shift from subsidizing the stock of jobs towards incentivizing the flow of new jobs. Singapore is doing so with our Jobs Growth Initiative, as we step down the significant subsidies for today’s jobs that our Jobs Support Scheme provided in the first phase of the crisis. Second, we have to put great energy into the coordination needed to help people who are displaced to get back into jobs, and to avoid as much as possible ill-fitting job matches that could lead to a permanent reduction in their wages. We must do all we can to avoid people being detached from work for an extended period, to prevent the depreciation of skills and morale that comes with that, and increased barriers to their employment. Economists call it ‘hysteresis’. It is a real risk in the coming months and years.However, the aim of job matching cannot simply be about speed. It is not about getting someone any job as soon as possible, because that can mean losing the value of the skills they have accumulated. As much as possible, we have to find jobs that build on a person's skills and experiences. A key coordination task, therefore, is to find those jobs with adjacent or complementary requirements, and to move swiftly to top up the skills that the job-seeker brings. We cannot take too long to help someone secure a new job, but we have to strive for a good match with the human capital they have accumulated, so that they do not lose it, and society does not lose it. Getting to this outcome is not easy, because labor markets suffer from imperfect information. It requires joining up career coaching, job matching and skills development programs. This is a very human enterprise, but greatly aided now by new ICT and AI tools. The most effective systems have involved official agencies playing an active coordinating role, working with employers, job-seekers, unions or other social partners, and training providers. In the context of the current uncertainties, significant state subsidies are also required to encourage employers to recruit and train people. If we leave it to the market, we will see longer spells of joblessness.We have to recognize too, in the wake of the pandemic, that it will take time before hiring for permanent jobs comes back on the scale we need. We have to incentivize firms to take in people on attachments of various forms, even if they cannot take on permanent hires. This means not just youth apprenticeships, but traineeships for mature workers in their 40s and 50s. We have to work with industry partners to curate traineeships, get people back into the workplace, and help them to add to their skills. We must find every way to avoid a long-term detachment from work, and the permanent scarring that comes with that. Third, we have to go beyond the mantra of life-long learning, to make it a practical reality for blue-collar and ordinary white-collar workers. All experience, even in northern Europe where the tradition is most established, shows that it has been much harder to get this going for ordinary workers than for high-skilled professionals, which only accentuates existing inequalities. That has to be a core focus of public-private collaboration – developing quality training options that workers find appealing and relevant to their careers, and using technologies and community outreach programs that make learning convenient when they are not on the job. It also requires increased agility in the system, to enable firms and workers to develop new skills quickly as the economy restructures. Fourth, we have to encourage those forms of automation that create new tasks or stimulate new demands that play to human strengths. Technological advances have historically both displaced workers and increased the demand for labor in new areas — either within the same industry or indirectly in the rest of the economy. It has enabled society to stay fully employed while productivity moved up. But that is an empirical regularity, not a law. Serious economists, as well as business and technology leaders themselves, have differing views on whether we can be equally sanguine about an emerging generation of increasingly potent technologies, or whether we are heading for a permanent state of higher joblessness. We will not know in advance. But we know that some new technologies, like collaborative robots, augmented reality and certain AI tools, generate more demand for human skills, including mid-level skills, than other advances. Tax codes today incentivize automation in almost every form and everywhere, even in countries where labor markets face significant long-term slack. It is not too early to consider how public policy can encourage automation and skills development of the kinds that can complement one another, so we increase the chances of a new era of widely-distributed good jobs. Fifth, we need collectively-determined solutions to ensure that growth of worker compensation does not trend below productivity growth, as has happened over the last few decades in many economies. Institutional interventions, involving the state, are especially needed where the problem of low or lagging wages reflects either the weakened bargaining power of workers or increased monopsony power of employers. Ideally too, these interventions should be accompanied by efforts to develop new social and employer mindsets, so that new norms can persist in the labor market without requiring perpetual state intervention. Norms do appear to vary across countries, especially with regard to pay for women and less-skilled workers. Sixth, we need strategies to ensure that the SME sector survives and adapts to the new, post-pandemic normal, to avoid much larger job losses in time as well as greater wage inequalities. SMEs are disproportionately represented in the service sectors, where jobs have been most vulnerable to the impact of COVID-19 and national lockdowns. They also face greater funding risk than large firms in an environment of uncertainty. While a churn of businesses is inevitable and needed, there is a real risk of a diminished SME sector as a whole, compounding the increases in industry concentration seen over the last few decades in many economies. That trend if it continues will have implications for future economic vibrance. It will likely also have an intangible impact on social capital. Governments and central banks have been quick to ensure near-term credit support for SMEs. But we have to look beyond this. Quite apart from updated competition policies, what form of cluster strategies can we get to work well, and to enable better diffusion of innovation from the frontier firms to the rest? How do we incentivize test-bedding of innovations in small firms themselves? How do we aggregate and organise skills training for their workers, to address the growing gaps in skill levels between large and small firms? How do we promote digital platforms — and especially inter-operable cross-border platforms — that small firms can plug into, so they can benefit from the scale economies of the digital economy?Monetary and FiscalPolicies: Taking the Long View Monetary policy has succeeded in buffering economies and financial systems against a severe shock to confidence amidst COVID-19. However, relying chiefly on monetary policy to get economies back to full health will be less effective over time and holding interest rates near zero over a prolonged period may have counter-productive effects.Fiscal policy therefore has to play a more important role, in concert with labor market and industrial policy reforms. But it also requires a repurposing of the state - to defy secular stagnation, to catalyse the green economy, to rekindle social mobility and build equal opportunities, and to go about these objectives with a spirit of activism.Expansive fiscal policies will make sense for a while, probably a few years in most economies. But the real debate has to move from questions around immediate stimulus effects, to how we achieve our longer-term goals. We need a different kind of Keynesianism: an active state aimed at long-term recovery and regeneration, nationally and globally.We have to refocus on public goods, which used to be a fundamental purpose of government budgets. They are now greatly underinvested in, not only in the emerging world but in most advanced economies. The pandemic was a harsh reminder of this, with public health systems overwhelmed in many countries. But this is now a huge opportunity around the world: investments to achieve broad-based quality in public education systems, including regularly refreshed technical and applied training; in more accessible and affordable healthcare; in universal broadband access; in upgraded water and transport networks; in R&D for clean energies, sustainable agriculture and the circular economy.We will not be able to fund these investments on public balance sheets alone. The redesign of fiscal strategy must also involve catalyzing private investment in public goods. There are many examples of how this can be done, including ways to achieve a fair sharing of the risks on such investments.Remember that this pandemic is not the last we will face, and the next pandemic may very possibly be more challenging than what we are going through today. So we do need, once we have emerged from this crisis, to rebuild fiscal space to deal with future shocks – and at least avoid a continuing build-up of debt-to-GDP ratios. Most governments will have to strengthen tax revenues. They will have to do so while giving a fair deal to those with lower and middle incomes, and ensuring that fiscal systems meet the challenge of politically durability.The repurposing of the state requires boldness of imagination, and the marshalling of public support around nations’ long-term goals. It will help rebuild broad-based prosperity and cohesive societies, and can put us on course to an ecologically viable future. It may be our only chance.Tharman Shanmugaratnam is Senior Minister and Coordinating Minister for Social Policies.

       " {'text': 'driving the sustainability spirit in our local community 1.6 million kilograms of food redistributed and prevented from going to waste– that’s what a team of 10 persons from the Food Bank Singapore achieved last year. That is equivalent to the weight of about 104 single-deck SBS Transit buses. The Food Bank Singapore was founded by siblings Nichol Ng, 43, and Nicholas Ng, 42 who run a food distribution business. Through their work, they observed that Singapore had been generating a tremendous amount of food waste. “Most of us who were born post-independence never had to struggle with putting food on the table as Singapore is a food haven – make that an affordable food haven. Where else can you get a $3.00 hot meal in a first world country? Because of this, some of us do not think twice about dumping food,” Nichol says.Nichol and Nicholas Ng (middle), co-founders of Food Bank Singapore and their teamThe Ngs realised that together with their peers in the F&B industry, they were well-positioned to play a much bigger role in fighting food waste and food insecurity in Singapore.Using innovation to overcome constraintsBut tackling food waste and food insecurity was not at all easy. In fact, things became even tougher with the COVID-19 pandemic.For one, there was a severe drop in volunteers. “We rely mostly on volunteers to get the work done. With COVID-19, we had to make do with fewer volunteers in a confined space to sort out the food,” Nichol explains. In addition, it was extremely challenging to distribute food to households during the Circuit Breaker period, with the limited manpower and COVID-19 regulations in place.Even though the organisation was given the greenlight to operate during that period (“We had the opportunity to go door-to-door”), the Food Bank team had to devise ways to streamline manpower, working closely with the Ministry of Social and Family Development to cross-check the names of beneficiaries so that the assistance rendered would not be duplicated. Another innovation that’s in the works is the Virtual Food Banking App, “It is something that will change the way food aid is being distributed once we get it fully off the ground. The idea is to go digital as much as possible with our ops,” Nichol says. Despite facing many challenges during the period, the team has continuously worked on fresh projects to break new grounds to improve the efficacy of food distribution. Fixing the buy and throwaway culture Previously a mechanical engineer, Danny Lim, 53, joined Repair Kopitiam as a Community Innovator after hearing about the corporate social responsibility project by Sustainable Living Lab, a local movement looking at sustainability issues. “People come here to attend coaching sessions, to learn how to fix their beloved barang at the community repair meetup sessions, and give their barang a new lease of life,” says Danny. Besides consumerism, another factor that deters people from learning how to fix their own appliances is the fear of getting an electric shock. Many of us may relate to our parents’ reminders, like “Don’t touch the sockets with your wet hands, otherwise you will get an electric shock,” says Danny, who adds that repairing appliances is safe, as long as you take the necessary precautions. Appreciating the value in objectsDespite having a mechanical engineering background, Danny explains that it was not at all easy to apply his knowledge at the community repair meetup sessions. He often encounters different repair problems and unique challenges with people coming forward to repair their items. “Interpersonal skills are more important than repair knowledge here”, Danny chuckles.Danny Lim (2ndrow, third from the right) with his team of volunteers at Repair KopitiamAs sharedby Danny, the objective of running these community repair sessions is to helpchange people’s mindsets that things can be repaired and inspire them to learnhow to repair. People from all walks of life come to the sessions to get thingsrepaired for various reasons, including saving money, or to save items ofsentimental value. Some of thesevisitors, who initially turned up to get help to fix their items, later becamerepair coaches themselves, after seeing the value of the sessions. Repairingitems can also help seniors with mild cognitive impairment. Seniors with this impairment often find it difficult tooperate new appliances, as their memory to operate such items remain in thepast. “Mild cognitive impairment is reversible if the person can find a hobbythat requires troubleshooting and logical diagnosis,” Danny explains. Repairingthese items can help them to struggle less in operating their older appliances.Witnessingthese positive outcomes, Danny encourages more people to join the communityrepair meetup sessions. “Come toRepair Kopitiam and get a slot with us, don’t just throw it (broken appliances)away. Start sustainability small – it can be from zero to hero.”SingaporeGreen Plan 2030The Singapore Green Plan 2030 was launched recently as awhole-of-nation movement to advance Singapore’s agenda on sustainabledevelopment. Nichol says that she sees the plan as a means for NGOs and organisations to push ahead boldly with sustainability ideas. “It is an extension of what we are already doing as a country for years. The plan has given our country something even more concrete to work towards beyond just growing the GDP numbers.” Danny shares similar sentiments, “To me, it’s about actionable, achievable targets which can help movements like Repair Kopitiam collaborate with other like-minded individuals and organisations to do more by sharing resources.” Share your ideas for the SG Green Plan 2030 at: greenplan.gov.sg/take-action/share-your-ideas/ What you can do Volunteer and participate – get involved with the community here Become a NEA volunteer: nea.gov.sg/programmes-grants/volunteering Become a Food Bank Singapore volunteer: foodbank.sg/volunteer-new/ Become a Repair Kopitiam volunteer: repairkopitiam.sg/volunteer/ Practice the 3Rs – reduce, reuse and recycle: Reducing, Reusing, Recycling: 5 fun facts Adopt an energy-efficient lifestyle and use energy-efficient appliances Some tips to prevent food waste Don’t shop on an empty stomach because you tend to buy more when you’re hungry Housekeep your office inventory and home pantry/refrigerator regularly Make a shopping list before you head out to get your groceries When dining out, bring a container and takeaway what you cannot finish Support local whenever you can.

       " {'text': 'food security its not just about the eggs As supermarket shelves emptied out at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and as supply chains bringing in food from other parts of the world were disrupted, we wondered: What if our food runs out?After all, more than 90 percent of Singapore’s food comes from other countries.The fact is, that is very unlikely.Behind the scenes, public servants and other agencies work hard to ensure that Singapore is able to get safe, quality food from many different countries. Not just eggs, but also meat, vegetables, rice, and food types we are used to.This did not just take place during COVID-19, but is the result of years of effort which is paying off now.In fact, Singapore was ranked number 1 in the world in the Global Food Security Index – which measures if people have access to affordable, quality food - for the second year running in 2019.Who makes sure Singapore has food?Many different agencies are involved, in taking care of different aspects of Singapore’s food supply.Some of these include the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) which oversees food safety and security, the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI), Enterprise Singapore (ESG), and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) to facilitate agri-trade and tie up importers with potential new suppliers overseas.During COVID-19, many other agencies were involved in safeguarding Singapore’s food supply, including even Singapore Airlines to fly in food.What do they do?They collectively work to make sure that Singapore gets its food from as many countries as possible. Food supply can be affected by not just pandemics. Climate change, global population growth and geopolitical changes could affect supplies from some countries in future.Today, Singapore buys food from over 170 places around the world.“By diversifying our import sources, we avoid being overly-reliant on any single source country and spread the risk of food supply disruption across as many sources as possible,” said Mr Goh Wee Hou, Director of SFA’s Food Supply Resilience Division. “This way, if supply from any source country is disrupted, the impact would be minimised.”How is this done?SFA works with importers to organise overseas sourcing trips and business matching sessions to explore new sources and business opportunities.Their officers also go overseas, to scout for new companies and farms which Singapore can buy food items such as meat and eggs from.Said Mr Goh, “We also work with overseas authorities to accredit as many farms and countries to export to Singapore as possible, as long as they can meet our food safety requirements.”For instance, people in Singapore consume 1.97 billion chicken eggs every year. Since 2016, SFA has worked to increase the number of approved countries for eggs from seven, to 14 today.Was Singapore’s food supply really at risk at the start of COVID-19?No. Because of these efforts, even though there was some panic buying when COVID-19 first struck Singapore, supply of food remained stable.There were some concerns over flow of food imports when Malaysia first announced its Movement Control Order, which restricts the movement of people and goods across its borders.When some importers became worried about their food supplies, SFA officers remained on standby to take their calls and assured them that essential items like food would be allowed to enter Singapore.SFA also worked together with MTI and ESG to monitor the food supply situation, MFA to keep in close touch with regional and international partners, as well as the Customs and the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority to ensure that food supplies move smoothly across the borders to Singapore.At the start of the pandemic, because some air routes were closed, there was also an increase in freight costs to fly in food from some countries, like chilled pork from Australia.Said Mr Ong Xuan Feng, Assistant Director of SFA’s Industry Development & Partnership Division, “This was quickly managed as importers were able to switch to alternate sources where necessary. Later on, the Australia authorities committed to keeping supply lines open through weekly flights.”Can Singapore produce more of the food we consume?That’s the plan. Even though local farmers produce less than 10 percent of the nation’s nutritional needs at the moment, SFA is aiming to increase this to 30 percent by 2030.On this “30 by 30” goal, Mr Goh said, “Although import source diversification has served us well, COVID-19 underscores the importance of having a buffer in case of global supply disruptions.”In fact, because of COVID-19, SFA is accelerating “30 by 30” by putting aside $30 million to give grants to people or businesses in Singapore which can quickly ramp up the production of eggs, leafy vegetables and fish in the next six to 24 months.', 'id': '7e416c02-b820-492b-9688-cc8d457431e2', 'score': None, 'probability': None, 'question': None, 'meta': {'category': 'articles'}, 'embedding': None},\n",

For instance, the development of an Integrated Environmental Modeller helps urban planners maximise thermal comfort for residents. Agri-Food Cluster Transformation Fund $60 million has been set aside to further support tech adoption in the agri-food sector. Changing the future of transportEmissions can be reduced by going car-lite, as well as by switching to cleaner-energy vehicles. Electric vehicle (EV)-related initiatives $30 million will be set aside over five years for initiatives such as developing charging infrastructure. The Government aims to deploy 60,000 charging points at public carparks and private premises by 2030. To encourage the adoption of electric cars The Government will narrow the cost difference between EVs and internal combustion engine cars, e.g. lowering the Additional Registration Fee floor to zero from Jan 2022 to Dec 2023,and revising the road tax treatment for electric cars. To discourage the use of internal combustion engine vehicles Petrol duty rates will be raised by 15 cents per litre for premium petrol and 10 cents per litre for intermediate petrol. To offset the petrol duty increase: Motorcycles using petrol will be given a 60% road tax rebate. Individual owners of smaller motorcycles up to 400cc will receive a petrol duty rebate of $50, or $80 in cash Active taxi and Private Hire Car Drivers using petrol and petrol-hybrid vehicles will be given a petrol duty rebate of $360 over 4 months, on top of 15% road tax rebate Goods vehicles and buses using petrol will receive 100% road tax rebate Cars using petrol will receive 15% road tax rebate Green financingGreen finance is an important enabler for sustainability efforts. The Government will issue green bonds on selected public infrastructure projects to catalyse the flow of capital towards sustainable development in Singapore and Asia.Up to $19 billion of public sector green projects have been identified to be financed with green bonds as a start. One such project is Tuas Nexus, which integrates waste and water treatment facilities, and maximises energy and resource recovery in the solid waste and used water treatment processes.A whole-of-society effortThe public sector will take the lead in the Environmental Sustainability Initiatives.

Efforts to systematically test and clear migrant workers and dormitories will continue.Some imported cases20 imported cases were detected over the past week, mostly comprising returning Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents. A few are Work Pass or Dependant’s Pass Holders who have been approved to return to Singapore.To prevent community transmission from imported cases, travellers are isolated under Stay-Home Notices upon arrival to Singapore. They are also tested if they become unwell or before they end their Stay-Home Notice.Increase in community cases, over half are linkedOver the past week, an average of 12 community cases are detected a day, an increase from around 8 community cases a day in the prior week.Linked community casesOver half of these community cases (57%) since the start of Phase One are linked. These are detected through active case finding efforts, aggressive ring-fencing efforts around confirmed cases, and intensive contact tracing efforts to quarantine close contacts quickly.The most common mode of transmission amongst linked cases are households. Some transmissions occur in workplaces, especially those at frontline COVID-19 operations.Due to the tight restrictions imposed, fewer transmissions take place through social gatherings. However, continued vigilance is necessary as more social activities resume in Phase Two.Unlinked community casesRegular testing has also picked up unlinked community cases. About 6 in 10 were asymptomatic, or displaying no symptoms, and almost half are likely to be past infections who tested positive under serology tests.Half of unlinked cases have been from the construction sector and occupations, such as building trades workers and electrical instrument fitters. Two-thirds are likely to be past infections that are unlikely to be currently infectious, which could have been transmissions from earlier clusters. The construction sector therefore continues to be at a higher risk setting for transmission, as it is challenging to maintain strict safe management and distancing measures.The remaining unlinked cases in the community currently continue to remain in the low single digits. Increased testing has helped to identify these cases.Everyone should continue to stay vigilantWhile the number of unlinked community cases currently remain low, everyone should remain vigilant and adhere to safe management measures to reduce the spread of the virus.This is especially critical as cases will increase when more activities resume in Phase Two.Individuals should continue to use TraceTogether and SafeEntry to facilitate contact tracing, see a doctor if feeling unwell, and play their part to keep COVID-19 under control.Source: Ministry of Health', 'id': '23c12676-15d4-450c-97c5-c287891988d1', 'score': None, 'probability': None, 'question': None, 'meta': {'category': 'articles'}, 'embedding': None},\n",

       " {'text': \"how to keep safe when you dine out So, it's a special occasion and you’ve made plans to dine out at your family's favourite restaurant (though remember that delivery and take-out orders can be just as special!).Whether it's a celebratory dinner, or a quick cuppa at the coffee shop, here are some tips for you to remember, so you can keep yourself and your loved ones protected while dining out.1) Avoid crowdsIf takeaway or delivery is not an option, then try to make reservations or order in advance wherever possible. This would help reduce the amount of time you spend waiting for a seat or for your food to arrive. Dining during off-peak periods would also help you avoid the lunch and dinner crowds, especially for popular eateries.2)Use TraceTogether and SafeEntrySafeEntry QR codes should be a familiar sight by now – you can facilitate contact tracing and identification of clusters by checking in and out wherever required. You can use the TraceTogether App or Token to do this.3) Mask up and follow safe management measuresWhen arriving at the eatery, allow the staff to take your temperature. Eating or drinking should be the only time you take off your mask while you’re outside. So keep your mask on till your food arrives. When you do take it off, you’ll need to keep your mask somewhere clean. This is where a ziplock bag can come in handy, to ensure that your mask is not left exposed to the surroundings while you enjoy your meal.4) Limit your dining group to 8 people. If you need to meet your friends in person over a meal, make sure to keep the group as small as possible, with the maximum of eight people. Keep in mind that it’s still best to keep your circle of contacts small, and preferably to a regular circle of close contacts.5) Always practise safe distancing. F&B establishments will have in place safe management measures to ensure that groups are at a safe distance from each other. Nevertheless, do make sure you keep at least 1m apart from other groups, and to not mix between groups. If you intend to dine in a mall, check out www.spaceout.gov.sg for crowd levels in malls before you head out. You can also reduce contact with others by opting for contactless payment methods.6) Practise good hygiene and do not share utensils While you may be tempted to help your friend finish their last bit of food on their plate, it is important to avoid sharing food or utensils, as viruses are spread through droplets like saliva. Instead, use serving spoons. Also, remember to wash your hands with soap and water often, or use a hand sanitiser.For more tips on how to stay safe, check outGov.sg How-Tos.\", 'id': '03497142-8084-42e5-820c-73ebc6846d17', 'score': None, 'probability': None, 'question': None, 'meta': {'category': 'articles'}, 'embedding': None},\n",

       " {'text': 'pm lee hsien loong overcoming the crisis of a generation PM Lee spoke about the impact of COVID-19 on Singapore. It is not only a public health issue, but also a serious economic, social and political problem. The Government has intervened through four successive Budgets to protect workers, households and companies. However, these measures cannot shield us from tectonic shifts in the global economy. But we can be confident. Singapore has economic strengths and an international reputation built up over many decades, and a head start preparing for uncertainties with future economy strategies. We are rebuilding transport and trade links, and making our supply chains more resilient. We are also working to retain and attract talent and investments to contribute to our recovery. The Government’s priority is to help Singaporeans keep jobs or find new ones. We have to strengthen our social compact and improve our social safety nets. For Singapore to succeed, we need the unity and resilience of our people. Full transcript:My fellow Singaporeans,Good evening.Our fight against COVID-19 continues.We have made good progress. In the community, new cases have come down. In the migrant worker dormitories, the situation has stabilised. Our healthcare system is coping well, thanks to the outstanding work of our healthcare professionals, and many others on the frontline. Most importantly, among both Singaporeans and migrant workers, we have kept fatalities low – one of the lowest rates in the world.As a result, we have been able to move out of the circuit breaker. We are opening up our economy and society, progressively and safely. As we ease up, I expect the number of cases to rise somewhat, as has happened in other countries. So we are moving cautiously. We want to avoid the numbers shooting up again, and having to impose a second circuit breaker. We will step up testing and contact tracing significantly. Then we can catch new cases early, isolate them and their contacts, and stamp out clusters before they grow. If all goes well and the outbreak remains firmly under control, we will ease up further, and resume more activities as soon as possible. In the meantime, please continue to play your part: maintain personal hygiene and wash your hands frequently, wear a mask when you are out, and keep a safe distance from others and avoid crowded gatherings. COVID-19 will remain a problem for a long time yet. It will take at least a year, probably longer, before vaccines become widely available. We will have to learn to live with COVID-19 for the long term, as we have done in the past with other dangerous infectious diseases, like tuberculosis. We also have to get used to new arrangements in our daily lives. We must all adjust the way we live, work and play, so that we can reduce the spread of the virus, and keep ourselves safe.Economic ImpactBut COVID-19 is not only a public health issue. It is also a serious economic, social and political problem. It is in fact the most dangerous crisis humanity has faced in a very long time.Because of COVID-19, the global economy has virtually ground to a halt. Governments have spent trillions of dollars to support businesses, economies and jobs. Yet, tens of millions of jobs have been lost. Families are experiencing hardship. We are in a totally unprecedented situation.Singapore has taken a severe hit too. Our GDP is likely to shrink between 4 and 7% this year, our worst contraction ever. To protect workers, households and companies, the Government has intervened decisively through four successive Budgets. We are injecting almost $100 billion – 20% of our GDP – the largest fiscal intervention in our history. Unlike other countries, we can draw on our reserves, and do not have to pay for our support measures by borrowing. But even for us, this level of spending is hard to sustain. More importantly, these measures cannot shield us from the tectonic shifts taking place in the global economy.Singapore depends heavily on international trade and investments. These were already slowing down before COVID-19. Now this slowdown will happen faster, and go further.We will not be returning to the open and connected global economy we had before, anytime soon. Movement of people will be more restricted. International travel will be much less frequent. Health checks and quarantines will become the norm. It will no longer be so easy to take quick weekend trips to Bangkok or Hong Kong on a budget flight. Industries that depend on travel, like aviation, hotels and tourism, will take a long time to get back on their feet, and may never recover fully.Countries will also strive to become less dependent on others. Especially for essential goods and services, like food or critical medical supplies. This will have strategic implications. Countries will have less stake in each other’s well being. They will fight more over how the pie is shared, rather than work together to enlarge the pie for all. It will be a less prosperous world, and also a more troubled one. All these developments will affect Singapore greatly. Since before the time of Raffles, we have made a living by connecting ourselves with the world. First, we were a trading hub, then an international seaport, then we made ourselves a hub for aviation, finance, and telecommunications. We have benefitted enormously from an open and connected global economy. Large parts of our economy – like manufacturing, biotech, financial services, and logistics – serve regional and world markets. Even many domestic sectors – like retail, F&B, and entertainment – rely heavily on tourism.Now, we have to prepare for a very different future. Companies big and small will be hit hard. Some industries will be permanently changed. Many will have to reinvent themselves to survive. Workers too will feel the pain. Retrenchments and unemployment will go up. Some jobs will disappear, and will not come back. Workers will have to learn new skills to stay employed. The next few years will be a disruptive and difficult time for all of us.We Can Be ConfidentBut despite these immense challenges, I say to you: Do not fear. Do not lose heart. Singapore will not falter in its onward march.I believe we can still secure a bright future for ourselves. An even stronger and better Singapore will emerge from this crisis.First, we have economic strengths and an international reputation built up over many decades. We are highly connected to the global flows of trade, investment, capital and people. International trade and investments may shrink, but they will not disappear entirely. Some flows will be diverted or dry up, but other new channels will open up. There will still be overseas markets, and opportunities for international partnerships. Singapore is well placed to connect ourselves to the new channels and flows, and create new businesses and jobs to replace those lost. We just have to work harder and smarter at it. Our strong, trusted international reputation will help us greatly. In a troubled world, investors will value the assurance of a government that plays by the rules. A people who understand what is at stake and a stable political system that enables businesses to continue operating even in a crisis. The way Singapore has responded to COVID-19 – openly and transparently, neither avoiding reality, nor acting arbitrarily at the first sign of trouble – has only strengthened this advantage.Second, we have had a head start preparing for the uncertainties ahead. For some time now, we have been working hard to transform and deepen our capabilities. Developing plans for our Future Economy, investing heavily to upgrade our workers through SkillsFuture, digitalising both the private and public sectors, building our innovation and R&D capabilities. All this has enabled us to stand out in Asia and the world. Nobody can predict what exactly the world will look like after COVID-19 but however things turn out, these Future Economy strategies will stand us in good stead. We need to pursue them even more vigorously now. For instance, we know that many businesses will no longer be viable. We will support these businesses to transform themselves, change their business models, or move into different and more promising fields. More immediately, we are systematically rebooting our economy, as countries emerge from lockdowns. We are rebuilding our transport and trade links. For example, Changi has already resumed transit flights. We are working out Reciprocal Green Lane arrangements for safe travel to China and other countries. We are making our supply chains more resilient. For example, we are diversifying our sources of food. We are even buying eggs from Poland, and shrimps from Saudi Arabia.Next, we are working hard to retain and attract talent and investments to contribute to our to our recovery. At a time when some countries are closing their doors, we are keeping ours open. By making the most of our head start, our workers and industries will survive the crisis better, and bounce back faster and stronger. Third, we have programmes and plans to cope with the challenges before us. The government’s biggest priority now is jobs – helping Singaporeans to keep their jobs, or find new ones. We are particularly concerned about those in their 40s and 50s, who are often supporting children and elderly parents at the same time, and have financial commitments to meet. We are also concerned about mature workers nearing retirement, who want to work for a few more years, to build up their nest egg for old age. Lower income workers, who have not much savings to fall back on. The self-employed and freelancers, who have less jobs and income security in the gig economy and fresh graduates who are entering the job market in a very difficult year.We have schemes to help all these groups. The Job Support Scheme, the Workfare Special Payment, the Self-Employed Person Income Relief Scheme (SIRS), the COVID-19 Support Grant and the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Package. These schemes have enabled people to hold on to their jobs, and provided income support for millions of Singaporeans and their families.We have set up a National Jobs Council, to pull together and drive all our efforts on jobs, and look at how we can create new jobs for the economy. Senior Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam is leading this. The Council will coordinate all the Government agencies involved, and bring in NTUC and the employer groups too, to maximise the impact of our efforts. So if you need a job, there are real options to pursue, and you will have help and support. Beyond COVID-19, and the economic challenges, we also have to deal with other important external and domestic issues. Externally, we have to navigate the changing strategic landscape. COVID-19 has worsened relations between the US and China. Actions and counter-actions are raising tensions day by day. It will become harder for countries to stay onside with both powers. It will be a more dangerous world for a small country like Singapore. We must ensure our security, and protect and advance our interests when dealing with other countries, big and small. We must also work with like-minded countries to support free trade and multilateralism, and enhance our voice and influence in the world. Domestically, we have to strengthen our social compact. We have taken emergency measures to help everyone come through the crisis together. Beyond that, we have to think carefully how to improve our social safety nets. Sustainable social support will give people confidence to cope with the uncertainties and to make changes to their lives. At the same time, everyone must have the incentive to be self-reliant, and to progress through their own efforts. We have difficult decisions to make on priorities, resources, and budgets but the values guiding us remain the same: every Singaporean will have equal opportunities. Whatever your starting point in life, you will have access to good education, healthcare, and housing. If you fall down, we will help you to get up, stronger. You can be sure you will be taken care of. In Singapore, no one will be left to walk his journey alone.In the next few weeks, several Ministers will address you, and share with you our plans. We have a full agenda for many years to come. Our People are Our StrengthFor our plans to succeed, for our hopes and dreams to come true, we need one final ingredient: the unity and resilience of our people. Once in a while, nations and peoples are severely tested, as we are now. Some buckle under pressure and emerge from crisis diminished. Others grow more determined as they face fearful odds, discover reserves of strength in themselves, and emerge from crisis transfigured, renewed. And that has been our Singapore story: in crises, we have never failed to wrest opportunity from danger.Indeed, our nation was born in crisis. When we were granted independence, it was in the expectation that we would fail and come crawling back, after realising we could not survive alone. We proved otherwise. Two years later, the British suddenly announced that they were withdrawing their forces from Singapore. Again, many thought that would be the end of us. And again, we proved them wrong. The Pioneer Generation fought to master their destiny. And the Merdeka Generation put heart and soul into making Singapore succeed. Together, they weathered many storms, always looking ahead, never flinching at hard choices and challenges. And that is how we got here.Now, at another hinge in our history, it is our turn to face the crisis of a generation. The choices that we make now will define who we are as a people, and what values and ideals we pass on to future generations. Confronting adversity, do we yield to anger, fear and bitterness? Or will we be true to ourselves, stand firm, make tough choices, and continue to trust and depend on one another.Many Singaporeans have stepped up during this crisis. They have become more, not less, than themselves. Healthcare workers, public officers, grassroots leaders and volunteers, and many more working quietly behind the scenes. Some are taking good care of migrant workers in the dorms. Others are sewing masks, buying groceries for families under quarantine, or refurbishing computers for needy students to do Home-Based Learning. Abroad, Singaporeans have driven hundreds of kilometres to pick up fellow citizens to catch SQ flights home. These acts of solidarity and human kindness exemplify the best in us. They show how we can emerge stronger from this crisis, with a sharper consciousness of being Singaporean. This is why I believe we can continue to be exceptional – a fair and just society, where everyone can chase their dreams. My Cabinet team, with the support of the whole public service, will do our best to lead us towards this enduring vision of what Singapore can be. We need every one of you to work with us. Together, let us take Singapore safely through this crisis, and make the Singapore spirit flourish in the world.Thank you.…..From 7 to 20 June 2020, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat, Senior Ministers Teo Chee Hean and Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Minister Chan Chun Sing and Minister Lawrence Wong will deliver a series of national broadcasts, explaining what a post-COVID-19 future looks like for Singapore.Click here for the other speeches.', 'id': '85ecf539-11cd-49d0-b3df-44a12f88881a', 'score': None, 'probability': None, 'question': None, 'meta': {'category': 'articles'}, 'embedding': None},\n",

Therefore, we have embarked on a phased approach to re-open safely. We are not going back to life before Circuit Breaker; the majority of our population have not been exposed to COVID-19 and are still vulnerable. We must be cautious in our re-opening. We will continue to monitor the situation in Phase 1, and we will be able to move to Phase 2 before end-June if conditions remain stable. But we must be mentally prepared to see more cases as we open up. The key is whether we can keep community rates stable.

Singapore is part of the massive global effort to develop a vaccine – an important part of the longer-term solution. But it will take a long time, and the virus is not likely to go away. We must adapt to COVID-19, learn to live with it over the long-term. We have to change the way we live and work – urban planning will need to cater to flexible work arrangements, companies will have to find safer ways to deliver products and services.

This is the Singapore spirit that gives us confidence to press ahead, and which will see us through this crisis of our generation.Full transcript:My fellow Singaporeans,Good evening.COVID-19 is the most serious health crisis the world has faced in a century.We have all seen the devastating effects of the virus worldwide. When the outbreak gets out of control, the spike in cases can quickly overwhelm the healthcare system. Many people will not get the care they need, and the number of deaths will rise sharply.We are determined to avoid the same fate in Singapore.That’s why we’ve been going all out to control the spread of the virus, and to ensure that our healthcare system is able to care for all who are infected.It has been a tough fight against a formidable and invisible enemy. We’ve had our share of challenges. But we faced them head-on.Working together we’ve stabilised the situation in the migrant worker dormitories. We’ve brought down community cases significantly. We’ve protected our seniors, and kept our fatality rates low. Most of all, I’d like to acknowledge all our officers serving on the frontline, including our healthcare professionals and volunteers. I’m speaking today at the NCID, the National Centre for Infectious Diseases, which has been at the forefront of this battle.You have all been working flat out, making sacrifices and exceeding the call of duty. So to all of you, I want to say a big Thank You.The strict measures and restrictions we’ve imposed over the recent months have been effective.But they come at a high price. We’re cushioning the impact on our businesses and workers with four Budget packages this year.But we cannot remain closed indefinitely as we have to prioritise both lives and livelihoods. The vast majority of our population have not been exposed to the virus and are still vulnerable to the disease. We want to continue to provide maximum protection for our seniors and those with medical conditions. Hence we have been very cautious in our re-opening.We are now in Phase 1 and we will continue to monitor the situation over the coming week. If the conditions remain stable, we will be able to move into Phase 2 before the end of the month.We will then resume a broader range of activities, covering nearly the whole economy, and allow social interactions and family visits in small groups of not more than 5 people.Externally, we are carefully easing travel restrictions and re-opening our borders, by creating “green lanes” with selected countries. These arrangements will be limited to essential travel for work reasons, and tight controls will be put in place.When conditions permit, we will extend “green lanes” to more countries, and to non-business travellers. But it will take a while before we see international air travel recovering in a significant way, or before we can open up for mass market travel.As we resume more activities, there will be more human contact and more opportunities for the virus to spread. So we must be mentally prepared to see more new cases.This has happened in many other places which exited from their lockdowns, and we must expect it to happen here too. Our ability to control the infection during this process of re-opening is therefore critical. And that’s why we’ve made use of the two months of circuit breaker to do two things.First, we’ve increased our capacity and speed of contact tracing by developing new systems. We have expanded our contact tracing teams, which now include personnel from the Police and the SAF.We are also using technology to speed up contact tracing. We have implemented the SafeEntry digital check-in/check-out system, and the TraceTogether app on smart phones. With these enhancements, we can now identify close contacts faster, isolate them, and prevent large clusters from forming.Beyond TraceTogether and SafeEntry, we are currently developing wearable Bluetooth devices. These will work on their own without the need for a phone. You can conveniently wear or carry them around, as you go about your daily activities. Second, we’ve expanded our testing capacity hugely. We are procuring more test-kits, building more laboratory capacity, and recruiting and training more laboratory technicians as well as personnel to carry out swabs and take blood samples.In early April, we were doing about 2,000 tests a day. Now, we are able to conduct about 13,000 tests a day, and we are on track to reach 40,000 tests a day in the coming months.This expanded testing capacity is critical. It means that we can test higher-risk groups more extensively. We can also do more surveillance testing in the community, including those with respiratory symptoms. This will give us a faster and more accurate sense of the number of cases circulating undetected.Besides the standard testing methods, we are deploying other means of detection.For example, we are extracting waste water from manholes to test for viral fragments. This provides an additional indicator to tell us if a specific group, such as those living in a dormitory, has infected people amongst them.We are also using serology tests – these help to identify those who were previously infected but may have since recovered, and have developed antibodies in response that can help them fight the virus.Aggressive testing and contact tracing will improve our ability to control the spread of the virus. They will help greatly in allowing business and life to resume progressively.In the longer-term, an important part of the solution is a vaccine.The good news is that there is a massive global effort to develop a vaccine. And Singapore is working on this too.We have a pharmaceutical industry, and research capabilities in biomedical science. EDB is also discussing with pharmaceutical companies to manufacture vaccines in Singapore. In parallel, clinicians and researchers around the world, including teams from Singapore, are working hard to develop drugs and other therapies to reduce the severity of the disease.But drug and vaccine development is very challenging work. There is no guarantee that the drugs currently undergoing clinical trials will be effective. And despite the intensive international efforts, it will take a long time for any vaccine to be ready and available for mass distribution.So we have to be realistic and gird ourselves for more challenging times. It is not likely that the virus will go away. Our population will be vulnerable for a long time, in a world where COVID-19 is all around us. What’s critical is people’s behaviour and mindsets. We must stay disciplined and vigilant, and not let our guard down. We must practise social responsibility in upholding good personal hygiene and safe distancing measures – wash our hands regularly, wear a mask wherever we go, avoid big gatherings and crowded places, and see a doctor immediately when we are sick.We’ve been emphasising all this for some time. But it bears repeating, because individually, these are steps everyone can take to protect ourselves and our loved ones.And collectively, these actions will make all the difference in keeping COVID-19 at bay. They will enable us to have a safe and sustainable re-opening, as we have seen in countries like Denmark and New Zealand. Conversely, if we are lax in our personal precautions, new cases and new clusters will multiply quickly, and despite our best efforts to test and trace, we might end up in another circuit breaker down the road.So please cooperate with the restrictions, and keep everyone safe.We also have to change the way we live and work.COVID-19 has precipitated a shift towards more flexible work arrangements. Working from home, staggered work hours, and split team arrangements are becoming more of the norm.Our urban plans will need to cater to these new demands. Office and building designs will also have to change, given what we now know about the risks of transmission in enclosed spaces.We will need to improve ventilation and air filtering inside buildings. Other features like contactless fittings, automatic doors, as well as hand sanitiser and temperature monitoring stations should also become part of the norm.Companies will have to find new and safer ways to deliver their products and services. Many are already embracing digital solutions. Some will need to change their business practices to adapt to the new environment. And I am happy that wet market stallholders and hawkers are now using digital payments more, and online platforms to reach new customers.One major impact is on our construction sector. Construction has been a key vulnerability in this pandemic. The industry will need to institute new safeguards at worksites, and continue its push for automation and productivity, in order to reduce its reliance on migrant workers.Workers in construction – local and foreign – will have to be tested regularly and comprehensively. We will also need to review and improve living arrangements for migrant workers.The present dormitories are in fact the outcome of improvements made over the past decade. But despite this, and the precautions we took, we still had major outbreaks in the dormitories.We will tighten the safeguards and build new dormitories designed to be more resilient against infection risks. But we have to be mindful that the risks will always be there, because of the large number of workers living together and sharing communal facilities. In fact, all communal living spaces, be they dormitories, nursing homes or cruise ships, will always be at risk in the event of an infectious disease outbreak.These are significant changes, which will mean extra costs for the construction industry.For now, the Government is bearing these costs through the Fortitude Budget. Beyond that, we will introduce other measures to cushion the impact, and to move the industry to new productivity levels. Ultimately, re-opening our economy and society does not mean going back to the status quo ante. I know many are looking forward to resume your favourite activities or to get back to your usual routines. But this is not the time for big celebrations or parties. We will all need to adjust our expectations, lifestyles and norms.We have shown our grit, adaptability and resilience during the circuit breaker, and we must continue to demonstrate the same ingenuity and resourcefulness in this new phase.For example, we have found new and creative ways to stay in touch with family and friends – chatting and exercising online, and even having virtual meals or drinks together.We may not be able to travel or have large gatherings anytime soon. But we are going on virtual tours, enjoying online concerts, and learning new skills through online classes. And many of us continue to draw strength from our faiths, thanks to churches, mosques and temples live-streaming their sermons and services to their followers. Every day, we see countless examples of Singaporeans from all walks of life going out of their comfort zones and going the extra mile – they are volunteering at the dormitories, distributing food to the elderly, and looking out for the vulnerable amongst us.Businesses too have been leaning forward to help – they are donating masks and supplies to those in need; and contributing to our frontline COVID-19 operations.This is the Singapore spirit that gives us the confidence to press ahead, no matter how tough the odds. The road ahead is unpredictable, and countries everywhere are continuing to search for answers and solutions. There is no guaranteed formula for success. So let us continue to stand together, unshaken in spirit and resolve. Whatever the challenges ahead, let us face them together. As one united people, we will defeat COVID-19 and we will prevail.…..From 7 to 20 June 2020, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat, Senior Ministers Teo Chee Hean and Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Minister Chan Chun Sing and Minister Lawrence Wong will deliver a series of national broadcasts, explaining what a post-COVID-19 future looks like for Singapore.Click here for the other speeches.', 'id': '586ade67-547c-4220-a5b4-f5957b7ddbae', 'score': None, 'probability': None, 'question': None, 'meta': {'category': 'articles'}, 'embedding': None},\n",
       " {'text': 'pm lees address on the covid 19 situation in singapore 21 april 2020 Fellow Singaporeans & ResidentsI am speaking to you again to give you an update on the COVID-19 situation We are now two weeks into the circuit breaker. On the whole, people have coped well. Most of us have played our part, staying at home, complying with the restrictions.We have adjusted to working from home and home-based learning. When outside, we wear masks and keep a safe distance from others. And we have kept to our immediate family units and avoided gatherings with extended family and friends.The number of new cases in the local community has levelled off, to below 30 new cases daily. This is the result of the circuit breaker, and all of us working together. But as you know, our total case numbers have risen sharply since the last time I spoke to you, just ten days ago. Today alone, we have over 1,100 new cases. Almost all were detected in our migrant worker dormitories, through aggressive testing.Migrant workersThe large number of cases at the dorms is a serious problem. To assess the extent of the spread, we have tested aggressively. Not only those who reported sick, or showed fever or flu symptoms. But also those who were well and asymptomatic.Almost all the migrant workers infected have only mild symptoms. This is not surprising as they are generally young, and thus much less likely to become seriously ill with COVID-19.Our doctors, nurses and healthcare personnel are also working hard, triaging them early, and taking good care of them. It is early days yet, but thankfully, so far none of the new cases of migrant workers have needed supplemental oxygen, or intensive care.We had one earlier case of a Bangladeshi worker, who was in the ICU for two months. This was Case 42. We never gave up on him. Last week, his condition stabilised. He was transferred out of the ICU, to a general ward. It will still take some time for him to fully recover. With some luck, he should be able to see his new-born son soon.We hope that the situation in the dorms will remain this way: most of the cases being mild, and very few needing oxygen or intensive care. All the major dorms are supported by dedicated teams of doctors and nurses.To protect the health of our migrant workers, we will step up the medical resources in the dorms. We will deploy more medical personnel, to make sure that anyone with fever or flu symptoms receives appropriate and timely medical treatment. We will house the mild cases either on site, in a separate facility within the dorm, or in community care facilities elsewhere. And we will make sure that those who need more active treatment receive immediate attention, and can be sent promptly to the hospital to help them recover.We will also pay special attention to the older workers, who are more vulnerable. We are pre-emptively moving them to a separate dorm, where they can be monitored more closely. We will look after your health, your welfare and your livelihood. We will work with your employers to make sure that you get paid, and you can send money home. And we will help you stay in touch with friends and family.Ramadan begins in a few days’ time. We will make sure that arrangements are made for our Muslim workers. When Aidilfitri comes next month, we will celebrate with our Muslim friends, just as we celebrated the Indian New Year with our Indian friends last week. This is our duty and responsibility to you, and your families.Apart from the workers living in dorms, we are monitoring two other groups of migrant workers closely. First, workers who live in shophouses, private housing, or HDB flats. Second, workers in essential services. This group is still working during the circuit breaker, helping to keep Singapore going. Some are cleaning the HDB blocks or hawker centres. Others are maintaining key infrastructure like our broadband networks.If these workers move in and out of dorms, they become potential channels for cross infection in both directions. Hence we are housing these essential workers separately. We are also testing them to make sure that they are healthy, and to pick up any infections early.So far, the clusters in the dorms have remained largely contained, and have not spread to the wider community. We will do our utmost to keep it this way.CommunityIn the wider community, the circuit breaker is starting to have an effect. The number of community cases has fallen in recent days. To bring down daily infections more sharply, to a single digit, or even zero. And to reduce the number of unlinked cases: those cases where we do not know how they got infected, or from whom.Because unfortunately that number of unlinked cases has not come down. And this suggests there is a larger, hidden reservoir of COVID-19 cases in the community, that is the source of these unlinked cases, which we have not detected.I discussed with the Multi-Ministry Task Force (MTF) on the next steps to take. We want to bring down the community numbers decisively. We also want to make sure that if any leakage occurs from the dorms to the wider community, we can detect and contain it early, and prevent new clusters from forming and bursting out of control. If you do need to go out, then go by yourself, not as a group or as a family. Even when exercising outside, do so only by yourself, and only in your own neighbourhood. Remember: it is not just about adhering to the letter of the law.The spirit of the guidelines is to reduce movement to a minimum, and to avoid being out and about in the community. This is the way to protect yourself, your family and everyone else. So I hope everyone can cooperate and do your part. Some hotspots, like some popular wet markets, are still a problem. Large groups of people continue to gather at these places, making it hard to practise safe distancing. These places will impose entry restrictions to thin out the crowds even more.You can do your part too. Do your marketing on weekdays rather than weekends, and don’t bring your whole family with you for grocery shopping. When you run errands, go out alone, get what you need, and return home straightaway.We will also close more workplaces, so that only the most essential services will remain open. This will reduce further the number of workers keeping essential services going, and minimise the risks of transmission among the workers. It will mean some degradation of services – for example, less frequent grass cutting in our HDB estates. But I hope we all understand why this has to be done. Then, provided we have brought the community numbers down, we can make further adjustments and consider easing some measures. This way, we can be more assured that we have made definite progress and consolidated our position.Many will be disappointed by the extension of the circuit breaker. Especially our businesses and workers, who are hurting greatly. But I hope you understand that this short-term pain is to stamp out the virus, protect the health and safety of our loved ones, and allow us to revive our economy.The Government will continue to help our businesses and workers cope during the extended circuit breaker period. We will provide the same level of support to our workers and businesses as we are doing now. The ministers will hold a press conference immediately after this to explain the details.ConclusionLet me conclude in English.You will naturally ask – where does this lead us? How do we exit from the circuit breaker?Nobody knows how long the pandemic will last. Most likely it will take more than a year, before effective treatments and vaccines become available. So we have to take things one step at a time.To exit from the circuit breaker, we need to do three things.First, we must open up incrementally, in small steps, making sure that we are safe each step of the way. This is what New Zealand and Germany are beginning to do, very cautiously. They believe that they have broken the chain of transmission, but they want to be extra careful. They do not want to open up prematurely after lock downs, only to find COVID-19 coming back, and then be forced to lock down a second time. It has happened in Hokkaido. We should try our best to avoid this.Second, we need to scale up testing for COVID-19 substantially, so that we can quickly detect any new cases that pop up. This we are progressively doing, not only by procuring test kits and equipment from other countries, but also by developing and manufacturing our own test kits.Third, we will need to make full use of IT, so that when we discover COVID-19 cases, we can trace more efficiently where they have been, and whom they have been in contact with.We have the TraceTogether app, and we are currently developing other apps for this purpose. For these apps to work, we will need everyone’s cooperation to install and use them, like what the South Koreans have done. There will be some privacy concerns, but we will have to weigh these against the benefits of being able to exit from the circuit breaker and stay open safely.I know this has not been an easy time for everyone. We are making progress, but we have not yet succeeded by a long way. The results show that the circuit breaker is working. We will overcome this together.

       " {'text': \"20 year old self taught engineer puts in 200 hours repairing laptops for those in need When home-based learning was introduced during the circuit breaker period, there was an urgent need to ensure that students from low-income households could access working laptops.While the Ministry of Education loaned out more than 12,000 laptops and tablets (as of April 15 2020) to students who did not have sufficient devices at home, other groups in the community stepped up as well.One of these was Engineering Good – a non-profit committed to engineering solutions for the local community.It started with an innocuous Facebook post appealing for donations of laptops for a beneficiary. Soon enough, replies started streaming in – tens, then hundreds – and the phone was ringing off the hook with requests and donations. The Engineering Good team buckled down to cope with the demand.20-year-old volunteer Darin Lobo, a diploma graduate in biomedical science and a self-taught engineer, was in the thick of it.“It went crazy at the start,” Darin says, recounting the first two weeks of laptop repairs. “I would work 14 hours continuously for about three to four days, then take a break and come back to it.” Engineering for the good of the communityDarin’s journey with engineering started when he was just 11 years old, after joining the maker community in Singapore. Through the community, he connected with like-minded individuals who were interested in building things, from websites to apps, with prototype tools like 3D printers, all in a Do-It-Yourself setting.He slowly picked up electronics and engineering skills, learning from other members as he went along.A friend then introduced him to Engineering Good, which started as a passion project to engineer solutions for the less fortunate. Some projects the organisation has worked on include low cost assistive switches for people with conditions such as cerebral palsy and muscular dystrophy.Then, the COVID-19 situation hit.In order to stem the spread of the virus, home-based learning was introduced in all schools in Singapore.The Engineering Good team stepped up to fill the need for laptops in the homes of students – particularly those from low-income housholds.Thus the initiative Computers Against COVID was born.Heart for hardwareDarin and team quickly set about repairing the donated computers: updating software, fixing hardware issues, installing the programmes required for home-based learning, and ensuring quality control.The computers are then sent to the various beneficiaries through social workers, who assign them to those who need them the most.The initial days were the most challenging for Darin. It was demoralising when multiple computers could not be fixed, and the mental exhaustion of doing repetitive tasks wore Darin out.However, he soon learnt to pace himself and work sustainably. Futhermore, a helping hand was always near. When faced with a seemingly unsolvable problem, a WhatsApp message to the Engineering Good group would generate many ideas and solutions.These past two months, Engineering Good has repaired and delivered over 2,000 computers.100 volunteers, from different walks of life, undertake all manner of tasks from repairs to delivery and liaison with social workers.Darin estimates that he has spent about 200 hours repairing laptops, a number he humbly dismisses as “not much of a big deal”. Knowing that these repaired laptops would benefit someone makes all the difficulties worth it. “It's an extremely tiny sacrifice taken by me. If I spend just an hour fixing a computer, that computer may help improve the life of an individual or family for potentially years,” he adds.“Initially, you're just repairing laptops, looking at pieces of hardware and you don't really think about the impact,” he says.“But after that, a lot of people send us 'thank you' notes and pictures of themselves with their laptops. That's when you start seeing that there is actually a significant impact there.”Inspired by maker communityThrough his time in the maker community attending events, as well as volunteering with Engineering Good, Darin says that the community around him inspires and motivates him.In the maker community, Darin has met “hundreds of people who are doing little things [to give back to the community] here and there”.Asked about who he’s looked up to while serving the community, he quips that he has “too many role models” and has simply met “too many interesting people” to speak about in the span of an interview.Of his experience working on Computers Against COVID, he says, “It is quite inspiring that so many people are taking time from their busy lives to work on this effort. It is also great that this effort fosters so much teamwork.” Not stopping just yetEngineering Good isn’t stopping there. They are now looking to turn Computers Against COVID from a spontaneous effort to something more continuous and sustainable.In addition, they intend to educate people on how to repair computers, and to supply computers not just for home-based learning, but for all who need them.Darin is not stopping either, despite confessing that he has “too many hobbies” and “multiple projects going on at the same time”. On top of his work with Engineering Good, he is also on standby as a COVID-19 swabber under MOH, while waiting to enlist in National Service.Still, volunteering ranks high on his priorities. “It's quite hard to not be motivated when you can make such a difference with a relatively small amount of effort,” he says. To other youths looking to give back to society, he urges, “Learn to both enjoy the task you are doing as well as the meaning behind it. It will serve to motivate you.”This article is part of a series of stories of Singaporean youth who have come forward to help the community, during this fight against COVID-19. Many have stepped up during this time to help SIngapore overcome COVID-19.For more stories of youths who embody the #SGUnited spirit: The Beng who feeds the hungry Siblings sew and donate over 300 masks to the needy Avid volunteer delivered meals to 500 families Find out how you can do your part for the community:\", 'id': '232e1d73-0d83-4496-9b4b-0bcd96330a0f', 'score': None, 'probability': None, 'question': None, 'meta': {'category': 'articles'}, 'embedding': None},\n",

       " {'text': 'post circuit breaker when can we move on to phases 2 and 3 Updated 28 May 2020As announced by the Multi-Ministry Taskforce on 19 May 2020, Singapore will embark on a three-phased approach to resume activities safely, post-circuit breaker.Phase One of this approach involves the safe re-opening of economic activities that do not pose high risk of transmission.It includes the resumption of selected services, like motor vehicle and aircon servicing, all hairdressing services, selected health services. Schools will start to reopen.For more details on Phase One (Safe Re-Opening), click here.A critical pre-condition for us to be able to move into the next phase or ease certain measures further within each phase, is to have improved capabilities to control and contain any subsequent outbreaks.Hence Singapore will continue building our capabilities in the following areas: Expanding our testing capacity to be able to diagnose cases early, screen all individuals at risk, and protect the more vulnerable groups Speed up contact tracing to identify and isolate close contacts of infected persons Ensure sufficient healthcare capacity to deal with any potential surges in cases that we must still expect from time to time If community transmission rates remain low, Singapore can then move to Phases Two and Three in subsequent weeks. Phase Two (Safe Transition)The Government will carefully monitor the effects of increased activity in Phase One, and if the community infection rates remain low and stable over the subsequent two weeks, Phase Two could happen before the end of June.In Phase Two, almost the entire economy will re-open, subject to safe management measures being in place. More activities will resume. Retail, F&B, and other services Most businesses will be allowed to resume, with safe management measures, group size and capacity limits in place. These include retail, F&B dine-in, personal health and wellness, as well as home-based services. Sports and other public facilities, e.g. stadiums, swimming pools, will be opened too. Social interactions and family visits Masks will remain compulsory whenever outside one’s home. Small-group gatherings of up to 5 persons will be allowed. Within one’s home, households may receive up to 5 visitors per day. As seniors are especially vulnerable, they should exercise caution and stay at home as much as possible. To support them and their caregivers, more senior services and programmes, such as senior care centres, will resume with appropriate safe management measures in place. Schools Schools will fully re-open from end June, while Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) will gradually increase the number of students back on campus at any one time for face-to-face learning.For higher-risk activities, the Government will be engaging businesses and organisations on how and when they may resume safely, with the necessary safe management measures and safeguards. Such activities include: Religious services and congregations Cultural venues such as art galleries, libraries and museums Large-scale events and venues, such as conferences, exhibitions, concerts and trade fairs Entertainment venues such as bars, nightclubs, karaoke outlets, cinemas, theatres, and other indoor and outdoor attractionsDepending on the COVID-19 situation and the Government’s risk assessment, the measures (e.g. size of gatherings) will continue to be eased gradually until we reach a new normal in Phase Three.Phase Three (Safe Nation)This will be the ‘new normal’ for Singapore, as we expect to remain at this state until an effective vaccine or treatment for COVID-19 is developed.What’s expected to be allowed: Social, cultural, religious and business gatherings or events would have resumed Gathering sizes would have to be limited in order to prevent large clusters from arising. Seniors would be able to resume day-to-day activities Safe distancing measures need to be practised, peak period travel, crowded places and large groups need to be avoided. Public commutesAs more of us return to work and school, more will be taking public transport. Businesses should stagger working hours to minimise travel during peak periods. Commuters will have to wear a mask, refrain from talking to one another or on their mobile phones, and maintain good personal hygiene. Cleaning of buses and trains will be stepped up.Opening of bordersSingapore will gradually re-open our borders for Singaporeans to conduct essential activities overseas and to allow safe travel for foreigners entering or transiting through Singapore. Necessary precautions and safeguards will be in place. As the global situation remains volatile, such moves will be assessed and implemented separately from the timing of the three phases of re-opening outlined above.For more on what we can do to resume activities safely, click here.', 'id': 'e7d2e4e1-950b-4eac-a895-b53b1a814df4', 'score': None, 'probability': None, 'question': None, 'meta': {'category': 'articles'}, 'embedding': None},\n",
       " {'text': 'improved standards of new dormitories for migrant workers As more migrant workers are recovering from COVID-19 or being cleared to resume work, the Inter-agency Taskforce (ITF) is currently working with dormitory operators and employers on the housing arrangements for these workers.Currently, some workers have been housed temporarily in sites such as army camps and sports halls, as well as vacant HDB blocks and private apartments slated for redevelopment.To reduce the current density in the dormitories, the Government will be building additional dormitories with higher standards over the coming months and years. Short-to Medium-Term ArrangementsBy the end of 2020, additional space to house around 60,000 workers will be created through the following: New Quick Build Dormitories (QBDs), which are temporary structures that can be constructed quite quickly with a low density. These dormitories will last for around two or three years, and can house about 25,000 people in total. Unused state properties, including former schools and vacant factories, will be temporarily fitted out to house around 25,000 people in total. The Government is in discussion with contractors on building additional Construction Temporary Quarters (CTQs) to house their workers near the worksite and cut down on the need for transportation. Longer-Term ArrangementsMoving forward, there are plans for new purpose-built dormitories (PBDs) to house up to 100,000 workers, which will replace the temporary accommodations built this year. This new building programme will take several years to complete, with the aim of having 11 new PBDs ready over the next one to two years.All of these dormitories will have amenities like minimarts, barber services, indoor recreation facilities, and blocks will be well spaced out to ensure good ventilation. Workers living in these dormitories will have ready access to medical care and support.With the additional housing capacity in place, the Government will be able to decant workers from existing dormitories, and undertake major upgrading of these dormitories to ensure that the new standards are met.Improved standards and dorm operating model will be pilotedA set of standards and specifications will be developed for the new dormitories, which will look into the design, facilities, management and regulation of these dormitories, and will factor in social interaction and disease response needs.These efforts aim to make dormitory living and design more resilient to public health risks, including pandemics. Lessons learnt from the current COVID pandemic will be taken in, with feedback sought from relevant stakeholders.These improved standards will be piloted in the upcoming quick build dormitories (QBDs): Living space per resident: at least 6 sqm (not including shared facilities), from at least 4.5 sqm per resident (including shared facilities) currently. Maximum of 10 beds per room, where only single deck beds will be used with 1m spacing between the beds. Currently, there are no limits on the occupancy per room. In practice, dormitories typically have 12-16 beds per room, with mostly double decker beds. One toilet, bathroom and sink to every 5 beds, an improvement from every 15 beds currently. More sick bay beds – at least 15 per 1,000 bed spaces. An improvement from the current requirement of just one sick bay bed per 1,000 bed spaces.The Government is also studying the possibility of developing the purpose-built dormitories on a different model compared to the present system, where currently land is released for commercial operators to bid, build, or operate.Everyone has a part to playWhile physical standards are being improved, it is also important to uplift the capabilities of dormitory operators and adjust the daily living habits of dormitory residents. The pilot aims to instil a new level of discipline on safe living within dormitories.The additional and improved housing arrangements is expected to come at a cost, which is necessary to keep workers safe and allow Singaporeans to continue benefiting from their contributions. Adjustments may be made for permanent new dormitories based on the pilot’s effectiveness, scalability, and sustainability.Given Singapore’s land constraints, some dormitories will be located closer to residential areas. This will require the support from Singaporeans as well, in appreciating the workers who keep Singapore going.

MOM also announced a multi-layered approach to ensure safe restart of work on 11 August that aims to minimise the risk of renewed infections and protect the health of the workers.Allowing dormitory residents to leave during rest daysMOM recognises that social activity is important for the mental well-being of dormitory residents and is working towards allowing them to leave for leisure and personal errands whilst keeping them safe from COVID-19. The eventual goal is to allow residents from dormitories cleared of COVID-19 to enjoy their rest days without movement restrictions.MOM has engaged employers, NGOs, dormitory operators, and Recreation Centre operators to coordinate the measured relaxation of movement restrictions to ensure that the residents and broader community are kept safe and healthy.Small-scale trials this month would allow residents from selected cleared dormitories to visit Recreation Centres on their rest days for personal errands such as buying groceries, SIM cards, and remitting money. Residents’ exits will also be spread out across each rest day through the application of Dormitory Exit Passes by residents provided they meet the necessary criteria*. Details of the eventual Exit Pass arrangements will be announced in due course.MOM extends its appreciation to workers and employers for their cooperation over these last four months and understands their anxieties. The Ministry seeks the cooperation of all stakeholders to ensure that dormitory residents can eventually enjoy their rest day safely.*Residents would be granted a Dormitory Exit Pass if they meet the following criteria: Has recovered from COVID-19, or has a negative swab test result within 14 days prior to the exit date; Not be on Quarantine Order or Stay-Home Notice; Is staying in a cleared dormitory Has installed and registered TraceTogether; and Chooses an Exit Pass timeslot with available vacancies', 'id': 'cb850105-ea46-42f9-9d56-5c2fe4082cd9', 'score': None, 'probability': None, 'question': None, 'meta': {'category': 'articles'}, 'embedding': None},\n",

       " {'text': 'what you can and cannot do during the circuit breaker period From 7 Apr 2020, Singapore entered the circuit breaker period, in order to pre-empt escalating COVID-19 infections. During this time, Singaporeans are advised to stay home as much as possible.In tandem with the circuit breaker, a new law [the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act 2020] was passed in Parliament on 7 Apr. To reduce the risk of infection, the new law bans all gatherings with family or friends who do not live together. Gatherings at home, public spaces (like HDB void decks and parks) are also banned.With these new regulations, you may have questions on what you can or can’t do. Here are answers to some of them.In GeneralQ: When can I leave the house?A: You may only leave the house for one or more or the following reasons: To work for or with an essential service provider, specified schools or early childhood development centres To send your child to childcare if you and your spouse work for an essential service provider To get essential goods and services like buying groceries, cutting hair or doing laundry To exercise alone or with others you live with in green or open spaces To seek medical help for suspected COVID-19 infection or other urgent treatment To provide assistance to seniors (60 years and above) or persons with disability To seek or render help in an emergency To comply with the law (eg. court order) To report for National Service To move house To leave Singapore*Whenever you leave the house, you must keep a distance of at least one metre from others, with the exception of lifts, vehicles and public transport-related premises.Q: When can I enter another person’s house?A: You may only go into another person’s house to: Deliver essential goods or services Provide assistance to a senior (60 years old and above) or a person with disability Seek or render help in an emergencyQ: What is considered an essential service?A: Essential services include those involved in the provision of food, health and social services, transportation, and activities of daily living e.g. haircuts. The full list of essential services can be found here.Q:Should I wear a mask when I go out?A: Essential service workers who come into frequent contact with members of the public (e.g. food handlers/hawkers/food delivery staff) should wear a mask. For everyone else, stay home unless absolutely necessary to go out, in which case, you should also wear a mask when you are unavoidably in situations where you come into closer proximity with other people, such as at wet markets, supermarkets or public transport).For the general public, you are advised to stay home and avoid interactions with anyone other than immediate family members living in the same household. For those who need to go out, and are unable to avoid close contact with others, then wearing a mask could provide some basic protection for others, and yourself.Home, Family and FriendsQ:I have a weekly get-together (e.g. high tea, mahjong, movie screening) with my close group of friends. Can we continue with that?A: No. All social gatherings, such as private parties and social get-togethers with friends and relatives and family members not within the same household, should stop during this period. This is to prevent the spread of COVID-19 through such social interactions.Q: Some of my elderly family members need help with daily needs. Can I still visit them?A:Yes, where necessary, individuals can still visit elderly family members to assist with their daily needs. Please take the necessary safe distancing precautions while you are there, such as observing personal hygiene and ensuring your hands are clean, minimising physical contact and maintaining a safe separation as much as possible. Do not visit if you are unwell.Where possible, we strongly recommend for family members to support their elderly relatives who do not stay with them by keeping in contact through phone or video calls, or bringing them groceries, food and other essential supplies to assist with their daily needs. This is to avoid seniors having to make trips out of the home for such activities.Q: Are we allowed to go to the houses of our extended family for caregiving purposes (e.g., grandparents going to children’s house to care for grandchildren)?A: The objective of the circuit breaker measures is to significantly reduce movements and social interactions, especially for seniors who are more vulnerable to COVID-19 infection.Grandparents can continue to care for their grandchildren if the grandchildren stay with them throughout this period. We strongly urge seniors to stay at home and avoid going out. You should not drop off your children with their grandparents on a daily basis as this increases the risk of transmission. However, exemptions can be made if you belong to one of the following groups:a. Both parents are essential service workers and unable to work from home;b. One parent is a healthcare professional (e.g. doctor, nurse, allied health professional, support care staff) and is unable to work from home; andc. One parent is an essential service worker who is unable to work from home, and have a child/children below the age of three.Social gatherings, such as private parties and social get-togethers with friends and relatives and family members not within the same household, are disallowed.Q: Can I still accompany my elderly parent living in a different household to medical appointments? A: Yes, you can continue to accompany your elderly parent to medical appointments but please take additional precautions such as wearing a mask and ensuring good personal hygiene while you are in contact with him or her.Q:Can I still check on my neighbour who is a senior? She is living alone with no kin, and usually comes to our house for dinner.A: Yes, you may continue to provide assistance to her for her daily needs, but unless absolutely necessary, this should not be done with physical interaction. If you have any physical interaction, please take the necessary safe distancing precautions, such as observing personal hygiene and ensuring your hands are clean, minimising physical contact and maintaining a safe separation as much as possible. Do not visit if you are unwell.If you know of a senior e.g. neighbour, friend, family member, who needs assistance with their daily needs, please contact the AIC hotline at 1800-650-6060.Q: Can I call a repairman to come to my house to fix water pipes/electricity/cable/aircon issues?A: Yes if these are for emergency household services. Please observe safe distancing measures while the repair staff is at your house.Other essential services permitted are plumbers, electricians, locksmiths, repair of consumer electronics/ IT peripherals/household appliances, and healthcare and veterinary services.SchoolQ: Can I continue private face-to-face home tuition for my child?A: No. You should limit social contact to individuals living in the same household. Private tutors must suspend all face-to-face lessons.RecreationQ: Can I continue to exercise or engage in recreation activities?A: You may still exercise, on your own or with members of your household, around your immediate neighbourhood in open, uncrowded places. Greens and open spaces will remain open, but gatherings in groups in these places must be avoided. Safe distancing measures must be observed at all times.Members of public are also advised to return to their homes promptly and do not linger.If you do not comply with these rules, you will be fined an amount not exceeding $10,000, and/jailed for not more than six months. If you violate these rules twice or more times, penalties will be doubled.Please take safe distancing seriously.

       " {'text': 'containing covid 19 spread at foreign worker dormitories Watch video in English| Bengali |Chinese | Malay | Tamil Excerpt from PM Lee’s address to nation on 10 Apr 2020We have seen outbreaks in several foreign worker dormitories. Many dorms have cases, and some dorms have many cases. We have responded comprehensively to contain the spread in the dorms, and to protect the foreign workers.Yesterday, Ministers Lawrence Wong and Gan Kim Yong explained what we are doing. They have set up an interagency task force to handle the situation in the dorms. Ministry of Health, Ministry of Manpower, the SAF, the Home Team, all are involved. The commander of the task force is the Chief Guards Officer from the Army, and Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean is advising the ministers on this issue.The task force has deployed Forward Assurance and Support Teams in all the dorms. These teams work closely with the dorm operators and can respond quickly to the workers’ essential needs. They are setting up medical facilities and triage clinics, bringing in supplies and food, and managing the logistics and housekeeping. They are making sure the workers have food and water, and WiFi to keep in touch with families back home and friends here, and for entertainment. The SAF and the Home Team have the resources and the organisation to do this. Many other public service agencies are also chipping in.We are paying close attention to the welfare of the foreign workers. They came to Singapore to work hard for a living, and provide for their families back home. They have played an important part building our HDB flats, Changi Airport, MRT lines. We have worked with their employers to make sure they will be paid their salaries, and can remit money home. We will provide them with the medical care and treatment that they need. Containment of spreadAs of 13 April 2020, Acacia Lodge, Cochrane Lodge I, Cochrane Lodge II, Tampines Dormitory, Sungei Tengah Lodge, Toh Guan Dormitory, S11 Dormitory @ Punggol (\"S11\") and Westlite (Toh Guan) Dormitory have been gazetted as isolation areas due to a large number of COVID-19 cases.Workers who are symptomatic have already been isolated.Protecting Foreign Workers who are wellAll foreign workers in the affected dorms will not go to work.Access to recreational facilities will be regulated to reduce the inter-mixing. They will also not be allowed to move between blocks.Workers have also been advised not to interact with others who do not reside in the same room or floor.All resident workers have received care packs consisting of masks, thermometers and hand sanitisers.All affected workers will be taken care ofMOM is working closely with the dorm operators to ensure that the affected workers will be taken care of: Salaries - they will continue to be paid salaries for the duration of the quarantine. The period of absence from work will be treated as paid hospitalisation leave. To provide relief to employers, the government will waive levies due in April and provide a one-off levy rebate of $750 to employers. In view of this support, employers of foreign work permit and S Pass holders will not be eligible for the daily allowance paid to employers of quarantined workers. This supersedes the Government’s earlier statement regarding the daily quarantine allowance. Daily needs will be provided – three meals a day by professional caterers, reusable masks, thermometers, hand sanitisers, and other essentials. Medical - Onsite medical support has been deployed to support the workers in both dormitories.Enhanced health screening measures are also in place, with temperature checking and regular monitoring for fever and respiratory symptoms. Those who are unwell will be provided with prompt medical treatment.Enhanced waste management and sanitation regimesCleaning of dorms has been intensified. The frequency of refuse collection and removal from the premises for disposal have been increased from once a day to three to five times daily, depending on the premises.The disinfection and cleaning of the common areas and washroom facilities are also carried out on an average of three times per day.As this will be a big adjustment for the affected workers, MOM will ensure that those who are affected will be provided the necessary support.Read more: Additional measures to minimise further spread of COVID-19 within foreign worker dormitories (5 Apr 2020) Efforts to ensure well-being of foreign workers at S11 Dormitory @ Punggol and Westlite Toh Guan (6 Apr 2020) Inter-Agency Taskforce to support foreign workers and dormitory operators during circuit breaker period (7 Apr 2020) Update on Conditions at Three Dormitories Gazetted as Isolation Areas (8 Apr 2020) Further improvements in distribution process and quality of food for dormitories gazetted as isolation areas (9 Apr 2020) Enhanced cleanliness and sanitation measures at dormitories gazetted as isolation areas (10 Apr 2020) Food distribution, cleanliness and hygiene standards at Sungei Tengah Lodge and Tampines Dormitory stabilised within 48 hours (11 Apr 2020) Key actions to manage transmission of COVID-19 in all dormitories (14 Apr 2020)Resources for dorm operators and workersWatch video in other languagesEnglish |Bengali | Chinese | Tamil #link-blue { color: #105cb6; } Workers at Dormitories English: PDF / JPEG Chinese: PDF / JPEG Bengali: PDF / JPEG Tamil: PDF / JPEG', 'id': 'fe51bc93-afbb-4131-bd03-1f78e27010ab', 'score': None, 'probability': None, 'question': None, 'meta': {'category': 'articles'}, 'embedding': None},\n",

A Sunday service at another church in Paya Lebar more than a week earlier. A Chinese New Year gathering at Mei Hwan Drive in Serangoon.Three seemingly unrelated events that bore no apparent link to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases here, much less to each other.But with expert contact tracing by the Ministry of Health (MOH) and the Singapore Police Force (SPF), coupled with a world’s first laboratory test, the mystery link between one of the largest COVID-19 cluster here and travellers from Wuhan was finally found.Case 66 – the primary case at Grace Assembly of GodCase 66, a 28 year-old Singaporean male with no travel history to China, works at the Grace Assembly of God as a church staff.He had reported the onset of symptoms on 29 January– the earliest in the cluster– and had gone to work at the church's Tanglin branch while symptomatic.Sixteen members and staff of the church were subsequently infected with the virus – initially through a staff meeting he attended, and subsequently through various church activities.Through detailed epidemiological investigation and assistance from the SPF, MOH determined that Case 66 was the primary case of the cluster at Grace Assembly of God.But how did Case 66 first contract the virus?CNY gathering at Mei Hwan DriveOn 12 February, Case 66 was referred to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID). He was confirmed to have COVID-19 infection two days later.Upon further investigation, MOH found that he had attended a Chinese New Year (CNY) gathering at Mei Hwan Drive on the first day of CNY, 25 January.Among the attendees were Cases 83 and 91, a married couple.When contacted by the contact tracing team, both Cases 83 and 91 were, however, not sick; they had no symptoms of COVID-19.Cases 83 and 91 – the missing linkChecking through their records, MOH found that Case 91 had actually gone to Sengkang General Hospital’s emergency department on 26 January with COVID-19-like symptoms. Based on the case definitions at that time, she was not identified as a suspect case.Her husband, Case 83, had also been unwell in end-January, and had sought treatment several times at a general practitioner clinic.MOH’s investigations had also earlier uncovered that both Cases 83 and 91 were at The Life Church and Missions Singapore on 19 January – the same day Cases 8 and 9, two Chinese nationals from Wuhan, had visited the church.MOH were now presented with a possible link between Wuhan (Cases 8 and 9), The Life Church and Missions Singapore cluster (through Cases 83 and 91), and the Grace Assembly of God cluster (through Case 66).Cases 83 and 91 likely got infected from Cases 8 and 9, and had then passed the infection to Case 66 at the CNY gathering, who subsequently passed to his colleagues at Grace Assembly of God.Establishing a positive link despite COVID-19 negativeMOH arranged for Cases 83 and 91 to be tested at NCID. However, as both were already well, the current test to confirm COVID-19 infection would not work.This is because the lab test, called Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), detects whether viral genetic material (COVID-19 in this case) is present in a patient’s biological sample. When a patient has recovered and his immune system cleared of the virus, the test would return negative.However, knowing that the immune system produces antibodies in response to the infection – which can stay with the recovered patient for several years – MOH decided to test them with a new type of test, known as the serological test.Serological testing – a world’s firstIn came the research team at Duke-NUS Medical School, who had earlier successfully cultured the COVID-19 virus shortly after Singapore confirmed its first case. The team had then rapidly developed several laboratory tests to detect the virus-specific antibodies for contact tracing, among other applications.Using two different antibody testing platforms (virus neutralisation assay and ELISA assay), they were able to confirm that Cases 83 and 91 had high levels of antibodies that were specific to COVID-19.This meant that both cases had indeed been infected with COVID-19 in late-January, even though they had since recovered.This was a significant piece of evidence, as it definitively established the links between the two church clusters, the CNY family gathering, and the travellers from Wuhan.Close collaboration between agenciesThis significant breakthrough was made possible through the close collaboration between MOH’s contact tracing and epidemiological teams, SPF, as well as the researchers at Duke-NUS Medical School.MOH and SPF had extensively analysed the activity maps of the confirmed cases, interviewed them as well as their close contacts, in order to establish a detailed map of possible transmission across the different cases.Duke-NUS researchers’ quick response then provided the confirmation needed to connect the clusters together.With the discovery of the links between the two church clusters to the travellers from Wuhan, MOH has now determined the likely source of infection for a large majority of the locally-transmitted cases.\", 'id': '1b475d8b-3a34-4432-a054-771fb9a1dff2', 'score': None, 'probability': None, 'question': None, 'meta': {'category': 'articles'}, 'embedding': None},\n",

Expansion of community testing MOH will expand its testing strategy to test more extensively among key population groups in the community: Close contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the community, at the start and end of their quarantine period Vulnerable or higher-risk groups in community, this includes the recent testing of staff and residents of MOH and Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) residential homes serving the elderly, and all preschool staff Incoming travellers before the end of their Stay-Home Notice periodAll individuals aged 13 and above who are diagnosed with acute respiratory infection (ARI) at first presentation to a doctor will now be tested for COVID-19 from 1 July onwards. This is an expansion from the current testing of all individuals aged 45 and above who are diagnosed with ARI. As clinical and scientific evidence shows that an infected person is most infectious right before and immediately after the start of symptoms, this expanded testing strategy allows MOH to detect infected individuals early and to quickly contain further spread.Singapore will also conduct more active and targeted surveillance testing in the community where needed eg. testing target groups such as frontline staff interacting with travellers as we open our borders.Supporting Public Health Preparedness Clinics In the last few months, more than 900 Public Health Preparedness Clinics (PHPCs) provided subsidised consultation and treatment for Singaporeans, Permanent Residents and eligible Work Permit holders diagnosed with respiratory infections. More than 450,000 patients have benefitted from subsidies for treatment of respiratory infections at PHPCs and polyclinics, with around $31 million in subsidies disbursed to date.MOH will provide a one-off $10,000 COVID-19 grant to each PHPC in recognition of the role PHPCs play in combatting COVID-19. MOH will also provide a one-time start-up grant of $1,200 in recognition of the costs and efforts PHPCs incurred in supporting the national COVID-19 testing effort and to encourage more PHPCs to join the Swab and Send Home Programme. In addition, an Assurance Grant will also be provided to support PHPCs whose doctors contract COVID-19 or are placed on Quarantine Order as a result of their providing care to their patients.Progress in DormitoriesUp to 10,000 tests, including individual swabs, pooled swabs and serological testing, are administered daily for migrant workers.The Inter-agency Taskforce strives to clear all the dormitories in the most expedient and efficient way possible, while safeguarding the health of residents. Dormitories are prioritised based on their readiness for testing, which depends on factors including: Prevalence of infection Length of time since the onset of infection Adherence to safe distancingAs of 23 June 2020, about 120,000 workers have either recovered or have been tested to be free from the virus. Amongst the population, 80,000 are able to resume work while the rest are pending movement to appropriate accommodations before they start work. By the end of July, we expect that 80% of workers staying in the dormitories would have recovered or cleared through testing protocols.Working together for a safe transitionThe expansion of testing in the community, supported by Singapore’s healthcare networks, will help enhance disease survelliance, detect the virus early and reduce the risk of further transmission. The dormitory clearance strategy would also provide for safe return of migrant workers to the workforce. Coupled with the use of technology with TraceTogether and SafeEntry to expand contact tracing capability, these are all efforts to manage COVID-19 in Phase Two. Nonetheless, the risk of infection and spread remains and it is crucial for everyone to remain alert and follow safe management and safe distancing measures.

       " {'text': 'can i wear a face shield instead of a mask [Updated as of 29 Aug 2020]With the re-opening of Singapore’s economy and society, more activities and close contact amongst people, including on public transport, are to be expected. In light of this, a distinction will be made between use of face shields and masks.This will be a change from during the circuit breaker, when face shields were allowed to be worn in place of masks.Masks are now the defaultFrom 2 Jun 2020 onwards, all must continue to wear masks outside their homes. The use of masks that closely and completely cover the nose and mouth will be required as a default.Why so?COVID-19 is spread predominantly through droplets. The design of face shields typically leaves a gap between the face shield and the face. Masks that are worn closely and completely over the nose and mouth do not have such gaps.Face shields allowed only for specific exempt groups or settingsIn some situations where the wearing of masks may not be practical, face shields may be worn. They must be worn properly so that a face shield covers the entire face, from the forehead to below the chin, wrapping around the sides of the face.Groups that can wear a face shield: Children twelve years and below, who may have difficulty wearing and keeping face masks on for a prolonged period of time; Persons with health conditions that may result in breathing or other medical difficulties when a mask is worn for a prolonged period of time; and Persons who are speaking to a group in a classroom or lecture-style setting, where they largely remain at the spot from which they are speaking, and are able to maintain a safe distance away from any other persons.Situations that are exempt:Currently, persons doing television broadcasts are exempted from having to wear face masks or face shields. This exemption will continue, provided that such activities are done in a safe and controlled environment.Face shields may be worn on top of masksIn certain settings, face shields may be worn on top of a mask to provide additional protection. Wearing a shield can help to protect one’s eyes from droplets that may contain virus particles, and can also prevent the mask from getting wet. Wearing a face shield may also help prevent people from adjusting their masks or touching their faces.Makeshift coverings should not be usedThere have been recent queries on the efficacy of makeshift coverings such as bandanas, scarves, and neck gaiters in preventing disease transmission. As these makeshift coverings may not have a good fit around the person’s nose and mouth and are made from materials that are not specific for disease prevention, they may not perform as well as purpose-built masks.To ensure transmission rates in the community are kept low, it is critical for every member of public to put on masks that are designed or made specifically to prevent disease transmission. A mask should be worn such that it closely and completely covers the wearer’s nose and mouth, without leaving a gap between the mask and the face. Therefore, face coverings such as neck gaiters, bandanas, scarves, or handkerchiefs should not be used.Continue to stay home, stay safeAll are still advised to stay at home and avoid going out where possible.Those who need to go out should continue to wear masks and take preventive measures such as hand hygiene and safe distancing to help reduce and prevent the spread of COVID-19.Flexibility in enforcement will continue for groups that may have difficulties wearing a face mask or shield. These include children with special needs and young children aged two and above. In particular, mask-wearing is not recommended for young children below the age of two for safety reasons.As more activities and services gradually resume, all should play their part by wearing masks, observing good personal hygiene, and adhering to safe distancing and safe management measures.Read more on the guidance for uses of masks and face shields here.Read more on the guidance for makeshift coverings here.', 'id': 'e8568fdd-681b-4924-9e30-796e419385f0', 'score': None, 'probability': None, 'question': None, 'meta': {'category': 'articles'}, 'embedding': None},\n",

Temperature-taking is conducted daily and schools are also looking out for other flu-like symptoms, and will suggest to students/staff to see a doctor.Rest at home until you recoverEven if you have mild symptoms, stay at home and rest. Doctors have been given guidance to provide medical certificates (MCs) of five days for patients with respiratory symptoms so they can stay home and recover. Individuals and employers are urged to cooperate and follow strictly the five-day MC regime.Wear a mask if you’re sickYou should wear a mask if you have a fever, cough or runny nose, or if you are recovering from an illness.

       " {'text': 'the science behind why masks help prevent covid 19 spread Using laser beams and a high-speed, high-sensitivity camera to “see” the tiny droplets which are produced when we cough, it can be seen that when a mask is properly worn, little or no droplets are released into the atmosphere.The experiment was conducted by scientists from the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) and in consultation with doctors from the Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Infectious Diseases and Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, to test the effectiveness of masks in reducing the spread of respiratory droplets.Executive Director Professor Alfred Huan, and Principal Scientist and Director of Strategic Research Office Assoc Prof Loh Xian Jun, from A*STAR’s Institute of Materials Research and Engineering (IMRE), led the experiment, which was carried out in a dark room, and in which the area outside of the subject was lighted up with parabolic mirrors.What can our scientists deduce based on their findings? When people are sick and cough or sneeze without wearing a mask, the droplets they produce which contain viruses can travel 2-3m away. If these droplets land on someone else’s face, or a surface which is touched by someone else, it may make the person sick. Heavier, larger droplets drop to the ground while the smaller droplets appear to drift in the air Other environmental factors like humidity, temperature and even wind speed would also affect how the droplets travel.But when any type of mask is properly worn over the nose and mouth, most if not all droplets are blocked from getting out into the air or landing on someone else.That is why it is critical for people to wear masks to stop the spread of COVID-19, especially given the possibility that there are people who have the coronavirus in their bodies and can spread it, but are not showing any symptoms. One of the doctors involved in the experiment, Professor Tan Ban Hock, Senior Consultant at the Department of Infectious Diseases, Singapore General Hospital, said, “Wearing a mask is therefore important, as it serves as a mechanical barrier to the dispersion of droplets.”Masks lose effectiveness if not worn properlyThe experiment also showed that the mask must be worn properly. Minute droplets escape if the mask does not cover the nose.Prof Huan stated, “When the mask only covers the mouth and not the nose, some droplets are ejected into the air due to the loose fit. The efficacy of the mask in curbing the spread of droplets is dependent on how the mask is worn.”While the team did not investigate the effectiveness of different types of masks, Assoc Prof Loh stated, “A simple cloth mask is effective in curbing the spread of droplets from inside-out. That is, it protects those around the person coughing.”', 'id': '822d753b-be07-4573-b451-97b206e3096d', 'score': None, 'probability': None, 'question': None, 'meta': {'category': 'articles'}, 'embedding': None},\n",

Answer: Take safe d i s t a n c i n g seriously.The idea is simple – to maintain a distance between yourself and others and minimise physical interactions. By doing so and reducing gathering in close proximitywith crowds, we can slow down the transmission chain and flatten the epidemic curve. This is the best way to contain and prevent community spread as it can serve as a circuit breaker.The WHO has advised to maintain at least one metre distance between yourself and anyone who is sneezing and coughing. That’s because when someone coughs or sneezes, they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain the virus.In your day to day No more handshakes – try an elbow bump, an air five or any other preferred way of greeting, as long as it is contactless.

       " {'text': \"sciencetalk vaccination is key to singapores fight against covid 19 Read 3 articles daily and stand to win ST rewards, including the ST News Tablet worth $398. Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - In recent weeks, Singapore has witnessed a steady and significant increase in the number of Covid-19 cases within the community. Clusters have emerged in variouslocations including hospitals, Changi Airport and a tuition enrichment centre. In response, the Government has imposed further restrictions on social activities, with dining in prohibited and social gatherings capped at two people till at least the middle of next month. Many are experiencing an unsettling sense of deja vu: We appear to be in exactly the same position as we were a year ago. It is very likely that Covid-19 is here to stay for the foreseeable future, as Sars-CoV-2,the virus which causes Covid-19,has become firmly entrenched in humans. This means we will sporadically see community Covid-19 cases. Yet, there is a striking difference between now and last year: We now have access to safe and highly effective vaccines which can not only reduce the risk of severe Covid-19 and death, but also lower the risk of transmission. Even as Singapore tries to contain the spread of the virus in the community by limiting social activities and interactions, the recent spike in Covid-19 cases underscores the importance for as many of us as possible to be vaccinated. Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines - the two vaccines currently licensed for emergency use in Singapore - have proven to be more than 95 per cent effective in preventing both symptomatic and severe disease, based on data from clinical trials and real-world experiences in Israel, the United Kingdom and several states in the United States where vaccination rates are high. Surveillance data from Israel also showed vaccination reduces the rate of all infections, whether asymptomatic or symptomatic. While more studies will be needed to confirm the effectiveness of these vaccines against new variants, we have seen promising data emerge. For example, a high level of vaccine effectiveness was seen in Israel against the B117 variant, the variant first detected in the UK. Likewise, the mRNA vaccine was 94 per cent effective in preventing Covid-19 caused by the new R1 variant among nursing home residents in the US. Pre-review data from the UK also suggests that mRNA and other vaccines remain effective against the latest variant of concern, B1617, which was first detected in India. The population level observations on immunity against the variants are backed by the fact that mRNA vaccines trigger the development of antibodies against Sars-CoV-2, as well as T cells that recognise infected cells and kill them to limit the spread of virus in our airway. Hence, even if antibodies cannot fully block infection caused by the viral variants, the T cells produced by vaccination would still be effective in limiting the extent of infection to result in mild or no illness. Like many other vaccines that are currently in use, the mRNA Covid-19 vaccines are not 100 per cent effective. However, it is noteworthy that many of these breakthrough infections were picked up as a result of routine swabbing, and not because these individuals were ill. This shows that vaccines do reduce the severity of Covid-19 and it is thus clear that vaccination can prevent people from contracting what could otherwise be a life-threatening disease. The ripple effect of vaccination stretches well beyond the benefit to the individual, as a reduction in severe Covid-19 cases would mitigate the threat of our healthcare system being overwhelmed by patients requiring critical care and ventilatory support, as we have observed recently in countries like India. Vaccination also reduces Sars-CoV-2 transmission. There is now increasing evidence to suggest that although vaccinated individuals may carry the virus in their nasal passages, the chance of spreading the infection to others is very low. In the UK, pre-review data suggests that vaccination, even after only a single dose, reduces transmission by a third to unvaccinated household members; this rate is halved in those who have completed two doses. Even if such vaccinated individuals were to be infectious, the amount of virus shed by them has been recently found to be much lower than those from unvaccinated cases. Moreover, the duration of infectivity is also likely far shorter than those of unvaccinated cases. Finally, a person who is asymptomatic and not sneezing or coughing is also less likely to transmit the infection to others. When we get vaccinated, we protect ourselves, our families and our country. Since last December, when Singapore rolled out its Covid-19 vaccination programme in staggered phases, approximately 2.2 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines have been administered, with just over one-third of the population receiving at least one dose. Compared with places that have begun to see the benefit of vaccination - namely Israel, the UK and some parts of the US where the population vaccinated with at least one dose has exceeded 50 per cent - Singapore's percentage is still too low for vaccines to make a significant impact on preventing outbreaks of Covid-19. Besides the initial decision by the Government to vaccinate its population at a measured pace, another reason for the relatively slow roll-out has been due to limitations in supply, compounded by the need for two doses as part of a complete regimen. To overcome this problem, the Ministry of Health will now delay administration of the second dose to six to eight weeks after the first dose, in order to allow greater vaccine coverage. Such a strategy is not unprecedented and has been employed successfully in places such as the UK. Recent published data from Scotland has shown that mass roll-out of the first dose of the vaccine resulted in a significant reduction in Covid-19-related hospitalisations; single-dose vaccine efficacy ranged from 70 per cent to 90 per cent. The US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention estimate the efficacy after a single dose of mRNA vaccine to be 80 per cent. Delaying the second dose may also produce a stronger immune response to vaccination. New evidence from Public Health England shows that older individuals who received a delayed second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine at 12 weeks had 3½times more antibodies compared with those who received their second dose after three weeks. While a second dose may still be necessary to extend the longevity of immunity against Covid-19, a greater coverage of the population with a single dose of the vaccine would slow virus transmission, prevent large clusters of cases, and reduce severe Covid-19 cases and deaths. Complete elimination of Sars-CoV-2 is now an unrealistic expectation. Covid-19 will be a part of our lives in the foreseeable future. But with increased vaccine coverage, we can minimise the impact Covid-19 will have. We can turn what is otherwise a life-threatening condition into nothing more than a flu-like illness. We can expect a gradual return to our normal way of life. Israel, with 60 per cent of its population vaccinated, has done away with masks. As scientific understanding of Sars-CoV-2 and vaccines continues to improve with time, more discoveries will also be made to address other urgent questions, such as the longevity of immunity against Covid-19, Sars-CoV-2 evolution and the need for booster vaccination. These will add to our arsenal in the battle against Covid-19. To paraphrase the ancient Chinese general and military strategist Sun Tzu: If we know the enemy (Sars-CoV-2) and ourselves (our immune system), we need not fear the battles we will fight with this virus. • Professor Ooi Eng Eong, Professor Antonio Bertoletti and Assistant Professor Shirin Kalimuddin are researchers in the Emerging Infectious Diseases Programme at Duke-NUS Medical School.

       " {'text': 'ring fencing intensified to avoid a second circuit breaker Read 3 articles daily and stand to win ST rewards, including the ST News Tablet worth $398. Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - Ring-fencing strategies that aim to limit Covid-19 transmissions and contain their spread have been intensified recently, helping Singapore stave off a second circuit breaker for now. Experts note that larger areas are now being closed off and more people made to undergo swab testing. Professor Teo Yik Ying, dean of the National University of Singapore\\'s (NUS) Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, said that ring-fencing can help to flatten the curve of infections by preventing transmissions from spilling over to other sectors. \"It is a form of sectoral lockdown so that all the people within a location or sector can minimise further interactions with the public,\" he said, adding that it allows the authorities to understand the extent of the outbreak in that area. However, it has to be executed promptly upon the discovery of cases, said Prof Teo, though the speed of execution is relative to how fast transmissions can occur. \"This depends on the extent of human-to-human interactions, personal safe management measures and the characteristics of the coronavirus infection, such as whether infected cases have high viral loads,\" he said. Ring-fencing was used in 2003 amid the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak, with close contacts of patients quarantined at home. More recently, the approach was used in Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) with some success. When a 46-year-old nurse followed by a few patients in Ward 9D were diagnosed with Covid-19, the hospital moved quickly to close the ward. It expanded the ring fence when it emerged that there was potential exposure to these confirmed cases in other parts of the hospital. By April 30, three days after the first infection was reported, the hospital had locked down four wards. On May 4, it stopped admitting new patients. All close contacts were placed on quarantine, with TTSH staff and patients in the affected areas tested. There was also increased clinical surveillance of all patients who developed fever and acute respiratory infection symptoms, and deep cleaning was conducted. Close to 28,000 people were tested for Covid-19, including 12,000 TTSH staff and 1,000 patients, as well as close to 2,500 individuals who were quarantined following contact tracing. Contact tracing, mandatory testing and deep cleaning are carried out for areas that are ring-fenced, followed by monitoring and heightened vigilance, said Professor Josip Car, director of the Centre for Population Health Science at Nanyang Technological University\\'s Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine But he noted that Singapore\\'s ring-fencing strategy has been tweaked since last year. \"The areas being ring-fenced are now bigger for each potential outbreak. For instance, last year, outbreaks in schools first started with classes or levels being ring-fenced, but this year, the response is swifter and wider,\" he said. Last July, then Education Minister Ong Ye Kung said his ministry\\'s approach was to ring-fence schools on a small scale, and to put students and staff on leave of absence instead of fully closing schools. The approach was to close a class to keep the school safe and, if need be, the school. But amid the current surge which has seen more children across several schools infected this year than last year, the ministry moved schools to home-based learning from May 19 to May 28. On Friday night, the Education Ministry reported the first case of school-based transmission - a second student of Anglo-Chinese School (Junior) had tested positive for Covid-19, after his classmate had done so on May 19. When multiple areas are concurrently affected, Prof Car said broader measures covering larger areas may be needed to stem or slow the spread. This would also require the co-operation of those who were potentially exposed to the virus to go for testing, and to see a doctor if they develop any symptoms, he added. Take White Sands shopping mall, which was listed 14 times on the Health Ministry\\'s list of locations visited by Covid-19 community cases during their infectious period. The authorities moved to get people who visited the mall from May 2 to May 11 tested. Through the TraceTogether app and token, close contacts were identified and notified by SMS. However, a more aggressive approach was taken for residents of Block 506 Hougang Avenue 8, after a number of residents there tested positive. For the first time, it was made mandatory for all 116 households to get tested. Prof Car said that in scenarios of limited transmissions, locking down areas not exposed to the source of the virus could overstretch resources and may not be more effective than ring-fencing in breaking the chain of transmissions. \"Whole-country lockdowns may be necessary, but only in the event of many localised outbreaks or uncontrolled spread where contact tracing resources are overstretched,\" he said, adding that Singapore has been following this playbook and extending the ring-fence outwards when needed. As at Sunday, Singapore has had over 90 unlinked local Covid-19 cases reported since May 7, compared with a total of 68 unlinked cases reported from the start of the year till before the spike. Associate Professor Hsu Li Yang, an infectious diseases expert from the NUS Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, said: \"If unlinked cases start appearing in the majority of sectors in the economy, it will probably trigger a more general lockdown.\" Agreeing, Prof Car said that these unlinked cases signal leakages from containment areas, and could be a result of higher infectivity of the new viral strain, rather than the non-effectiveness of the localised ring-fencing strategy. Prof Teo said: \"If the pace and scale of the spillover is so great that the contact tracing and ring-fencing are basically trying to play catch-up, then a complete lockdown becomes the only viable option to arrest the growth of the outbreak in the community.\" Join ST\\'s Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - Singapore economy grew at a much faster pace in the first quarter of this year, running past earlier estimates by both the Government and most analysts. The final estimate for first-quarter growth came at 1.3 per cent on a yearly basis, compared with an earlier gross domestic product (GDP) estimate of a 0.2 per cent rise and the 2.4 per cent contraction recorded in the previous quarter, the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) said on Tuesday (May 25). The January-March expansion was even higher than the 0.9 per cent growth projected by economists in a Reuters poll. The surprisingly strong performance in the first quarter and confidence over robust demand for exports are likely to balance the risk from the recent tightening of domestic restrictions and border controls, Hence, Singapore maintained its economic growth forecast range for this year at 4 per cent to 6 per cent, MTI said in a statement. The full-year forecast will be reviewed again in August, when there is more data and greater clarity over the global and domestic economic situations, it said. Analysts said the first-quarter performance would have called for an upgrade of the official forecast. However, a recent Covid-19 upsurge at home and abroad have tempered such expectations. MTI said uncertainties have increased and are characterised by both upside and downside risks, especially arising from the coronavirus pandemic at home and abroad. Earlier this month, Singapore tightened its safety measures to contain a surprise surge in local community Covid-19 cases. The phase two (heightened alert) restrictions that will remain in effect until mid-June have raised concerns over the full-year growth target. Mr Gabriel Lim, MTI’s permanent secretary, said that the external economic environment has improved since February, mainly due to upgrades in the growth outlook for advanced economies like the United States. “At the same time, however, the pandemic continues to disrupt activities in many economies, threatening to undermine any recovery,” he said at a media briefing after the release of the first quarter Economic Survey report. Mr Lim noted that while the recent tightening of domestic restrictions and border controls represents a setback to segments of the Singapore economy, the broader economy should still see a recovery this year in tandem with the global economic rebound and further progress in the domestic vaccination programme. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted basis, the economy grew by 3.1 per cent during the first three months of this year, extending the 3.8 per cent expansion in the fourth quarter of last year. The first quarter growth came on the back of the manufacturing sector’s 10.7 per cent year-on-year expansion, faster than the 10.3 per cent growth recorded in the previous quarter. MTI said the Jan-March growth was due to output expansions in the electronics, precision engineering and chemicals clusters, which outweighed output declines in transport engineering, general manufacturing and biomedical manufacturing. The wholesale trade sector expanded by 3.5 per cent year on year, faster than the 1.8 per cent growth registered in the previous quarter, and the retail trade sector grew by 1.4 per cent. Growth of the information and communications sector accelerated to 6.4 per cent year on year, from the 2.6 per cent achieved in the previous quarter. However, the construction sector contracted by 22.7 per cent and the transportation and storage sector shrank by 16.5 per cent, compared with the same period last year. The food and beverage service sector contracted by 9.4 per cent year on year. MTI said that while it is still possible that the Singapore economy will outperform the 4 per cent to 6 per cent growth forecast for this year, there are also significant downside risks, with the most important being the trajectory of the pandemic. “Countries are experiencing recurring waves of infections, with the emergence of more transmissible strains of the virus, the easing of safe management restrictions and delays in vaccinating populations,” MTI said. The ministry said these resurgences, as well as the countries’ public health responses to them, will inevitably affect their economic growth. As these countries include some of Singapore’s major economic partners, the uncertainty in their outlook will also affect the Republic. Mr Lim said the experience of the last 15 months shows there is hope that even if outbreaks flare up again, countries will be able to avoid repeated blanket lockdowns and their high economic cost. He added: “Taking into account the above factors, and considering the larger-than-usual degree of uncertainty over the course of the pandemic globally as well as our domestic situation, MTI has decided to maintain the GDP growth forecast for 2021 at 4 per cent to 6 per cent for now.” Mr Irvin Seah, senior economist at DBS Bank, said he would stick to his full year forecast of 6.3 per cent as the stronger than expected first quarter will help to partially offset the potential decline in April-June period. Ms Selena Ling, OCBC Bank’s chief economist and head of treasury research and strategy, said the 4 per cent floor in the MTI forecast was quite conservative to start with given the depth of last year’s recession - a record 5.4 per cent contraction. For the rest of the year the growth trajectory will depend on whether the Covid situation and tightening measures get prolonged into the third quarter, both for the region and domestic economies, as well as whether manufacturing as the growth driver continues to sustain. However, some analysts who had been more bullish did lower their projections. Mr Sin Beng Ong, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase Bank, said he has revised down Singapore’s full-year 2021 GDP growth to 7 per cent from an earlier estimate of 7.8 per cent. “The revisions are due to the tightening of stringency measures following a rise in Covid-19 cases, with its impact on the non-tradable sectors even as resilience in the manufacturing sector remains,” he said.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - Free Covid-19 testing will be extended to those who visited Jem and Westgate between May 10 and last Saturday, after a cluster linked to the malls grew to 50 cases. Six new cases linked to the cluster were among the 24 community cases confirmed on Monday (May 24) evening. Meanwhile, a 15-year-old Peicai Secondary student and a 16-year-old Greendale Secondary student - who work part-time at Pizza Hut at Punggol Plaza - are among five cases that have been added to the McDonald\\'s delivery riders cluster. The cluster was first confirmed last Saturday. A 53-year-old cleaner who works at Park Avenue Rochester, a stay-home notice dedicated facility, may have been the source of infection for the Westgate and Jem cluster when she visited Westgate on May 6, investigations by the Ministry of Health (MOH) suggest. The cleaner was previously confirmed to have the virus on May 7. \"Whole genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis conducted by the National Public Health Laboratory have revealed that some of the visitors to Jemand Westgate have similar sequences to (the cleaner),\" MOH said on Monday. \"Further investigations into the mode of transmission are ongoing.\" All visitors to Jem and Westgate since May 10 are also advised to monitor their health closely for 14 days from their date of visit. They are encouraged to visit a regional screening centre or Swab and Send HomePublic Health Preparedness Clinic for a free Covid-19 test if they feel unwell. The six new community cases reported on Monday linked to the Westgate and Jem cluster means it is now the second-biggest active cluster after the Changi airport cluster. They comprisetwo Singapore Polytechnic students, an administrative staff at ST Electronics (Jurong East), a delivery personnel at AST Logistics, an unemployed woman and a waiter at Pizza Hut at Westgate. Five more cases were added to the McDonald\\'s delivery riders cluster, which now has a total of 10 patients linked to it. Four of them are staff for Pizza Hut (Punggol Plaza) while another works as a delivery rider for Pizza Hut (Havelock II). Of these, one is a 31-year-old delivery rider for the Pizza Hut outlet at Punggol Plaza who was a close contact of delivery riders at McDonald\\'s (Bedok Reservoir) and McDonald\\'s (Pasir Ris Elias Community Club). Among them are two part-timers - thePeicai Secondary School student and the Greendale Secondary School student. The Peicai Secondary School student had developed a cough last Thursdaybut did not seek medical treatment. He had last gone to school on May 4. He was tested on Sunday and his test came back positive on the same day. The Greendale Secondary School student was asymptomatic and detected when he went to a general practitioner clinic for a Covid-19 test on Sunday after he was encouraged to do so by his employer. He had last gone to school on May 17. Meanwhile, a 51-year-old prison inmate at Changi Prison Complex was added to the cluster there. He was a close contact of the first case detected in the cluster, a 39-year-old chef at the prison, and had been quarantined on May 13. Separately, another dealer at the Marina Bay Sands casino has been added to the cluster linked to his colleagues. A 38-year-old teacher at Maha Bodhi School and an eight-year-old pupil at Yu Neng Primary School were also added to the Learning Point cluster. Both were contacts of previous cases. The pupil was a classmate of an eight-year-old boy who had attended the classes of the first case in the cluster, a 50-year-old Learning Point tutor. Separately, a two-year-old preschooler at Heartfield Kindergarten was added to a cluster linked to a 53-year-old personal chauffeur. The two unlinked cases in the community announced on Monday were a 31-year-old engineer at Hiap Seng Engineering and a 31-year-old property agent with ERA Realty Network. There were also 12 imported cases who had been placed on stay-home notice on arrival in Singapore. Of these, three are Singaporeans and two are permanent residents. The new cases take Singapore\\'s total tally to 61,860. The number of new cases in the community has risen from 149 cases two weeks ago to 185 in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community in a week has remained stable at 32 cases per week. With 22 patients discharged on Monday, 61,301 patients have fully recovered from the disease. A total of 244 patients remain in hospital, including three in critical condition in the intensive care unit, while 268 are recuperating in community facilities.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - The Changi Airport Terminal 3 cluster began in the arrival gates and baggage claim hall, where airport staff worked in close proximity to arriving passengers, investigations by Changi Airport Group (CAG) have shown. About half of airport workers who tested positive for Covid-19 were found spread out in the arrival zone, suggesting that areas where staff and arriving passengers were in close contact were the sites of the \"primary infection\", said CAG chief executive Lee Seow Hiang on Monday (May 24). Those working in these areas then mingled with others working in the transit areas, departure gates and the Basement 2 foodcourt - \"where the risk profile is no different than the rest of Singapore\" - leading to secondary clusters of infection that eventually spread the coronavirus to more than 100 people. Mr Lee noted that the other zones were \"relatively clean\". \"For instance, in the central transit area, there are about 2,000 people working there. By now, we have swabbed close to 97 per cent of them and there are zero cases, except for a specific cluster where investigations subsequently show there was a mingling of staff with those in the arrival zone,\" he said at a press conference. A total of 43 positive Covid-19 cases have been detected among airport staff to date. Of these, about half - 10 at arrival gates and 11 at the baggage claim hall - worked in the arrival zone at T3. The secondary cluster that Mr Lee referred to, in the part of the transit area immediately bordering the arrival zone, has six cases. Further from this boundary, a lone case has been detected at the departure immigration checkpoint in the transit area. A key site of secondary spread that has been raised by Health Minister Ong Ye Kung is the Basement 2 foodcourt, where 12 of the 21 T3 arrival zone workers visited. Since then, 10 non-transit airport staff who visited the foodcourt have tested positive. It is the first time staff have been infected in public areas in the airport , Mr Lee said. \"The public areas include offices, retail offerings, including Jewel -8,000 people work in this zone. Similarly, close to 97 per cent of people have been swabbed. Zero positive cases, except the foodcourt. \"This foodcourt is subsidised for airport workers and is de facto the canteen for (those working in the arrival zone) and also serves the public. It is now quite clear that although there was a lot of attention on this, the foodcourt is not the issue. \"It is a secondary source of infection.\" There are also two cases of staff who tested positive at an arrival gate in Terminal 1, which also handles flights from high-risk countries. It is not known how they got the virus, but contact tracing showed that the two had also visited the T3 foodcourt. They could have been infected by arriving passengers or at T3. The remaining three airport workers whose test results came back positive are likely to have been infected due to close contact with other airport workers outside the workplace, in their capacity as housemates or family members. Last week, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore and CAG had said that the initial transmission that led to the T3 cluster could have occurred through an airport worker who was assisting a family from South Asia, who had arrived in Singapore on April 29. Asked by reporters how exactly this happened, Mr Lee said: \"I think we have disclosed what we know from a CAG point of view, and I don\\'t want to speculate on the other details that areongoing in the investigations. \"We are taking a complete, comprehensive look, based on the World Health Organisation and our own health authorities\\' understanding of the different modes of transmission. That\\'s more or less the most important at the moment, over and above the micro-aspects of individuals.\" He did not pinpoint any particular country as the source of infection. It was revealed on Sunday that the South Asian family did not arrive on a flight from India. Test results for the initial batch of airport workers indicate the presence of the B1617 variant, which was first detected there.

       " {'text': 'why do we need skilled foreign workers in singapore Employment Passes allow companies to bring in foreign professionals to plug skills gaps and supply shortages, so as to attract and root high-value activities in Singapore. This is necessary to create and sustain a wide range of good jobs that meet Singaporeans’ career aspirations.For example, to develop our ICT and software industries, which require highly specialised skills and knowledge, global companies like Google, Grab, and Facebook need workers with the relevant skills and experience to fill all the jobs they create. There may not be enough Singapore citizens with these skills and experience to anchor these global companies’ investment. Hence, Government should do as the previous generation did to anchor the electronics industry, which was to create the jobs in Singapore first, even if some of these higher-paying jobs went to foreigners initially, and to train Singapore citizens and upgrade their skills to eventually take on these higher-paying jobs.To ensure that Singapore citizens do not have their salaries undercut by foreigners, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) requires Employment Pass applicants to meet salary thresholds, which are regularly updated taking reference from the salaries of locals with similar experience and seniority. For example, the Employment Pass minimum qualifying salary will be raised from $3,600 to $3,900 with effect from 1 May 2020. The salary thresholds for older and more experienced applicants will also be raised in tandem. For example, an EP applicant in his early 40s will need to earn around double the new minimum qualifying salary of $3,900.MOM also requires employers to make jobs accessible to Singapore citizens, and recruit fairly based on merit. Under the Fair Consideration Framework (FCF), employers must advertise on MyCareersFuture.sg before they make an Employment Pass application.MOM also proactively identifies employers that are suspected to have discriminatory hiring practices, and places them on the FCF Watchlist. Their Employment Pass applications are closely scrutinised by MOM, and uncooperative employers have had their work pass privileges withdrawn.In January 2020, MOM strengthened the FCF by raising penalties across the board for all discrimination cases (including age, race, nationality and mental health condition). Employers that violate the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices (TGFEP) will be barred from hiring new foreign workers and renewing existing foreign workers, for a minimum of 12 months up to a maximum of 24 months. MOM will also prosecute employers and key personnel who make false declarations on fair consideration. If convicted, they could face up to 2 years of imprisonment, fined up to $20,000, or both.Members of the public who encounter workplace discrimination should report it to TAFEP. Beyond the employers, MOM will also take individual employees to task if they were involved in any unfair hiring practices, including revoking their work passes if they are foreigners.With effect from 1 October 2020, all employment agencies (EAs) will be subject to new licence conditions that require them to comply with the fair recruitment requirements in the TGFEP when recruiting on behalf of their clients.In addition to helping their clients fulfil job advertising requirements, EAs must also (i) brief their clients on the fair recruitment requirements in the TGFEP; (ii) make reasonable efforts to attract Singaporeans for vacancies that they are trying to fill, except where the employer undertakes to do so through other channels; and (iii) consider all candidates based on merit. EAs that fail to comply with licence conditions may be issued with demerit points, have their licence suspended or revoked, or face prosecution.', 'id': 'e95d27b5-a26e-4445-9f6c-61ddc8cbd801', 'score': None, 'probability': None, 'question': None, 'meta': {'category': 'articles'}, 'embedding': None},\n",

Two of them are Singapore Polytechnic (SP) students from the School of Chemical & Life Sciences (CLS) and they have been linked to the Jem and Westgate cluster, said an SP spokesman on Monday. The other two cases are students from Peicai Secondary School and Greendale Secondary School. They work part-time at a Pizza Hut in Punggol Plaza, and are linked to the McDonald\\'s delivery riders cluster. The latest cases involving SP students bring the total number of Covid-19 cases from the polytechnic to eight since the first case was detected on May 15. The two recently infected students were last on the polytechnic\\'s campus on May 14, and they are both Malaysian nationals who are also family members and household contacts. The first, a Year 3 CLS student, developed symptoms in the evening of May 14 after class, but did not seek medical treatment until Wednesday (May 19), said the spokesman. She was tested on the same day, and was confirmed as a positive case on Sunday. As she was last on campus during her infectious period, her close contacts have been placed on quarantine, said SP. The student\\'s family member is a Year 2 CLS student. She developed symptoms on Tuesday (May 18) and saw a doctor the next day. She was not infectious when she was last on campus. \"We have thoroughly cleaned and disinfected the campus premises visited by the students,\" said the SP spokesman. \"SP is in touch with both students to monitor their well-being and we wish them a speedy recovery.\" Last Saturday, the swabbing exercise for at least 8,500 SP students, staff and vendors were completed, and all have tested negative, said SP. \"In view of this, there are currently no plans to extend testing to the rest of the SP community,\" the spokesman added. The polytechnic has more than 14,000 students and staff. On Monday, MOH also announced that two secondary school students who work part-time at Pizza Hut Punggol Plaza have been confirmed to have Covid-19. The 15 year-old student from Peicai Secondary School developed a cough on May 20 but did not seek medical treatment. He was tested for Covid-19 on Sunday (May 23), and it returned positive on the same day. He developed a fever on Sunday as well. In a letter to parents seen by The Straits Times, Peicai Secondary School said since the student had not been in school for the past two weeks, MOH has determined that there is no contact tracing required among contacts within the school. The Greendale Secondary School student is a 16-year-old who had last gone to school on May 17. He is asymptomatic, and was detected when he went to a GP clinic for a Covid-19 test on May 23 after he was encouraged to do so by his employer. As he had been identified as a close contact of the Peicai Secondary School student, he was placed on quarantine on Sunday evening. He tested positive on Monday.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - Singapore\\'s autonomous universities will be able to admit more students this year as overseas study options continue to be disrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic, said Education Minister Chan Chun Sing. In a Facebook post on Monday morning (May 24), Mr Chan said the local universities will have \"some flexibility\" to admit more students, but that admissions will not be made easier. \"The autonomous universities will continue to uphold admission standards, and ensure a high quality of education,\" he said. In response to queries, the Education Ministry (MOE) said it is working closely with the six autonomous universities to determine the “appropriate number of places” that will be opened up to undergraduates this year. This will be done by monitoring the quality of the applicants as well as student demand in the ongoing admissions exercise, it added. An MOE spokesman, in an e-mail statement, said: “The allocation of additional places across the universities and courses will take into account relevant factors such as the quality of the applicant pool, areas/disciplines with strong student interest and employment prospects, and the autonomous universities’ capacity to take in more students.” She added that MOE will continue to monitor the global Covid-19 situation, and work closely with the autonomous universities to support students, to ensure that their education journeys are not disrupted by the pandemic. Singapore’s six autonomous universities are: the National University of Singapore, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore Institute of Technology, Singapore Management University, Singapore University of Social Sciences and Singapore University of Technology and Design. Last year, the Ministry of Education (MOE) said the six autonomous universities would make about 2,000 more offers across a range of courses. In January this year, former education minister Lawrence Wong revealed that about 1,000 extra places were given out across the autonomous universities. Some of these places went to those who had planned to study overseas, while others went to those who opted to study instead of joining a weak job market. Mr Chan added that MOE will continue to monitor the global Covid-19 situation and work closely with the autonomous universities to support students. The pandemic, along with rising anti-Asian hate crimes in the West, have led to a drop in the numbers of Singaporean students applying to traditionally popular higher education destinations. Statistics on the British government website show that the number of student visa applications from Singaporeans to Britain fell from 2,535 new applications in 2019 to 1,421 last year. For Australia, applications fell from 1,315 in 2019 to 530 last year, a 59 per cent decrease. Get the ST Smart Parenting newsletter for expert advice. Visit the microsite for more.

SINGAPORE - It seems a lifetime ago, but it has barely been half a year since the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine landed on our sunny shores, and was first delivered into the arms of our intrepid clinicians at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases. Up till last month (April), with shots in hand and safe management measures in place, Singapore was seemingly on the front foot in this fight against Covid-19, with steady progress on vaccinations, tentative steps towards travel bubbles and even the promise of the World Economic Forum (WEF) meeting bringing some light to a dreary year. If a week is a long time in politics, then a month is an eternity in a pandemic. With daily unlinked community cases rising over the last weeks, we are now back under significant social restrictions, travel bubbles have popped and the WEF has finally accepted that its party has been well and truly rained on. Vaccines are a key weapon in this battle against a mercurial enemy. In December last year, I first wrote about the trustworthiness of vaccines, despite their speedy development. It is worth reiterating that the initial studies were designed to gather as much robust data, as quickly and as safely as possible, so as to gain expeditious approval and deployment. In a remarkable feat of drug development, several efforts, notably from the mRNA platforms such as the ones we use in Singapore, were able to demonstrate safety and efficacy, and gain emergency approval in record time. However, a focused vaccines development package bent on speed to patients has left several gaps in our collective understanding of how to best harness the use of these transcendent assets. Researchers and companies have not stood still. Over the last weeks, several developments have been announced that will enable us to use these tools even more effectively. As Sars-CoV-2 - the virus which causes Covid-19 - evolves and mutates, we too need to expand the use of our weapons, and adapt our tactics. First, in the middle of this month, both the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Singapore's Health Sciences Authority (HSA) approved the use of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for adolescents aged 12 to 15 years. While prioritising the adult cohort study at the start of clinical development, Pfizer-BioNTech rapidly expanded the pivotal phase three study to include over 2,000 adolescents, fully cognisant that in order for herd immunity to be achieved, the large swathe of under-16s could not be ignored. In filings to the regulators, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine demonstrated both exceptional efficacy against Covid-19 illness, and a good safety profile in the 12- to 15-year-old cohort, commensurate with what had been observed in older trial participants. The vaccine also elicited a strong antibody response in the adolescents, with neutralising antibody levels that were not inferior when compared to young adults aged 16 to 25 years. This data provides welcome news for Singapore, where the latest outbreak has infiltrated schools, prompting school closures and disruptions to classes. At the time of writing, the Ministry of Health is working with the Ministry of Education and will provide updates in due course on vaccinations for this school-going age group, but the door is now at least formally open to the possibility. As at last week, the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said that at least 600,000 adolescents have received their first dose, barely a week after approval. It should be noted that Moderna's study in adolescents has also completed recruitment, and both companies have embarked on studies in children below the age of 12. Next, evolving data from real-world usage has indicated that an extension of the dosing interval between the first and second vaccine doses, beyond the prescribed 21 and 28 days, to up to 12 weeks may be warranted. An Israeli study on healthcare workers showed that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was effective in providing good to excellent protection for individuals within 28 days after the first dose, reducing infections and illness. Another recent study by the University of Birmingham and Public Health England, currently in pre-print, established that antibody response in an elderly cohort who received a second dose of vaccine at 11 to 12 weeks from the first dose was as good as, if not higher than, that for those who had received the standard regimen. A third study, headed by the Mayo Clinic, ran simulations on population health outcomes, comparing the scenarios of providing standard dosing versus prioritising the first dose to a wider population and delaying second doses. This simulation showed that under certain conditions, for high-efficacy vaccines, this trade-off resulted in lower overall mortality and a public health benefit. Last, in a quiet announcement last week, the European Medicines Agency approved an expansion of storage conditions for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. Readers may recall that a key impediment for the deployment of the mRNA vaccines at the beginning was the stringent requirements for ultra-cold storage at minus 70 deg C, and a very limited shelf life once thawed. With further testing and data, that requirement has been relaxed, as the European agency now extends the storage period at 2 to 8 deg C, after the vaccine has been thawed, from five days to 31 days. Although the impact to Singapore may not be so significant as our transport chains within the country are short, this may have a major impact in regions where low availability of deep freeze cabinets constrains the use of such vaccines. In fact, this opens up the real possibility of cross-border supply, where one country can maintain a deep freeze capability, and thaw and send out to other less well-resourced nations, where a 31-day shelf life under normal refrigeration temperatures is far more feasible to manage. As the Covid-19 pandemic rumbles into its second year, vaccines have now come to the fore as a key weapon to help end it. The initial core data packages put this weapon into the hands of governments and public health officials expeditiously. By some estimates, up to 1.5 billion doses have been delivered to hundreds of millions of patients globally. This dwarfs by several orders of magnitude the number of patients who had entered into vaccine trials. With this, the broad diversity of settings in which vaccines have been used and other formal follow-on studies conducted by companies and researchers, our understanding of vaccine safety, efficacy and product characteristics is far richer today. At this critical juncture, as Singapore faces another surge in cases, this understanding has allowed our decision-makers to make timely and rational adjustments to our vaccine deployment policies and operations, to optimise public health protection. • Dr Danny Soon is chief executive officer at the Consortium for Clinical Research and Innovation, Singapore (Cris) and concurrent executive director at the Singapore Clinical Research Institute (SCRI).

       " {'text': \"covid 19 restrictions fairly aggressive but necessary not all viable in long term experts Read 3 articles daily and stand to win ST rewards, including the ST News Tablet worth $398. Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - Vaccinations are a more sustainable way of protecting the population, though the current slew of Covid-19 curbs - while fairly aggressive – are necessary, experts said. It is gratifying that the nation stopped short of a circuit breaker, which will otherwise signify that Singapore can no longer control the virus’ spread, Professor Dale Fisher, an infectious disease expert from the National University of Singapore’s (NUS) Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, said on Tuesday. “But I believe we would have a circuit breaker in place if there was no vaccine,” said Prof Fisher, who is also the chair of the World Health Organisation’s Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network. He added that Singapore’s moderately high vaccination rate of over 30 per cent of the population, which includes those who have already received their first jab, is a game changer in helping the nation avoid another circuit breaker. The speed at which clusters have grown, such as the largest one in Changi Airport – which has ballooned to more than 80 cases over just two weeks – coupled with more unlinked cases and the growing number of active clusters, are some of Singapore’s worrying Covid-19 trends. But re-entering a circuit breaker – which would bar intermingling between different households – would give the authorities time to understand what is happening in the community and let healthcare facilities recuperate and reduce their load, Professor Teo Yik Ying, dean of NUS’ Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, said at a webinar. The webinar, organised by the NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, was hosted by Associate Professor David Allen. It also featured Dr Louisa Sun, an associate consultant with the infectious diseases team at the National University Hospital and Alexandra Hospital, and Associate Professor Hsu Li Yang, vice-dean of global health at the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health. The experts took a deeper look at current restrictions – such as the complete shift to home-based learning (HBL) in schools – which have been disruptive. HBL was done as a precautionary measure, given that the B1617 variant is more likely to infect children. Prof Teo said HBL is not a long-term strategy. Instead, vaccination of children, where those aged 12 to 15 can now get the Pfizer-BioNTech shot in Singapore, will be a more sustainable way of protecting children in the long run. Home-based learning and school closures increase inequity because families that are more able to cope will do better, while other parents may struggle to make sure their children can keep up with the curriculum, as well as to supervise them. “HBL is just a way for us to tap the brakes, learn a bit more about the chains of transmission that are happening in schools, but it is not going to be a long-term strategy,” Prof Teo said. Other strategies, such as rostered routine testing, are also not part of a viable long-term strategy because of the tremendous costs, inconvenience and low yield, Prof Hsu added. “But as a way of preventing transmission to more vulnerable members of the community and providing assurance that measures are in place, it sends a good message. “But in the long run, we will probably not be able to sustain it,” Prof Hsu said. When asked if Singapore should adopt a zero-tolerance approach to Covid-19 or learn to live with it as an endemic disease, the panel felt that the endpoint of this pandemic will realistically see Covid-19 becoming an endemic disease. “We are going to need high levels of vaccination which will reduce Covid-19 to a fairly mild disease which can circulate around,” Prof Fisher said. He added that much work remains in helping the community understand that Covid-19 is heading towards becoming an endemic disease and to accept the presence of cases and clusters. A zero-tolerance strategy will mean extremely strict border controls which will create an artificial sense of stability and safety, a strategy that would not last long for many countries, Prof Teo added. “Vaccination was designed to minimise serious symptoms and side effects but not meant to completely block the risk of infection. “If we are vaccinated, then get infected and are asymptomatic, and do not have a risk of going to the hospital or suffer from a serious side effect – that looks like one of the ways of living with the disease in the long term,” Prof Teo said. Prof Hsu pointed out that in the history of human diseases, such as measles and tuberculosis, mankind has learnt to live with them, with the help of vaccination.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - Countries around the world that are trying to contain the Covid-19 pandemic, including Singapore, must be mentally prepared that it will be a long and uncertain battle. \"We are actually fighting a very agile virus. Whenever there is any gap in our defence, it gets through, and multiplies exponentially,\" said Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat at the Nikkei Conference on Thursday (May 20). The immediate challenge, he added, is to contain Covid-19 and avoid economic scarring. Last year, the Government committed close to $100 billion - or 20 per cent of gross domestic product - in Covid-19 support across five Budgets. Explaining the reason for providing this extensive support, Mr Heng said: \"If companies were to be closed and workers retrenched, it will be very hard to rebuild when the situation gets better. So, maintaining that capability is very important.\" At the same time, Covid-19 has accelerated changes ranging from digitalisation to sustainability, he added. This is why industry transformation maps (ITMs) were launched in 2016 under the Future Economy Council (FEC), he said. These are road maps to drive transformation of 23 industries across manufacturing, built environment, trade and connectivity, essential domestic services, modern services and lifestyle. To seize new opportunities in a post-Covid-19 world, the ITMs will be refreshed as part of a new plan over the next five years dubbed ITM 2025, with three new thrusts: incorporating the recommendations of the Emerging Stronger Taskforce; closer integration with research and innovation; and greater focus on jobs and skills. Mr Heng, who is also Coordinating Minister for Economic Policies and chairman of the FEC, said: \"We are looking at how to help companies adopt technology and innovation, re-engineer processes, and redefine jobs - which are very important when the population is ageing. We will also expand cooperation with other countries so that we can have a bigger market. \"Covid-19 has changed the rules of how many economic activities are conducted. The Emerging Stronger Taskforce has just issued a report, and I\\'ll be incorporating that work into our plans.\" The Government convened the 23-member task force last May to identify systemic shifts arising from Covid-19, and provide recommendations to the FEC on how Singapore could refresh, reimagine, or reset its economic strategies. In a report released on Monday (May 17), the task force made recommendations to drive the Republic\\'s transformation as a node for technology, innovationand enterprise. They are: creating new virtual frontiers;seizing growth opportunities from sustainability; enabling global champions and growing an agile and strong Singapore core; institutionalising private-public partnerships through Alliances for Action (AfAs); and strengthening international partnerships, especially in South-east Asia. While much of the world\\'s attention is on the United States-China relationship, Singapore\\'s good relations with its partners extends beyond these two countries, said Mr Heng. Stressing that constructive competition can help promote innovation and new solutions, he said he hoped that Singapore will continue to work closely with all of its key partners. Mr Heng said: \"I hope that we take a open, inclusive approach to our relationships across the world.\" Join ST\\'s Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - New Covid-19 cases here have not shot up in the past week thanks to the stricter precautions that Singapore has taken, said Health Minister Ong Ye Kung on Saturday (May 22). The country tightened its safety measures from May 16, including banning dining in and restricting social gatherings. Mr Ong said that the number of new coronavirus infections has been hovering around about 20 to 30 a day since then. Said Mr Ong: \"So you are not seeing the kind of sharp increase in cases that you will see if you don\\'t take any precautions, don\\'t do any testing, don\\'t do any contact tracing. In those circumstances, usually every week, you will see the cases double and double - very scary.\" The minister noted that the number of coronavirus cases here was stabilising. \"I hope we continue that way. We still have to watch for a few more days before we know which direction the cases are heading. But also continue to do our part, so that we can suppress it,\" he said. Mr Ong was speaking at a Facebook Live virtual event for charity Blossom Seeds that launched a new campaign called Unity in Diversity. The campaign, which was launched in the light of the upcoming Vesak Day on Wednesday(May 26), aims to bring together community partners, donors and volunteers from different races and religions to support vulnerable community members, including seniors with medical conditions. Blossom Seeds is partnering with organisations such as the Darul Makmur and Assyafaah mosques for this campaign. Members of the public who are keen to contribute to the campaign and donate to the charity can do so by finding out more on Blossom Seeds\\'website and Facebook page. In a press release on Saturday, the charity said that it plans to raise $300,000 from Unity in Diversity. During the event, Blossom Seeds also provided updates onits new renovated centre, located in Canberra Street. The renovations were completed earlier this year, and the centre now includes new facilities, such asa gym, therapy rooms and food preparation areas. \"Our centre will serve as the go-to point for both vulnerable and active seniors and a platform to connect our socially isolated seniors with the community,\" said Blossom Seeds. To keep seniors active, the charity has been focusing on taking activities online. For instance, exercise classes have been conducted over video-conferencing platform Zoom. It also continues to engage seniors through video and phone calls. Blossom Seeds chief executive Ong Siew Chin said the charity serves all races and religions and emphasised how many seniors in the community need support. \"We have to work with community partners because there are so many roles to be undertaken, we cannot do it on our own. It helps when our partners support us with volunteers or share about the campaign,\" she said. Join ST\\'s Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) has apologised to DJ Jade Rasif for saying that her account of her domestic worker\\'s Covid-19 scare was \"inaccurate\". In a Facebook post last night, MOM said it was retracting its point about Ms Rasif\\'s \"inaccurate\" account, and redacting the word \"inaccurate\" from its post on Monday. \"We note that the use of the word \\'inaccurate\\' and one of the points in our May 17 FB post could have portrayed Ms Rasif to be providing an inaccurate account on the quarantine order investigation,\" the ministry said in its post. \"She shared with us that this had affected her negatively. We would like to extend our apologies to her for this.\" Ms Rasif\\'s posts on Instagram and Facebook last Sunday detailed how her domestic helper had been discharged on her third day of stay-home notice (SHN), only to test positive for Covid-19 two weeks later on April 30. She raised concerns about whether it was safe for her domestic worker to be released early from SHN, and questioned why she had not been put under quarantine. MOM had initially disputed Ms Rasif\\'s claims that police officers had called her saying she was under investigation for breaching a quarantine order. The ministry had also said she could not be under investigation as she was never issued a quarantine order. Ms Rasif then posted Instagram stories on Thursday with screenshots and audio recordings of communications between her and MOM that appeared to contradict parts of the ministry\\'s statement on Monday. She included a recording of a phone call where a man, who Ms Rasif said was MOM \"management\", could be heard laughing after Ms Rasif raised concerns about the ministry\\'s statement. MOM\\'s post yesterday said: \"We understand that the police have since clarified with Ms Rasif on the purpose of their calls, and that she is not being investigated for any breach of quarantine orders.\" The ministry also retracted its claim that it had reached out to Ms Rasif\\'s family on a complaint made against an ambulance driver, who Ms Rasif alleged had texted her an expletive. It also said it had called Ms Rasif and discussed the way its officers had handled a call with her on Tuesday. In its Facebook post on Monday, MOM explained that Ms Rasif\\'s domestic worker was assessed to be a recovered Covid-19 patient and no longer infectious. She was discharged from isolation on May 9. Ms Rasif, now a healthcare worker, told The Sunday Times: \"I feel vindicated... I\\'m very satisfied with the apology and their statement. I\\'m very happy that MOM is actually looking into things and looking to tighten up (its processes).

SINGAPORE -A total of 42 students from 30 schools have been infected with Covid-19 over the past four weeks, including six new cases reported on Thursday (May 20). This includes 15 cases linked to a cluster at the Learning Point tuition centre and another 11 to one at Changi Airport Terminal 3. The affected schools range from pre-schools to primary and secondary schools, a madrasah, junior college and several institutes of higher learning. Among the 42, there are 26 male and 16 female students, and 29 of them are aged 12 or below. The Learning Point cluster emerged after a 50-year-old Singaporean woman who teaches at its Parkway Centre branch tested positive for the virus on May 12. The cluster now has 28 cases. The Changi Airport cluster was uncovered after an 88-year-old cleaner for Ramky Cleantech Services was found to have the virus on May 5. As at Thursday night, the cluster has 100 cases and is the largest active cluster in Singapore. Among schools, Kong Hwa School has four pupils aged eight to nine who are linked to the Learning Point cluster. St Stephen's School and St Andrew's Junior School have each reported three cases. The pupils from St Andrew's Junior School have been linked to the Learning Point cluster, as have two of the St Stephen's School pupils. The third pupil from St Stephen's School is linked to the Changi Airport cluster. Singapore Polytechnic has four students who have been infected, including three aged 16, 18 and 19, and a 32-year-old adult learner. The younger three have not yet been linked to any cluster, while the 32-year-old has been linked to eight other cases. A number of students in the Learning Point cluster also attended tuition classes elsewhere. Two seven-year-old girls from CHIJ (Katong) Primary and Maha Bodhi School both attended the Seedlings World Student Care @ Frankel centre. Others from the Learning Point cluster attended the Wang Learning Centre at East Coast and The Learning Lab at United Square. Three pupils linked to the Changi Airport cluster also attended tuition classes together at the EduFirst Learning Centre in Hougang. They are two boys from Yio Chu Kang Primary and one from Palm View Primary. The HCL Education Centre in Katong V has also reported a Covid-19 case among its students. Affected pre-schools include Bethesda (Pasir Ris) Kindergarten, My First Skool at Westgate, the Singapore Hokkien Huay Kuan Pre-school and the Skool4Kidz Preschool in Punggol Way, with one pupil each. There was also a three-year-old boy who tested positive on April 28 and last attended school on April 22, but the Ministry of Health did not say which school he attended.

SINGAPORE - About 6,500 students, staff and vendors at Singapore Polytechnic (SP) will be tested for Covid-19 from Wednesday (May 19), after three students earlier tested positive for the virus. There is currently no evidence to show that these cases, which were reported on Sunday and Monday, are linked to one another, said SP in a statement. \"However, given the three positive cases, as well as the locations and proximity of their schools in SP\\'s campus, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has decided to take an additional precautionary measure to reduce the risk of transmission within our campus,\" it added. The ministry prioritised several groups to be swabbed - about 6,500 students, staff and food court vendors from five schools in SP who were on campus on or after April 29. The schools include the School of Computing, the Media, Arts & Design School, the School of Business and the School of Mechanical & Aeronautical Engineering. Only students on Continuing Education and Training (CET) courses and programmes from the School of Electrical & Electronic Engineering will have to be swabbed for now. The testing, expected to last a few days, will take place at the Sports Arena of SP\\'s Dover Road Campus, the school said. All affected individuals will be informed by the Health Ministry via SMS on the details of their swab tests. MOH said it will consider the overall risk level after the first segment of testing is completed, before deciding if the rest of the SP community has to be swabbed. The polytechnic has more than 14,000 students and staff. Since Tuesday, SP has moved all lessons online until May 28, including practical classes. Prior to this, all tutorials and lectures were already planned to be conducted online until the end of Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) on June 13. SP has also thoroughly cleaned and disinfected the campus premises while a leave of absence has been issued to the students\\' classmates. On Monday, a 16-year-old SP student was reported to have the B1617 variant of the virus that was first detected in India, while a 32-year-old IT engineer enrolled as a part-time adult learner also tested positive for the virus. On Sunday, an 18-year-old Year 2 student from the Media, Arts and Design school was reported to have the virus. He was last on campus on May 11. The three students are doing well, said SP.

Minister for Culture, Community and Youth Edwin Tong visited the federation at its premises in Geylang on Sunday. In a Facebook post, he said he had visited to explain the current situation to the federation and to thank them for their understanding and leadership. \"A regular Vesak Day would usually see thousands of Buddhists visit the temples, engaged in a day of prayers and offerings, performing Three Step One Bow procession, Light Transference ceremony, and the bathing of Prince Siddhartha. This year, however, these activities will again have to be scaled down and also moved online,\" he said. \"I know many people seek solace in religion, and I hope that we will be able to overcome this recent spate of infections, and resume some degree of community events again. \"Venerable Seck Kwang Phing, president of the Singapore Buddhist Federation, showed me their live stream set-up, which was put together by their millennial generation.

The man, who had not been vaccinated against Covid-19, was confirmed to have the virus on April 30. He also had a history of lung cancer and atrial fibrillation. The Health Ministry said: \"The National Centre for Infectious Diseases has reached out to his family and is extending assistance to them.\" As at Thursday, the TTSH cluster, which is Singapore\\'s first hospital Covid-19 cluster, comprises 46 people. This is the second death to emerge from the TTSH cluster. On May 1, an 88-year-old Singaporean woman died from complications due to Covid-19. She had also been hospitalised in Ward 9D, and was there from April 14. The woman, who had a history of cancer, hypertension, congestive cardiac failure, stroke and hyperlipidaemia, was confirmed to have Covid-19 on April 28. On the same day, the Health Ministry announced that a 46-year-old nurse working in the ward had tested positive for the virus. She had completed her vaccination on Feb 18, and developed a cough, sore throat and body aches on April 27 before seeking medical treatment. On April 28, Ward 9D was placed on lockdown. Three other wards - Ward 7D, 9C and 10B - were later placed on lockdown as well. TTSH later stopped admitting new patients. On May 18, the hospital progressively resumed admissions with a new approach, including testing for its staff and patients, to bolster its defences.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - The suffering and the millions of lives lost due to Covid-19 could have been prevented if many countries around the world had not taken a wait-and-see approach in the early days, said local experts, weighing in after the recent release of a scathing report on the handling of Covid-19. The report, titled Covid-19: Make It The Last Pandemic, was compiled by a panel assembled by former New Zealand prime minister Helen Clark and former Liberian president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, at the request of World Health Organisation (WHO) director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. The Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response found gaps and failings at every point in the chain of preparedness and response to the disease, which has killed several million globally. This was despite years of warnings of an inevitable pandemic, it said. On Friday (May 21), the WHO put its early estimate for last year\\'s global excess deaths due to Covid-19 at 3.4 million. It said deaths reported to WHO are likely a significant undercount, with true figures at least two to three times higher. At the G-20 Global Health Summit on Friday, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said Covid-19 will not be the last, or worst, pandemic. The world must thus take every opportunity to learn from this pandemic to prepare for the next one, he said. In its report, the panel said the global alert system was too slow and meek, the WHO was under-powered, and global political leadership was absent. It faulted governments and leaders for ignoring early warnings, saying that February was a \"lost month\" as too many governments acted only after they had seen widespread local transmission. The WHO declared the Covid-19 outbreak a public health emergency of international concern on Jan 30 last year. It was its highest alarm - sounded previously for six outbreaks, including the 2019 Ebola outbreak in Congo - but it was largely ignored. The WHO eventually used the unofficial term \"pandemic\" to describe Covid-19 on March 11. \"Regrettably, many countries, including those in Europe and North America, did not make full use of the global alert, whether issued by the WHO or from the striking developments happening in China, South Korea and Italy,\" said Professor Teo Yik Ying, dean of the National University of Singapore\\'s (NUS) Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health. Professor Tikki Pangestu, a visiting professor at the NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, said the \"slowness in responding until it was too late\" was the biggest mistake made in this pandemic. Prof Teo, who had contributed to the report by sharing details on the management of Covid-19 in the Asia-Pacific and the lessons learnt here, said global health is as much about geopolitics as it is about health. \"Poor decision-making by the leaders of countries or state governments have impeded public health and medical responses at the national and sub-national levels,\" he said. The question is to what extent global leaders can extend their jurisdiction to encroach into the national responses of other countries, he said. At the same time, the fracture in global leadership, whether due to trade and economy, religion or civil rights, means that it will always be difficult to coordinate between country leaders who may be guided by different priorities, he added. Prof Pangestu, who previously worked at the WHO, said: \"Other pandemics will come - it is a question of \\'when\\', not \\'if\\'. But hopefully, the recommendations from the panel, if implemented, will better prepare countries for future incidents.\" The panel said the world must act now to prevent future infectious disease outbreaks from becoming catastrophic pandemics. Its recommendations include strengthening the WHO\\'s independence, authority and financing, which is crucial, said Professor Wang Linfa of the Duke-NUS Medical School\\'s emerging infectious diseases programme. One of the world\\'s leading experts in zoonotic diseases, which are passed from animals to humans, he, too, had contributed to the report. Right now, the WHO does not have enough authority. \"It cannot order an investigation without the consensus and approval of member nations,\" he said. At the G-20 global health summit, PM Lee said the WHO has a central role to play and Singapore supports the panel\\'s recommendations. He added that Singapore will play its part by working with all countries to strengthen collective resilience against future pandemics. The panel also listed steps aimed at ending the current pandemic. One measure is for wealthy nations that have enough vaccines to provide low- and middle-income countries in the Covax vaccine-sharing scheme with at least a billion vaccine doses by September, and more than two billion by mid-2022. Over 75 per cent of all vaccine doses have been administered in only 10 countries, while the lowest-income countries have administered less than 0.5 per cent of global doses, the WHO has said. Vaccination and adherence to ongoing public health measures such as mask wearing and social distancing are \"our only hope of controlling the pandemic globally as no one is safe until everyone is safe\", said Prof Pangestu. Singapore, China, New Zealand, South Korea, Thailand and Vietnam were countries that adopted an aggressive containment strategy, the report noted. However, Thailand is now grappling with a third and worst wave, with outbreaks also in its overcrowded prisons, while a second wave has hit Singapore. The Republic has seen its first hospital cluster, and the movement of migrant workers is still strictly restricted in exchange for the health of the community, mainly as a result of coping with new coronavirus variants that are much more transmissible, said Prof Teo. \"But this is the reality that the world will be faced with, where the coronavirus will continue to evolve in order to survive against the suite of public health measures that we adopt against it,\" he said. Amid the threat of new variants, the panel has called for a mindset shift, from fighting to stop a pandemic to acknowledging that Covid-19 will be here to stay for the foreseeable future. \"Every vaccinated person is a brake on the virus, and the fewer bodies the virus travels through, the fewer chances it has to mutate,\" the panel said in its report.

       " {'text': 'speed at how changi airport covid 19 cluster grew is worrying says expert Read 3 articles daily and stand to win ST rewards, including the ST News Tablet worth $398. Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - In less than two weeks, the Changi Airport cluster has emerged as the country\\'s largest community cluster to date - second only to the outbreak in the worker dormitories - with a total of 78 Covid-19 cases linked to it. What is even more worrying is how the virus has hit a large number of elderly workers, as much as it has also infiltrated visitors to public places within the airport. Professor Teo Yik Ying, dean of the National University of Singapore\\'s Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, said that the most striking thing about this cluster is how rapidly the virus has spread between the cases. \"We have seen not just two generations of spread - but up to three and even four generations that happened within a matter of less than two weeks.\" Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said last Friday (May 14) that the workers who were infected with Covid-19 mainly received travellers from high-risk countries at azone which includes a conveyor belt and an immigration area that passengers have to pass through. Workers who were in charge of this area would then go on to have their meals at the Terminal 3 Basement 2 commercial area and food court, where they were likely to have passed on the virus to the community. This high-risk zone, which Mr Ong likened to Ward 9D of the Tan Tock Seng Hospital cluster - the ground zero of recent infections - could be a weak link where imported cases with more virulent Covid-19 variants could seep into the community. Prof Teo said the areas where people are more likely to come together, such as immigration checkpoints and baggage collection areas, are where the risk of transmission will be higher. \"The fact is that these areas are indoors and air-conditioned, thus meaning the air is cooler and less humid, creating an environment that likely permits the coronavirus to stay viable for longer, whether it is as droplets, aerosols, or on surfaces,\" he said. With emerging variants like the B1617 strain being more transmissible than what was previously seen last year, it could mean that even transient exposure through close contact with someone contagious, or increased survivability of the coronavirus would be sufficient to infect, added Prof Teo. This is even as infection prevention and control (IPC) protocols - such as the wearing of personal protective equipment and ensuring the frequent disinfecting of surfaces - continue to remain in place, suggesting that these measures may no longer be as adequate. Associate Professor Kenneth Mak, director of medical services at the Ministry of Health, said last Friday that the PPE regime for front-line workers will be reviewed, starting with the hospitals, before this is extended to other sectors. Hence, while it is important to investigate any lapses in the existing protocols, Prof Teo said that ramping up crowd segregation and IPC protocols should also be considered. The index case to the airport cluster was an 88-year-old cleaner, who was employed by Ramky Cleantech Services and deployed at Changi Airport Terminal 3. He tested positive on May 5 despite being fully vaccinated. A total of 16employees from Ramky Cleantech Services have since tested positive for the virus, with some testing positive while deployed to Robinsons 77, the former SIA Building. Most of the infected employees are cleaners, and about half the employeesare above the age of 60. Not all of them were vaccinated. The recent cases have shown that while vaccination does not completely prevent one from becoming infected, it can reduce the chances of infection and prevent the onset of serious disease. As at last Friday, only 19 out of the 28 infected airport workers were fully vaccinated. None of them needed oxygen support. Therefore, vaccinating front-line workers at all of Singapore\\'s border checkpoints, as well as those in \"outward facing professions\" is important, as they will invariably come into contact with people coming from overseas, said Prof Teo. In addition, it is important to think about who these workers are so that the net is cast wide enough to include auxiliary staff such as canteen operators, cleaners and even shuttle bus drivers of these workers, he added. Certain sectors can also put in place strong recommendations to have their workforce vaccinated - just like the case for healthcare workers - as a supportive work environment could enable a higher vaccine uptake. \"For elderly workers who are working in front-line sectors, the companies can also strongly encourage them to take up the vaccination, and to redeploy those who preferred not to be vaccinated to job scopes that are lower in risk,\" he said.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - A task force set up to guide Singapore's economic recovery from Covid-19 has identified five things the country needs to focus on to prepare its economy for the longer-term impact of the pandemic. Here are the key recommendations from the Emerging Stronger Taskforce's report, which was released on Monday (May 17). Singapore can take its Smart Nation aspirations global by building on the strong foundations of its digitalisation efforts so far, the task force said in its report. For enterprises, Singapore can build a virtual marketplace of goods and services to support the creation of new products and digital experiences, as well as participation in the trade of goods and services. For talent, the task force recommended using virtual training and workforce solutions to help Singapore companies tap global resources to better serve global demand from Singapore. This could also open up new opportunities for Singaporeans to work overseas, it said. Singapore can also redefine its relevance as a safe and smart city for trade, business, workand leisure, the task force added. The task force said Singapore should establish itself as a sustainability hub to serve global demand amid a growing green economy, while at the same time fulfilling its own commitments to fighting climate change. There should be a concerted push to establish Singapore as a carbon trading and services hub, which entails developing a carbon marketplace built on quality and trust. Singapore should also strengthen its food resilience through advancements in agritech, the task force said. It said Singapore can do so by improving the economic viability and sustainability of indoor vertical farming here and identifying broader agritech opportunities that the country should invest in and aim to lead in the years ahead. The task force also recommended strengthening the traceability and accountability of industry value chains through end-to-end digitalisation. The Government should support the growth of innovative and international large local enterprisesthrough innovation, internationalisation, mergers and acquisitions, and talent development, the task force said. But it said Singapore must also enable a broad base of companies to succeed, including small and medium-sized enterprises and micro enterprises. The task force said Singapore shouldadopt a preventive or predictive approach to skills upgrading and reskilling. This entails identifying job disruption and training needs early and developing workforce training plans, so that businesses and workers can be more resilient and ready for the future. Noting the initial success of its Alliances for Action (AfAs), which are industry-led partnerships between private and public sector stakeholders, the task force recommended institutionalising them. It said future AfAs in the economic domain should be primarily established under the Future Economy Council (FEC), and serve as an additional platform for private-public collaboration and a key enabler for transformative economic growth. Future AfAs should also take into account learning points from the task force's AfAs, and key criteria should be set up for commissioning and closing them. The report noted that not every AfA will succeed in delivering the outcomes it sets out to achieve. The FEC should therefore continue to refine the AfA model by learning from successes and gaining insights from challenges and failures. Singapore should position itself as a partner for recovery and growth, and foster win-win partnerships with its neighbours, the task force said. It added that the country can do so by working with countries in the region at all levels, including through partnerships between businesses,and deepening Singapore's engagement with, and knowledge of, the region. The task force said Singapore must contribute to South-east Asia in particular, noting that Asean was the third-largest market in Asia after China and Japan in 2019, and the fifth-largest globally. More platforms should be established to bring interested companies together to engage the region at the business-to-business level, it said. As South-east Asian countries are important digital partners for Singapore, the task force also recommended strengthening digital connectivity across the region, such as through digital economy collaborations.

       " {'text': 'experts refute claims that covid 19 jabs cause diseases Read 3 articles daily and stand to win ST rewards, including the ST News Tablet worth $398. Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. Claims that mRNA Covid-19 vaccines could cause neurological diseases such as Alzheimer\\'s and Parkinson\\'s have been making the rounds on social media and messaging apps recently. They come after the publication of a research paper that suggested mRNA vaccines such as the ones developed by Pfizer and Moderna could trigger prion disease. But scientists have been quick to debunk these claims, saying the paper held no scientific weight and that the journal in question was not a reputable or reliable one. Associate Professor Sylvie Alonso, co-director of the National University of Singapore\\'s Infectious Diseases Translational Research Programme, said prion disease is a result of one\\'s proteins adopting an unusual arrangement, causing them to aggregate. These aggregates - known as amyloids - can then harm the cells, causing neurological diseases such as Alzheimer\\'s, she added. Alzheimer\\'s disease is a consequence of amyloids accumulating in the brain cells. The mRNA vaccines contain fragments of the Sars-CoV-2 virus\\' genetic material, which has instructions for making the spike protein specific to the virus. This \"trains\" the human body to recognise the invader so that it can produce immune cells to fight against it. The research paper claimed that two types of RNA-binding proteins - namely the FUS and TDP-43 - could bind with the vaccine\\'s mRNA molecules, causing a possible formation of protein aggregates leading to neurological diseases. Debunking this, Prof Alonso said TDP-43 and FUS proteins bind to mRNA molecules and rearrange them, so as to control the body\\'s protein production. The two proteins have \"prion-like regions\" that may cause the formation of protein aggregates under certain circumstances. Accumulation of these aggregates in the central nervous system is known to lead to neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. However, there is no experimental evidence at this stage to support the claim that these proteins bind with the mRNA molecules from the vaccine, said Prof Alonso. Professor Paul Tambyah, deputy director in the same programme, said it could take years to prove or disprove such a claim, given that neurological diseases take a long time to develop. Several other social media posts have also suggested that taking the Covid-19 vaccine could lead to cardiovascular disease and stroke. For instance, a Facebook post on April 22 claimed that a man suffered three strokes within two days of receiving his first dose of the vaccine on April 18. Changi General Hospital responded on April 23 with a Facebook post saying its preliminary assessment does not indicate that the vaccine was the cause of his stroke. This was not the first time that such allegations had been made. On April 15, the Ministry of Health instructed the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act Office to issue corrections to the Facebook pages of Goh Meng Seng People\\'s Power Party and Goh Meng Seng (Satu Singapura) for implying that the Covid-19 vaccination had caused or substantially contributed to a doctor in Singapore suffering a stroke. It added that there is currently no credible evidence suggesting that there could be an increased risk of heart attack or stroke after a person takes the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine. Prof Tambyah said researchers are still learning about the coronavirus and the immune system\\'s response to its various components, including the spike protein. He noted that local researchers had recently published a study where asymptomatic patients had experienced late presentations of stroke, after recovering from Covid-19. All 18 were migrant workers who were aged between 35 and 50. However, more complete data will still be needed to prove the link between vaccination and cardiovascular disease. \"Currently, there are close to a billion people worldwide who have been vaccinated against Covid-19 and there has not been a rise in the incidence of cardiovascular disease reported or any groups identified at higher than normal risk of cardiovascular complications,\" Prof Tambyah said.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - The Republic has seen 26 cases of Covid-19 reinfection as Monday (May 10), Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said in a ministerial statement in Parliament on Tuesday. Such reinfections are known to be possible in both overseas and local cases, he noted, but itis still unclear why they occur. The minister said investigations are ongoing to determine if reinfections are due to a general waning of immunity levels over time, or a lack of cross-protection, despite a previous infection, against specific variants of the coronavirus that a person is exposed to for the first time. Mr Gan, who is co-chair of the multi-ministry task force tackling the pandemic here, noted that Singapore has detected 10 different variants of the virus among local and imported cases. The emergence of new strains is not surprising, as it is in the nature of viruses to mutate, he said. Their appearance in Singapore is also not surprising, as the nation cannot completely shut its borders. \"Singapore is not self-sufficient in many things, and we need to maintain our supply lines and global connections to survive. The virus will then find ways to infiltrate us.\" However, Mr Gan said some variants like the B16172 strain are of greater concern because of their increased transmissibility, the severity of the illness caused and their potency in resisting vaccines. The strain is believed to have sparked the clusters of cases at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) as well as at the Tuas South community care facility. Three cases at Singapore\\'s airport terminals were also found to have been infected with the B1617 strain. The B16172 strain is a sublineage of the B1617 strain, which was first detected in India in October last year. It has been dubbed the double mutant because it has two major mutations on the spike protein of the coronavirus. \"While the definitive characteristics of this variant remain unknown, the large clusters and rapid transmission we see locally is concerning, as it suggests that infections of this strain can spread quickly and widely,\" Mr Gan said. \"This is similar to the overseas situation where resurgence of cases are likely driven also by new variants.\" Mr Gan said Covid-19 vaccines, while not 100 per cent efficacious, can still prevent severe reactions to the infection and are likely to reduce the likelihood that an infected person will pass the virus on to another person. As at Monday, there have been 56 cases involving people who were infected despite being fully vaccinated, of which 30 were local cases and 26 were imported ones. About 57 per cent of local cases involving those who were vaccinated were asymptomatic, and none had severe disease requiring more intensive care, Mr Gan said, adding that this is consistent with international experience and emerging evidence. \"Data which came out from Israel last week showed that infection rate amongst unvaccinated persons was 91.5 per 100,000 person-days, while that for fully vaccinated persons was 3.1 per 100,000 person-days. \"Hospitalisation rates were 2.7 for unvaccinated and 0.2 for the fully vaccinated,\" said Mr Gan. Person-days is a measure of the number of people who participated in the study multipliedby the number of days they were observed. Mr Gan added: \"Overall, the benefits of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna Covid-19 vaccines continue to outweigh the known risks and we must continue to encourage Singaporeans tobe vaccinated.\" He also noted that data on the need for Covid-19 vaccine booster shots is still emerging from both international and local studies. \"We will share more when we know more. Meanwhile, get the first two shots first.\" Read key highlights from the ministerial statements on Singapore\\'s Covid-19 situation here.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - Indoor activities for which masks are usually removed - including dining out, exercise classes and facial treatments - will be cancelled starting Sunday (May 16) until June 13. This is because recent clusters have shown that the new Covid-19 variants are more infectious, with transmission more likely to take place in indoor settings where people do not wear masks, said Education Minister Lawrence Wong, who takes up the finance portfolio on Saturday. As well as prohibitions on eating at restaurants, hawker centres and other food and beverage outlets, people will not be allowed to take part in strenuous indoor exercise activities. This includes exercise classes as well as individual and group sports. Personalised services which require masks to be removed, such as facials and saunas, will also be banned, along with activities that involve singing or the playing of wind or brass instruments. Medical and dental services, however, will be allowed to continue. At a press conference on Friday, Mr Wong gave details on the new rules that will impact weddings, funerals, movie screenings, live performances and worship services. Wedding banquets will no longer be allowed, given the restrictions on dining out, although marriage solemnisations may continue. These are limited to 50 people, or 100 people if pre-event testing (PET) is in place. Worship services, as well as live performances and business meetings, incentives, conferences and events, are also limited to 50 people without PET or 100 people if testing is carried out. Masks are to be worn at all times - even for speakers and performers - and no singing or playing of wind instruments will be allowed. Similar rules will apply to cinemas, where groups cannot be larger than two persons and food and beverages cannot be sold or consumed. And only 20 people will be allowed at funerals at any point in time, down from 30 people now. \"We believe with safe distancing, with proper precautions and safeguards, these activities can still continue,\" Mr Wong said. \"But we would like everyone to take the measures seriously and... scale back their social interactions.\" Transmission typically happens when people let their guard down during such interactions - for instance, when they go to a friend\\'s home and remove their mask during the visit, the minister added. Under the tighter restrictions, shopping malls and showrooms will have their occupancy limits cut to one person per 16 sq m of gross floor area, down from one person per 10 sq m. All attractions that received prior approval to operate at 50 per cent of their operating capacity will have to reduce this to 25 per cent. This also applies to museums and public libraries. Apart from reducing community transmission, tightened restrictions are also necessary to protect Singapore\\'s frontline workers, such as nurses or supermarket staff, said President Halimah Yacob in a Facebook post on Friday evening. She thanked such workers for their sacrifices, adding: \"I am sure that Singaporeans will rise to the occasion and meet these challenges as how we have done in the past year.\" READ NEXT: What are the new Covid-19 rules in S\\'pore from May 16?

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - Eight British work pass holders who flouted Covid-19 rules when they took part inan unlawful gathering on a yachtoff Lazarus Island last year have been banned from working in Singapore, said the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) on Thursday (May 20). They were in court on Thursday, where they pleaded guilty to an offence under the Covid-19 (Temporary Measures) Act and were each fined $3,000. Annabelle Morgan Duke, 26, Philip Edward Knatchbull Holmes, 27, Mark Alexander Bellamy, 29, Amy Georgina Hunt, 30, Thomas Cuthbert Williams-Jones, 30, Oliver Francis William Campbell, 31, Benjamin David Waters, 32, and Amy Alexandra Stewart, 32, were part of a group of 10 people who had boarded the craft on Dec 26 last year. The group had intermingled without masks at a time when social gatherings were limited to five people. MOM said in a statement that the work passes of the eight Britons had been cancelled by their former employers earlier. Earlier in March, the other two merrymakers on the yacht - Briton Amy Grace Ropner, 28, and Singapore permanent resident Mark Lau San Mao, 30 -were also each fined $3,000 for the same offence. Ropner has since been banned from working in Singapore and the validity of Lau's re-entry permit will be shortened upon his next renewal. The court heard that the pleasure craft named Advant was owned and operated by a company called Beyond Luxury. It could be chartered for excursions through a booking agent. Hunt had contacted one such agent, Marine Bookings, last October to charter a yacht for 10 people on Boxing Day. Around 11am on Dec 26 last year, the 10 offenders met the yacht's two crew members at the Cove Avenue marina onSentosa. Before departing, the master of the yacht gave them a pre-departure briefing. They were told to keep to two groups of five, one at the front and one at the back of the yacht. They were also reminded not to mix between groups, to wear a mask when not in the water or eating or drinking, and to comply with safe management measures on board the yacht. The yacht was in waters off Lazarus Island when onlookers spotted the group. Pictures and videos of the gathering were later posted on social media. They showed a group of merrymakers dancing and intermingling without masks. Those found guilty of breaching a Covid-19 regulation can be jailed for up to six months and fined up to $10,000. Repeat offenders can be jailed for up to a year and fined up to $20,000. Join ST's Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.

A notice from the school’s principal to parents via the Parents Gateway platform said the boy was last in school on Tuesday and was well. He tested positive for the virus on Friday. Some classmates had been placed on quarantine or leave of absence as they were in close contact with the first pupil who contracted the virus. The principal, Mrs Chaillan Mui Tuan, said: \"Students and staff who were earlier placed on quarantine order (QO) will have their QO extended. Additional students and staff identified as close contacts of this student have already been placed on leave of absence or quarantined.\" The first ACS (Junior) boy is a family member and a household contact of a confirmed case -a 46-year-old Singaporean investment banker at DBS Bank. He had been placed in quarantine on Monday and developed a fever, cough and runny nose on Tuesday. The school advised its students to seek medical attention if they feel unwell, and to inform their form teachers if they display any flu-like symptoms. Parents were also urged to keep their children at home and inform the school immediately if any of their household members show symptoms of an acute respiratory infection. Including the six cases reported on Thursday, a total of 42 students from 30 schools have been infected with Covid-19 over the past four weeks.

       " {'text': 'malls hawker centres and office buildings lose buzz as singapore returns to tightened Read 3 articles daily and stand to win ST rewards, including the ST News Tablet worth $398. Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - Many office buildings and hawker centres lost their usual buzz as Singapore defaulted to working from home under tightened restrictions on Monday (May 17). While queues of up to 15 officegoers were seen buying takeaway food at Market Street Interim Hawker Centre on Monday, another lunchtime hot spot, Lau Pa Sat inTanjong Pagar, was almost empty. Some like Ms Shanas Ibrahim, 32, a sales assistant who works inTanjong Pagar, welcomes the return of work from home as the default so she can spend more time with her two-year-old. \"It is a win-win situation for me,\" Ms Shanas said. She has also stopped sending her elder daughter to pre-school as a precaution. Law firm OC Queen Street has allowed all its employees to work from home by default for over a year, and is already considering downsizing the office and keeping only meeting spaces once the lease expires next year. \"We are working towards an even better work-from-home arrangement,\" said Mr Koh Chia Ling, 50, the firm\\'s managing director. Similarly, many popular heartland malls - Nex, AMKHub, Compass One, Waterway Point and White Sands - The Straits Times visited were significantly less crowded than usual on Monday. The longest queues were of patrons taking away food, especially in basements of malls where most eateries are concentrated. Compulsory TraceTogether-only SafeEntry check-ins via the mobile app or token also kicked in on Monday. Most people in the malls had no issues checking in. Many were seen tapping their phones on the SafeEntry Gateway scanner, while others were using their TraceTogether app to scan a QR code. A few people tried to use their identification cards, which they could no longer use for checking in. The mall staff instead directed them to download the TraceTogether app. Following tighter restrictions that kicked in on Sunday that prohibit dining in at food and beverage outlets, tables and chairs were spotted neatly stacked at eateries. Some eateries had already seen their takings dip by up to half on Sunday. The busiest eateries had only about 10 patrons in line duringlunchtime. \"It used to be quite okay during lunch, but now that everyone is working from home, we just won\\'t see a crowd anymore,\" said Ms Camille Hasagawa, 31, supervisor at AMKHub\\'s The Pine Garden kiosk. Other retail stores across all malls visited by ST barely saw any customers. Sales assistant Lim Wei Xiang said that sales at Mobile Fashion, a mobile accessories store at Compass One in Sengkang, had fallen by about 70 per cent to 80 per cent compared witha week ago. Mr Sim Wei Bin, sales assistant at a shop selling video games at Tampines Mall, said: \"Before the measures tightened, we saw up to 20 customers in the store every hour.\" But on Sunday, with the new measures, its hourly footfall halved. But despite mandatory home-based learning (HBL) for all schools taking effect from Wednesdayto May 28, there seemed no last-minute dash for supplies or assessment books at bookstore chains like Popular in malls such as Compass One, Tampines Mall and Nex. Fewer than 10 shoppers at a time were spotted inside these outlets around lunchtime when ST visited. Housewife Intan Adzurah, who was getting lunch at Nex, said she is ready for HBL with her nine-year-old daughter Sayyidah Nafeesah. \"She\\'s the only child, so I\\'m not in a hurry (to stock up),\" said Ms Intan. On Monday, the Ministry of Health (MOH) started mandatory swabbing for staff and tenants of White Sands and the Giant supermarket outlet at Block 440 Pasir Ris Drive 4 as some visitors to these places had tested positive for Covid-19 over the last two weeks. While White Sands remained open to the public, it was mostly empty. A 61-year-old cashier at the Value Shop in White Sands, Ms Azimah Muhammad, said she went for her swab test to have peace of mind. Ms Loo Chia Hui, 24, who works at box concept store Cube Sprout selling a range of products including electronics, said the swab test at the mall was her second one. Replying to ST queries, the Singapore Retailers Association (SRA) said the Government should extend the Job Support Scheme to retailers. \"With this more dangerous (Covid-19) variant that\\'s going around,the work from home directive as a defaultand schools implementing home-based learning, there\\'s just no more traffic,\" said SRA executive director Rose Tong. \"Staying open doesn\\'t necessarily mean that they\\'re going to make money (when) there\\'s nobody in the malls.\" Additional reporting by Jason Quah Join ST\\'s Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.

       " {'text': 'singapores tighter covid 19 measures a blow to gym owners while organisers reschedule Read 3 articles daily and stand to win ST rewards, including the ST News Tablet worth $398. Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - Higher-risk settingssuch as indoor gyms and indoor fitness or health studios will be closed and mass participation events will be suspended from Saturday (May 8) to May 30 to minimise large Covid-19 cluster formation and reduce the risk of community transmission. No spectators will be allowed at sports events during this period. At a press conference on Tuesday, Education Minister Lawrence Wong, who co-chairs the multi-ministry task force (MTF) tackling the coronavirus pandemic in Singapore, announced stricter measures to stop the spread of Covid-19 in the wider community. He said: \"There are some settings which are of higher risk... typically where there is a high density of people who are unmasked and in close proximity with one another, often for prolonged periods.\" A good exampleof such settings would be indoor gyms and fitness studios, he added. The move comes as a blow for gym owners who previously had to cope with closures during the circuit breaker from April to June last year. Mr Koh See Khiang, 44, owner of five Anytime Fitness franchises, was \"bewildered\" by the announcement. He said: \"It\\'s not really clear to us why gyms have been singled out as high-risk. While I definitely appreciate the concerns around how people are working out in close proximity, I think the fitness industry in Singapore has proven that we\\'re able to manage the safety measures and keep everyone safe and there haven\\'t been many people getting infected in a gym setting as far as I know.\" Saying that this was \"out of the blue\", he added: \"Honestly it\\'s very difficult to plan without full visibility as to how long this would last. There\\'s not enough information in front of us to do any concrete planning yet.\" Gym goers like Ms Claire Siew, who has been an Anytime Fitness member since 2019 and visits the gym five to six times a week, was also disheartened by the news. While the 23-year-old accountant said she understood the rationale behind the move, she had hoped that patron numbers would be limited at gyms instead of a closure. She added: \"It is not easy to replicate all the exercises outside the gym without gym equipment. I have some dumbbells and weights which I will use, and I will run and do more workouts at home. They are not a perfect replacement, but it\\'s better than nothing.\" Mass participation sports events will also be called off during this period. The OCBC Cycle Speedway Championships on May 29 will be postponed until further notice, although its May 15-June 13 virtual rides will still continue. OCBC head of group brand and communications Koh Ching Ching said that \"all our cyclists will be reminded to ride safe and follow all safe management measures\". The National School Games, which kicked off in March, will be suspended \"to minimise intermingling of students across schools/institutions\", said the Ministry of Education. It will monitor the situation and explore resumption of the remaining competitions when conditions permit. Professional sports leagues and events like the Singapore Premier League (SPL) will be allowed to continue for now. The SPL\\'s two fixtures on Saturday will proceed, but the decision to allow up to 250 fans in stadiums to watch matches live - which commenced from April 10 - will now be rescinded. Calling this an \"unfortunate but necessary measure\", Football Association of Singapore general secretary Yazeen Buhari said: \"Given the recent circumstances, we have decided all SPL matches will be held without spectators indefinitely and will ensure our swab-tested players and officials strictly adhere to the safe management measures in place during match days.\" Lion City Sailors fan Jeremy Wong said: \"It\\'s disappointing because my friends and I have been enjoying recent SPL games at the stadiums, but the measures are understandable for the greater good and we will just make do with watching the games online.\" Similarly, it is understood that the One Championship Empower event that was scheduled to take place at the Singapore Indoor Stadium on May 28 will also be a closed-door event.

       " {'text': 'covid 19 cases put singapore on knife edge wong Read 3 articles daily and stand to win ST rewards, including the ST News Tablet worth $398. Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. Singapore is on a knife-edge, and the country\\'s Covid-19 community case numbers can go either way over the next few weeks, said Education Minister Lawrence Wong yesterday, as he urged people to continue observing safety measures and get vaccinated. \"We have a chance of getting things under control by the end of the month,\" he said. \"But as we know from experience, it only takes one lapse or one irresponsible action for an infection to spread; and that infection may end up being a super-spreader event in the community.\" His comments came amid a worrying increase in cases here, with 13 new community cases yesterday, 11 open clusters, and 12 unlinked cases in the past week. At least 10 different virus variants have infiltrated the Republic, and some of these could be driving infections here. Vaccines are key to ending the pandemic, Mr Wong stressed. With close to two million residents having received at least their first shot, vaccination will be extended to younger people from later this month, said Health Minister Gan Kim Yong, who co-chairs the multi-ministry task force on Covid-19 with Mr Wong. Both ministers were updating Parliament on the virus situation. In response to the increased infections, Singapore has tightened its borders and rules on social gatherings since last Saturday, a day before Mother\\'s Day, and ahead of Hari Raya Aidilfitri tomorrow and Vesak Day on May 26. Mr Wong acknowledged that the safety measures, which include tighter restrictions on social gatherings and household visits, will pose \"considerable inconvenience\". He said: \"I thank everyone for taking (the latest measures) in your stride and I seek your cooperation to abide by them - not just with the letter of the law, but also the spirit of it.\" About 1.8 million individuals here have received at least one dose of the vaccine as at Sunday, revealed Mr Gan. Of this number, about 1.2 million people have received their second and final dose. Also, two in three people who are aged 45 and older who are eligible for inoculation have received their shots, or booked their vaccination appointments. But this is not enough. \"Take-up has been encouraging... However, we need to continue to encourage more to be vaccinated, especially among the seniors. Given their age, they are the most vulnerable,\" Mr Gan said. While vaccines do not work 100 per cent, they nonetheless significantly reduce the chance of infection, he pointed out. He also said there have been 104 applications for financial assistance for those suffering from serious side effects related to the vaccines, as at May 3. Of these, 30 qualified for compensation, 45 applications were rejected and the remaining 29 are still pending. Mr Louis Ng (Nee Soon GRC) asked if the vaccine programme here can include children under 16. Initial information provided by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, whose vaccines are the only ones permitted here, did not include data regarding their use in younger populations, Mr Gan said. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was cleared for use by the United States Food and Drug Administration on Monday for children aged 12 to 15 on an emergency use basis. Singapore\\'s Health Sciences Authority is still assessing Pfizer-BioNTech\\'s data to decide if its vaccine is safe for adolescents here, and will do so with Moderna\\'s vaccine when data is submitted. \"We will share more details when the studies are completed. As for children below 12 years of age, clinical trials are still ongoing and may take more time before enough data is available,\" said Mr Gan. With the pandemic still raging in many parts of the world, the fight against Covid-19 will continue for a while yet, he said. \"Our response has not always been perfect. But we have built many new capabilities to meet the new challenges as they emerge,\" he said. \"This ability for all of us to strive together is the most critical element in our response to Covid-19 that will make all the difference in the eventual outcome.\" Join ST\\'s Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - Supermarkets and online grocers as well as food delivery services are opening up more slots and ramping up manpower, as online orders surged in the wake of tightened restrictions that kicked in a week ago on May 16. While they say it has become more manageable since the initial spike, they are still seeing more orders than before the phase two measures began. A spokesman for FairPrice supermarket chain said: \"Following the spike in shoppers observed at our physical stores on May 14 due to the announcement of phase two(heightened alert), demand from shoppers has since subsided, though we expect order volumes to remain elevated.\" Online grocery store RedMart, FairPrice andDairy Farm Group, which operates supermarket chains Giant and Cold Storage, said they have increased capacity and the number of slots released daily for deliveries. A Dairy Farm spokesman said: \"In preparation for the increase in customer demand, we have hired more manpower to ramp up our packing and delivery capacity and added more daily delivery slots. \"Our teams continue to work around the clock to keep our websites stable and fulfil all pending orders.\" A spokesman for RedMart said: \"The announcement of phase two (heightened alert) led to an initial peak demand with orders more than three times that of a normal day on RedMart, with a rush for delivery slots and familiar products being snapped up.\" The companies urged customers to be patient instead of panic buying, as they have sufficient stocks, with more coming in regularly. RedMart for instance, urged customers to shop responsibly and check back daily for replenished products. Dairy Farm has also partnered with Deliveroo for a grocery delivery service spanning 25 Cold Storage outlets and 30 Giant stores, allowing their customers to make purchases on the same day. \"These services provide our customers with more options and flexibility, especially during this period,\" said Dairy Farm. Meanwhile, food delivery platforms Deliveroo, Foodpanda and GrabFood say they have all seen an increase in deliveries in the past week. None disclosed any figures. Foodpanda said: \"Orders for foodas well as for groceries and other home essentials from Pandamart and Foodpanda shops have increased by almost half since we entered this phase.\" However, in some cases, the increased orders have not resulted in more work for delivery drivers and riders. Foodpanda rider Sandy Lee, 33, said her workload has decreased despite the rise in number of orders across the platform, due to factors such as a larger pool of riders since the tightened measures began, and comparatively less demand for orders in the area where sheworks. \"Right before the tightened measures, there was a spike in demand, perhaps due to Hari Raya celebrations, but in the last week orders have decreased for me,\" said Ms Lee, who has been a delivery rider for three years. Grab driver Jarrold Tham, 40, who also does freelance deliveryof food items and packages, said the circuit breaker fromApril to June last year\"was much better for deliveries and it was really busy, probably because it was the first time Singapore was going through something like that\". \"But now with the semi-lockdown and few people out, drivers are desperate for jobs,\" said Mr Tham, who at his peak last year was averaging deliveries worth $70 to $100 per day. Now he said he can barely make a $100 a week from deliveries. Beyond the dip in jobs, Mr Tham is also worried about the safety of his family. \"Honestly now I\\'m scared to drive also with the presence of the new Covid-19 variant and the number of cases going up every day... it\\'s a big fear as I\\'m planning for a family, and I don\\'t want my wife to get it,\" he added.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - Investors sold off Singapore stocks on Friday afternoon (May 14) after the Government tightened Covid-19 restrictions in response to a worrying increase in the number of community infections. The Straits Times Index closed down 2.2 per cent at 3,055.02 points, the lowest level since March 8. The selloff cut this year’s gain to 7.57 per cent, less than the 13.2 per cent the index had clocked in the first four months. From May 16 to June 13, dining in at restaurants and foodcourts will be prohibited and social gatherings will be limited to two people, Singapore\\'s multi-ministry task force (MTF) on Covid-19 said. Working from home will once again be the default and employers will have to ensure that staff who can work from home do so. A planned air travel bubble between Singapore and Hong Kong that was due to start on May 26 may be delayed further, the task force added in a press briefing, saying it is likely that Singapore will not be able to meet the criteria for it to go ahead. This would be the second postponement of the travel bubble, after it was deferred last November following a spike in infections in Hong Kong. The news sent the shares of Singapore Airlines skidding, with the stock closing down 5.7 per cent at $4.50, with 28 million shares traded. Ground-handler and in-flight caterer Sats lost 3.9 per cent to close at $3.69. Shares of supermarket chain Sheng Siong, however, jumped by 10.7 per cent to $1.66, as long supermarket queues made their reappearance islandwide. Mr Yu Liuqing, country analyst at The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) said that tightened social restrictions will effectively freeze the recovery of private consumption in the short term. However, he noted, disruption to businesses will be less pronounced than last year’s circuit breaker period as businesses have adapted to working from home and will continue to support to the overall economic recovery. “Singapore’s economic growth will not see another contraction unless the circuit breaker is reactivated for a prolonged period of time,” Mr Yu said. Strong contact tracing capacity will help the authorities to stop the spread quickly, and the vaccination programme will lead to the restrictions being removed soon enough, he added. Speaking at a virtual press conference, Education Minister Lawrence Wong, who is also the MTF co-chair, said: \"I think the businesses that will be the hardest hit will be the food and beverage (F&B) sector,because of the restriction for dining in.\" In view of this, the Government will raise its wage support for F&B establishments to 50 per cent, up from 10 per cent, under the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS). This will apply tothe first $4,600 of gross monthly wages paid to local employees. The increase in support will be applicable during the period for which dining in is prohibited. To support hawkers and coffeeshop stallholders, who are self-employed and do not benefit from the JSS, the Government will provide one month of rental waiverfor hawker stall and coffeeshop tenants of Government agencies. Mr Wong urged commercial landlords to support their F&B tenants. READ NEXT: What are the new Covid-19 rules in S\\'pore from May 16?

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - There were 16 cases of Covid-19 infection confirmed on Wednesday (May 12), 10 of which are community cases and the other six imported ones. Of the community cases, seven are linked to the Changi Airport cluster. This brings the total number of patients in the cluster to 25, forming the second-largest active cluster after the one at Tan Tock Seng Hospital which has 44 cases. Members of the public who had visited Changi Airport Terminal 3 since May 3 will be offered free Covid-19 testing, MOH said on Wednesday night. \"MOH will progressively inform these individuals via SMS notification with information on how to book an appointment for their test,\" it added. The sole unlinked case is another hospital worker - this time at Sengkang General Hospital. He is a 33-year-old operating theatre nurse who had received both doses of the Covid-19 vaccine. He has preliminarily tested positive for the B1617 variant of the virus first identified in India. Three of the seven new cases linked to the Changi Airport cluster have also preliminarily tested positive for the B1617 variant. They are a 39-year-old man and a 38-year-old woman, who both work as Immigration and Checkpoints Authority officers at Terminal 3, and a 65-year-old cleaner employed by Ramky Cleantech Services, also working in Terminal 3. Five of the seven are fully vaccinated. The remaining cases comprise another cleaner - a 62-year-old - also employed by Ramky CleanTech Services, a 24-year-old employed by Huawei Enterprise as an IT engineer at Terminal 4, a 28-year-old employed by Certis Cisco at Terminal 3 and a 42-year-old sales associate at a retail store at Terminal 3. They are all men. The other two community cases were linked to other clusters. The first is a 36-year-old Vietnamese woman who is a short-term visit pass holder. She is a household contact of the Grab driver who was confirmed to have Covid-19 last Saturday - prompting the designation of a new cluster. This brings Singapore’s total number of active clusters to 12. The last community case is a 64-year-old Singaporean woman who had been warded at Tan Tock Seng Hospital\\'s Ward 9D. Her Covid-19 test on Tuesday while under quarantine returned positive. She had previously tested negative on April 26, April 28 and April 30. MOH said the six imported cases had been placed on stay-home notice. The new cases take Singapore\\'s total tally to 61,419. The number of new cases in the community has decreased from 62 cases two weeks ago to 49 in the past week. However, the number of unlinked cases in the community in a week has increased from seven cases to 12 over the same period. With 31 cases discharged on Wednesday, 60,991 patients have fully recovered from the disease. A total of 143 patients remain in hospital, including three in critical condition in the intensive care unit, while 239 are recuperating in community facilities. Singapore has had 31 deaths from Covid-19 complications, while 15 who tested positive have died of other causes. <!--//--><![CDATA[// ><!--iFrameResize()//--><!]]> Join ST\\'s Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. The death of a 57-year-old man the day after he took his first Covid-19 jab on March 5 was due to a heart attack, and not linked to the vaccine, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said yesterday. In response to queries from The Straits Times, MOH said it was alerted on March 8 by the National University Hospital (NUH) to the death of the Singaporean patient, who had been treated at the hospital\\'s emergency medicine department on the evening of March 6. He had received his first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine on March 5. \"Based on the assessment by an independent clinical panel, there is no indication that the death was due to Covid-19 vaccination,\" said MOH. The ministry added that the certified cause of death was a heart attack, and the man had a history of hypertension and diabetes. MOH said the man was assessed by trained healthcare personnel to be suitable for vaccination, and he was observed on-site for about 30 minutes after getting the shot. \"We offer our sincere condolences to the family during this difficult time,\" the ministry added. MOH said that to date, there has not been any deaths in Singapore assessed to be caused by the Covid-19 vaccine. Online news outlet Today reported on Sunday that the man, named Yak Hock Hwa, a private-hire car driver, collapsed in the evening of March 6. NUH told Today that the man\\'s condition deteriorated rapidly and he did not respond to resuscitation efforts. The man\\'s family told Today that he had no history of heart problems, and they are hoping that the authorities can provide further explanations on how they assessed that his death was not caused by the vaccine. They are also hoping to receive compensation from the Vaccine Injury Financial Assistance Programme - a one-time goodwill payout for those who suffer from serious side effects linked to the vaccine. The news outlet also reported that the family declined an autopsy into his death because the NUH doctors were confident that the man died of a heart attack. The man\\'s daughter had also asked that an autopsy not be done. Join ST\\'s Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.

SINGAPORE - One new community case linked to the Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) cluster has been reported on Friday (May 14). The patient was in quarantine when the case was detected, said the Health Ministry\\'s director of medical services, Associate Professor Kenneth Mak, at a press conference by the multi-ministry task force tackling Covid-19. No cases outside the quarantine net for the cluster associated with Ward 9D were detected. Ward 9D, a C class ward with 35 to 40 patients, is the nucleus of the outbreak. About two-thirds of the patients in this ward contracted Covid-19 while being treated for other conditions. There were 44 cases linked to the cluster on Thursday night, according to the Ministry of Health (MOH). Prof Mak said the TTSH cluster is reaching an incubation period. \"If we continue to not see any cases, we will see how we can bring the hospital to normal operations progressively in the next few weeks.\" More details on the case will be released on Friday evening. The TTSH cluster is Singapore\\'s first hospital cluster. It comprises staff, patients and their close contacts. Close to 28,000 people have been tested in the effort to detect cases linked to it, said Health Minister Gan Kim Yong, who co-chairs the task force. The cluster emerged on April 27 following the diagnosis of a nurse who works in Ward 9D, a general ward. Prior to Friday\\'s case, the last addition to the cluster was a 64-year-old Singaporean woman who was warded at Ward 9D from April 26 and moved to the National Centre for Infectious Diseaseson April 28. She was identified as a close contact of a previous case and placed on quarantine on April 29. The woman was discharged on May 2 and continued to be on quarantine. She tested positive for Covid-19 on May 11 during quarantine. READ NEXT: What are the new Covid-19 rules in S\\'pore from May 16?

       " {'text': 'askst confused about the restrictions heres what you can and cannot do Read 3 articles daily and stand to win ST rewards, including the ST News Tablet worth $398. Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - With Singapore set to enter a new wave of restrictions from Sunday (May 16), much confusion surrounds the \"rule of two\". The Straits Times answers questions on what you can and cannot do. Q: Can members of the same household go out in groups of more than two people? A: Yes, family members living together can go out as one group to do essential activities, such as to attend school or for medical appointments. They can also go out together as a family unit to take care of their elderly relatives, such as their grandparents, said Health Minister Ong Ye Kung in a Facebook post on Saturday. He added that for grocery shopping, however, they should try to keep this to two family members only, to minimise the family’s exposure to the virus. The Health Ministry (MOH) said it recognises that there may also be occasions when members of the same household may need to move around in groups larger than two, especially those with young children or elderly parents. When members of the same household may need to move about in groups larger than two, they should bring along proof of identity such as NRICs to facilitate the checking of particulars by enforcement officers and safe distancing ambassadors, who will be patrolling public spaces. As such, the ministry is prepared to be flexible in its implementation of the general rule for such bona fide cases. However, households are strongly urged to observe the prevailing group size limits in public settings and venues as far as possible. Q:Can two people eat outside of home in a public place, such as at the beach, the park or even the void deck? Are picnics allowed? What about people like food delivery personnel who may not have anywhere to eat? A: While the consumption of food and drinks at public spaces, like parks, is not prohibited, this should be done in instances when it would be inconvenient to return to the home or workplace to eat. In such cases, members of the public or workers should avoid crowded spaces and minimise social interactions, including maintaining safe distancing at all times. Q: Can my parents continue to come over to my place to take care of my children, and can I send my children to their place as well? A: Yes, you can continue to do so, said Mr Ong. He added that families who require childcare support can get the grandparents to go over to help, but they should keep to a cap of two visitors per household per day. Parents can also send their children to their grandparents’ place, without worrying about the visitor cap, he added. Individuals should continue to limit their total number of social gatherings to no more than two a day, whether it is to another household, or meeting friends and family members in a public place. Q: My wedding will be held on Sunday, the first day the new rules kick in. It is too late to make last-minute arrangements. Will it still be allowed to proceed? A: A special exception will be made for wedding receptions on Sunday to proceed. However, this is subject to the conditions that only up to 100 attendees are allowed and that all unvaccinated attendees must undergo pre-event testing. Q: Are there any changes to the solemnisation guidelines if it is done at the Registry of Marriages building? A: A maximum of 10 people, including the bride and groom, are allowed for solemnisations in the Registry of Marriages and Registry of Muslim Marriages buildings. For solemnisations held in a place of residence, a maximum of 10 people are allowed, including the bride and groom. This number is not inclusive of the solemniser and other vendors. For solemnisations in other venues, the capacity limit is 100 people, or the safe capacity of the venue, whichever is lower. This is down from the previous cap of 250 people. If there are between 51 and 100 attendees, pre-event testing is required for all unvaccinated attendees. Q: Will there be any limit onhair services, such as hair treatments that may take a couple of hours? A: There is no time limit for hair services, but masks must be worn by customers and staff at all times. Customers can enter the premises only 10 minutes prior to the start of their appointment session and should refrain from mingling with other customers or staff. All safe management measures should be strictly adhered to. Q: Can I proceed with my booked staycation if it is more than two people? Can a family of three who have booked a staycation before June 13 still be allowed to go ahead? A: Only two guests are allowed per room, except where individuals are all from the same household. No dining in is allowed at hotel food and beverage (F&B) establishments. Those with hotel bookings between May 16 and June 13 may change their booking dates or request a refund, subject to terms and conditions. Those who have used their SingapoRediscovers vouchers for hotel bookings during the period can have the vouchers refunded. Q: Can I go out to cycle, swim or run? A: Yes, you can swim outdoors alone or in a group of no more than two people, including yourself. The same rule applies for running and cycling. Q: Can I exercise outdoors with my family if there are more than two of us, like take a walk in the park together? A: Yes, you can. However you should split into pairs and maintain safe distancing between individuals (2m) and different groups (3m) while exercising. Q: Will indoor sports halls still be open if it involves games between just two people? A: Indoor facilities, including gyms, fitness studios, sports halls, indoor swimming pools and squash courts will continue to be closed from May 8 to June 13, unless they offer only low-intensity physical activities where the participants and instructors can be masked at all times. There will also be no sharing or supplying of common equipment. Some examples of these activities are yoga, pilates, and tai chi. Q: Will there still be outdoor sports programmes and classes for large groups? A: Yes. However, the activity must be of low intensity with masks on at all times.Multiple groups of two are allowed to join in, but there is a capacity limit of 30 participants or capacity limit of the venue, whichever is lower. The groups are not to intermingle and must remain 3m apart. If the activity is of high intensity where masks have to be removed, only two people will be allowed, including the instructor or the coach. Multiple groups of two will not be allowed. Q: Can I still play sports like badminton, basketball and table tennis? A: Yes, but only in a group of no more than two people (that is, two individuals playing against each other). Masks must be worn at all times when playing indoors, though they can be taken off during strenuous outdoor activities. Q: Will students be allowed to eat in the canteen, since dining in is not allowed? A: Yes they can, but the schools will enforce a fixed seating plan with 1m spacing during recess time, with no intermingling. Q: Employers must ensure that no more than 50 per cent of employees who can work from home return to the workplaces at any time - does this still hold? A: No. Safe management measures at the workplaces will be tightened. Employers must ensure that all employees who are able to work from home do so. Previously, up to 50 per cent of employees who are able to work from home could be at the workplaces at any time. Q: Will photo shoots/productions that involve more than two be allowed? A: From May 16 to June 13, media content production companies may proceed with the default of up to 15 crew or talents on location, including no more than 10 onscreen talents who may unmask if necessary. All productions should not have audiences on site and safe distancing of 1m has to be strictly adhered to at all times. The guidelines are also applicable for photo shoots. Q: Are home renovation works and construction projects allowed to continue from May 16 to June 13? A: Yes, they are allowed. However, if there are people residing within the household where the works or services are carried out, there should not be more than two workers allowed per day. Q: Can more than two people share a taxi or private-hire car if they are from different households? A: Taxis and private-hire cars can take more than two passengers only if they are all from the same household.Passengers from different households have to keep to the two-passenger limit.

       " {'text': 'askst what is a double mutant covid 19 variant and should i be worried Read 3 articles daily and stand to win ST rewards, including the ST News Tablet worth $398. Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - India\\'s devastating second Covid-19 wave has cast the spotlight on a new \"double-mutant\" variant called B1617. The Straits Times answers some questions surrounding mutations and variants that were raised in our monthly webinar a week ago. The webinar, Season Two of Covid-19: Updates From Singapore, brought together local and international experts to discuss the latest medical and scientific findings regarding the coronavirus. A: A mutation is a change that occurs in the genetic material. Mutations arise when the genetic material is not copied precisely as the virus replicates during cell division. A:It is true that the B1617 has two spike protein mutations, namely E484Q and L452R, but in reality, B1617 contains a total of 13 spike protein mutations. The name \"double mutant\" is just a name to refer to those two mutations and does not mean anything scientifically. A:It is not new, as the genome sequence of B1617 was first uploaded onto the Global Initiative on Sharing all Influenza Data (Gisaid), a platform which promotes the international sharing of all influenza virus sequences, in October 2020. Prior to the massive surge in Covid-19 cases in India, this variant was also detected in the United States and Britain at the end of February 2021. A:The B1617 variant cannot be ignored, but such outbreaks are multifactorial in nature and cannot be blamed just on the variant. The surge in cases in India occurred at a time where over 98 per cent of India\\'s population have not received the full dose of the vaccine. This means many people are at risk of infection. Other possible contributory factors may include mass gatherings, relaxation of social distancing measures, and limited testing capacity. A surge in cases could also result in more variants, giving the virus greater chances of survival. If the genetic material of the virus is not copied precisely when it replicates, a mutation is the result. As more people get infected, the more the virus replicates, the higher the probability of mutations. A:Some of these mutations have been beneficial to the virus. For instance, the N501Y mutation present in Britain\\'s B117, South Africa\\'s B1351 and Brazil\\'s P1 strain allows for the virus to bind nine times more strongly to the ACE2 receptor. ACE2 is a protein on the surface of many cell types that helps the coronavirus get into cells. This will lead to more efficient transmission of the virus. The L452R mutation, which is present in the variant initially identified in India, increases binding to the ACE2 receptor and also helps the virus to escape neutralising antibodies. In theory, there will only be a certain number of mutations that will be beneficial to the virus. Hence, the repeated mutations independently developing across the different variants will be the ones that make the virus more efficacious and viable. If true, then only one or two more vaccine versions may be needed to protect us against these variants. <!--//--><![CDATA[// ><!--iFrameResize()//--><!]]> Following recent guidelines from the United States\\' Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that mask wearing outdoors for fully vaccinated individuals can be relaxed, The Straits Times spoke with infectious diseases experts on whether mask-wearing habits will need to be changed in Singapore. Associate Professor Hsu Li Yang from the National University of Singapore\\'s Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health said that real-world data has shown that a small proportion of people who have received both shots of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines can still be infected and potentially pass the virus to others. Hence, he believes that mask wearing should still be encouraged. Explaining the rationale behind relaxing these mask-wearing measures, President Joe Biden said that the odds of transmitting the virus when one is both outdoors and fully vaccinated are \"very, very low\". This is because fresh air can disperse and help to evaporate the respiratory droplets which may contain the Sars-CoV-2 virus. For instance, vaccinated individuals can exercise outdoors with their family members and attend small outdoor gatherings with both vaccinated and unvaccinated people. A: No, as long as you ensure that you have a good triple-layermask that properly covers your nose and mouth. Infectious disease expert Leong Hoe Nam said that mask wearing is an effective physical barrier against the virus transmitting. \"The (virus) mutants don\\'t change that,\" he said. Dr Leong highlighted the importance of complying with mask-wearing measures, and to ensure that one has an effective mask rather than double-masking. If one is already conscientious in mask wearing, there is no need to wear multiple masks concurrently, said Professor Teo Yik Ying, dean of the National University of Singapore\\'s Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health. \"The current situation in Singapore, especially in the community, also remains one that is well under control, and that means as long as we keep up with the mask wearing, social distancing, and the restrictions on large gatherings beyond eight people, there is no need to be overly concerned with wearing more than one mask,\" he said.

       " {'text': 'hotels wedding venues help couples adapt to new rules Read 3 articles daily and stand to win ST rewards, including the ST News Tablet worth $398. Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - From offering refunds to absorbing the costs of pre-event testing, hotels and wedding venues have been working to help couples adapt to the sudden restrictions announced on Tuesday (May 4) and which kicked in this weekend. For weddings this month, Fairmont Singapore will pay the cost of pre-event testing for Covid-19, if couples want to go ahead with more than 50 people, said Ms Kerry Healy, chief commercial officer of hotel operator Accor for South-east Asia, Japan and South Korea. Mandarin Oriental Singapore and Italian restaurant Monti will also absorb a portion of the pre-event testing costs for weddings this month. Mandarin Oriental will be absorbing 50 per cent of the costs, and offer that for weddings next month as well. Food and beverage business 1-Group, which manages Monti, did not reveal what proportion of the cost it will absorb. Other hotels will be offering refunds to couples who have made full payment for weddings that were meant to have more than 50 people attending. These include Grand Hyatt Singapore, which will refund those who have made full payment for a 100-person arrangement and are choosing to go ahead with their wedding with a reduced guest list of 50 instead, said Ms June Choong, the hotel\\'s director of events. The Fullerton Hotel Singapore and The Fullerton Bay Hotel Singapore will allow couples to downsize their guest list without incurring any penalty, or to postpone their wedding if the venue is available, said general manager Cavaliere Giovanni Viterale of The Fullerton Hotels and Resorts. Since Saturday, the capacity for marriage solemnisation gatherings and wedding receptions was reduced to 50 people without pre-event testing, down from 100. The restrictions have been imposed till May 30. Despite the sudden limitations, about 70 per cent of couples have decided to go ahead with weddings scheduled from May 8 to May 30, said Accor\\'s Ms Healy. Accor is the largest hotel operator here, managing 27 hotels. 1-Group said about 60 per cent of couples with weddings this month have decided to stick to their schedules, while the rest are considering postponing. It manages eight wedding venues, includingMonti. Many couples are still deciding whether they want to have more than 50 people present, as pre-event testing could be logistically complex, said the hotels and wedding venues. Guests may also be reluctant to go for the tests, they added. Some hotels are coming up with new arrangements to allow for these tests to be conducted on site. Mr Viterale said The Fullerton Hotels and Resorts is working with a healthcare service provider to list The Fullerton Hotel Singapore as an approved venue for pre-event testing. The test would cost less than $30 a person, he said. The Sunday Times understands that most tests cost about $50, though they can be as low as $20. Guests attending weddings at Fairmont Singapore can be swabbed at Raffles City Convention Centre, an official vaccination centre located near the hotel. At the Raffles City centre, healthcare provider Fullerton Healthcare will be able to conduct on-site pre-event testing for Fairmont, said Ms Healy. This will be done just before the event. Guests will get the result of the test - an antigen rapid test that involves a nasal swab - within 30 minutes. Having a test site that is close to the venue will help ensure that testing requirements are clearly communicated to the guests and that test results are accurately verified, added Ms Healy. Mandarin Oriental also has an on-site facility for pre-event testing. Results can be processed in about 15 minutes, said Kingston Medical Group, which is administering the tests at the hotel. A couple, who wanted to be known only as Mr and Mrs Leow, held their wedding reception at a Chinese restaurant on Saturday. Their reception, which had been postponed from October last year, was initially planned for 100 people. When the new rules were announced on Tuesday, they had to rush to make alternative arrangements. While they considered having pre-event testing, some guests were not comfortable with going for a swab test. In the end, the couple decided to scale down their guest list, and go ahead with a reception for 50 people. The restaurant, which they declined to name, was unable to offer a refund for the scaled-down guest list as ingredients for the wedding lunch had already been ordered, though it offered to deliver the meals to the remaining 50 guests who could not attend the wedding. But the couple, who work in IT, rejected the offer as it would be too logistically complex to coordinate food deliveries. \"Though we felt it was not fair that we could not get any compensation, we felt there was no point arguing over this - we just wanted to move on,\" said Mrs Leow, 28.

       " {'text': 'children not more prone to current virus strains experts Read 3 articles daily and stand to win ST rewards, including the ST News Tablet worth $398. Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. There is little to suggest that the coronavirus strains currently circulating are more likely to infect children, experts said, even as more than 40 students and pupils from about 30 schools have come down with Covid-19 in the past month. The reason so many children have been infected, said infectious diseases expert Paul Tambyah, is the environment where most of the cases involving them originated - a tuition centre. It has become the epicentre of a large cluster, said Professor Tambyah, deputy director of the National University of Singapore\\'s (NUS) Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine\\'s Infectious Diseases Translational Research Programme. The Learning Point tuition centre cluster had 28 cases as at Friday. On that same day, Singapore reported its first incident of school-based transmission. However, current evidence does not point to children being more likely to be infected with the B1617 variant that was first detected in India, compared with the original strain. Official data from the Press Trust of India news agency suggests that the proportion of children infected during the first and second waves of the pandemic in India is similar, Prof Tambyah said. Associate Professor Sylvie Alonso, co-director of the Infectious Diseases Translational Research Programme, said more aggressive testing among the younger age group could also be a reason for more cases surfacing. \"We seem to also see that the B1617 variant is overall more transmissible than the previous variants - across all age groups - thus affecting more children as well,\" she added. Associate Professor Hsu Li Yang, vice-dean of global health at the NUS Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, said the risk of severe disease for those under the age of 18 is much lower than for adults. \"Babies under one and children with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes and chronic lung disease may be more likely to get severe Covid-19, but generally, those under the age of 18 are far less likely to get severe Covid-19 compared with adults,\" he said. There is, however, a very rare and serious condition, known as multisystem inflammatory syndrome - a condition where different parts of the body can become inflamed. Babies under one and children with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes and chronic lung disease may be more likely to get severe Covid-19, but generally, those under the age of 18 are far less likely to get severe Covid-19 compared with adults. It is seen only in children and is associated with Covid-19 infection, but Singapore has yet to see a case, Prof Hsu said. Children under the age of 12 are also less likely to get infected, he added. Still, children remain a weak link in Singapore\\'s fight against Covid-19. Young children tend not to be able to wear masks or observe safe distancing measures well, Prof Hsu said. \"So, even though they are individually less at risk of serious illness or spreading the virus, collectively, the risk will add up - particularly at tuition centres and other enrichment classes and play locations, where children from multiple schools typically congregate,\" he added. Prof Alonso said children who are infected can also be carriers and transmitters of the virus without realising it, because they will be mostly asymptomatic. She added that this would be a concern if they transmit the virus to vulnerable people in their households who could develop a severe form of the disease. Prof Tambyah said: \"Thus, the idea of vaccinating this age group is that it is a way to protect the vulnerable.\" The Health Sciences Authority last Tuesday extended its authorisation for those aged 12 to 15 to receive the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. The Health and Education ministries will announce at a later date when Covid-19 vaccination will be extended to this age group.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. Eleven companies have been fined for failing to get their employees to work from home. They were caught during inspections conducted by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM). More than 530 workplaces were inspected between May 8 and last Friday. Offenders will be fined $1,000, with the amount rising to $2,000 for repeat breaches. All employees who are able to work from home must do so, under the latest advisory for safe management measures issued on May 14, MOM said in a statement yesterday. Only employees who are unable to work from home owing to the nature of their work - such as those who need to access equipment housed in the workplace - can continue to work on-site, said the ministry. All employers who carry out operations on-site must declare the number of workers they have at the workplace. They are required by the Ministry of Trade and Industry to do this by Friday, and must update the ministry when there are significant changes. \"Regardless of the declared number of workers, it is the employer\\'s responsibility to ensure that all employees work from home if they are able to do so,\" said MOM. MOM will penalise employers if staff who can work from home are found on-site, even if they do not exceed the maximum number allowed at the workplace. Some employees told The Straits Times that their companies have been resistant to the new restrictions. An employee of a branding agency who wanted to be known only as Ms Callie, 25, said her employers had insisted that staff return to the office last week despite the new guidelines. The company reversed its decision last Thursday. She said that her employers had initially said she and her co-workers had to return as they were essential workers. \"My colleagues and I were quite angry because we think it is dangerous for us to go to work every day and potentially bring the virus back to vulnerable family members - one of them has a kid and another lives with her grandmother,\" she said, referring to the virus that causes Covid-19. She said her work, which involves mainly research, can be done from home. An events company employee, who wanted to be known only as Ms Ye, 40, is still required by her employers to go to the office. She is worried about being exposed to the virus, especially as there are new strains of it and higher daily Covid-19 case numbers. \"I would think commuting to work should be avoided at all costs for now,\" she said. \"My colleagues and I can be just as effective from home in our line of work.\" In February, about 140 companies were told to stop on-site operations after serious breaches of Covid-19 workplace safety rules. MOM said in a Facebook post on Feb 6 that more than 280 companies had been fined from March last year to February this year. January saw the formation of two Covid-19 workplace clusters - one at Golden Bridge Foods Manufacturing in Senoko and another at BS Industrial and Construction Supply in Kallang. Golden Bridge\\'s cluster had three Covid-19 cases linked to it - two co-workers and the wife of one of them - while BS Industrial\\'s had eight cases - six employees, one spouse and a housemate. MOM also said employers must ensure that adequate safe management measures are in place at all times for employees who are on-site. These include: • Staggering start times and allowing flexible workplace hours; • No cross-deployment across workplaces or worksites; • No social gatherings at work; • Meal breaks must be taken alone and at staggered time; and • Masks must be worn at the workplace at all times. MOM said it would be increasing its inspections to ensure that the latest guidelines are followed.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. A fully vaccinated woman who was working as a cleaner at a community care facility in Tuas South was the sole unlinked case out of the 16 community cases announced by the Ministry of Health (MOH) on Thursday (April 29). The 39-year-old Vietnamese national dons full personal protective equipment while at work - including an N95 mask, face shield, gown and gloves. She also periodically helps out at a food stall at The Summit located at the National University of Singapore's Bukit Timah campus. She received her first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine on Jan 27, and the second dose on Feb 19. MOH said that while the Covid-19 vaccine is effective in preventing symptomatic disease for the vast majority of those vaccinated, it is possible for vaccinated individuals to get infected. The woman had been asymptomatic, but her case was picked up when she was tested on Monday as part of rostered routine testing, MOH said. Her pooled test result came back positive for Covid-19 the next day, and she was taken by ambulance to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases. An individual test was done on Tuesday and her test result came back positive for Covid-19 infection. Her earlier tests from the routine screening - the last being on April 14 - were all negative for Covid-19 infection, the ministry added. The other 15 community cases announced by MOH on Thursday were linked to existing clusters. Eight of them - two staff and six patients - were linked to the nurse at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) who was working at Ward 9D, a general ward. These cases had mainly been detected by MOH's proactive testing of patients and staff in the affected ward. Measures have been put in place at the hospital to prevent further transmission, including barring visitors from entering the hospital except for critically ill patients. The other seven community cases were family members of a prior Covid-19 case - a 38-year-old Immigration and Checkpoints Authority officer - that MOH had announced on Wednesday. The ministry said that the man and his family had gathered for a meal on Sunday, when the transmission was likely to have taken place. MOH also reported 19 imported cases on Thursday, including two Singaporeans and nine permanent residents. There are also three dependant's pass holders and five work permit holders, including a foreign domestic worker. All had been placed on stay-home notice upon arrival in Singapore and were tested while serving it. There are currently 110 confirmed cases who are still in hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and none is in the intensive care unit. <!--//--><![CDATA[// ><!--iFrameResize()//--><!]]> <!--//--><![CDATA[// ><!--iFrameResize()//--><!]]> Join ST's Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) has clarified concerns raised by an employer of a foreign domestic worker who had been released early from stay-home notice (SHN) despite carrying the Covid-19 virus. MOM said in a Facebook post on May 17 that the Indonesian maid, who arrived on April 11 and cleared a Covid-19 test before her discharge from SHN two days later, had been tested again on April 30 out of caution amid the worsening Covid-19 situation. Although she tested positive, there were indications that she was shedding dead viral fragments from an old infection, MOM said. The domestic worker had earlier been assessed to be safe because she tested negative on her first polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test and positive on her serology test, indicating she had recovered from an earlier infection. Her employer, Jade Rasif, had raised concerns in Facebook and Instagram posts about whether it was safe for the domestic worker to be released on the third day of her SHN. The DJ also questioned why she had not been quarantined despite being in contact with the domestic worker. In the post on Facebook, MOM said the maid was confirmed to be no longer infectious and was discharged on May 9. \"This finding is consistent with the earlier determination of the migrant domestic worker as recovered from an old infection when she first entered Singapore,\" it added. \"The migrant domestic worker had not posed a risk to the employer\\'s family.\" In her post on social media, Ms Rasif also said she and her family members had gone for voluntary swab tests, stayed home and wore N95 masks at home as a precautionary measure. On the issue of why the domestic worker did not have a case number, MOM said only active Covid-19 infections required case numbers, and those still under clinical assessment did not require case numbers. On Monday (May 17), Ms Rasif responded to MOM\\'s post in a Facebook comment, noting that there were other families in similar situations who had been placed on SHN. \"I hope you can reach out to me and provide this clear explanation to the affected parties,\" she wrote. Several maid agencies The Straits Times spoke to said that some employers of domestic workers had - over the past two to three weeks - received emails from MOM saying that their domestic workers had to be swabbed again. These domestic workers were those that had been discharged only after a few days of SHN, said maid agencies. Some had tested positive and were put into isolation. ST has contacted MOM for comment.

       " {'text': 'temporary curbs will not derail singapores recovery say economists Read 3 articles daily and stand to win ST rewards, including the ST News Tablet worth $398. Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - A new wave of Covid-19 in Singapore may have dented investor sentiment but economic damage will depend on how long the renewed mobility curbs last, analysts said. A rise in local cases, since the recent discovery of a cluster at Tan Tock Seng Hospital,some infected with a variant of the coronavirus identified in India, has dragged the local stock market\\'s benchmark Straits Times Index down to its lowest levels in about six weeks. Reflecting the concern among investors, the bourse had its fourth consecutive day of losses after the Government on Tuesday (May 4) evening decided to implement for three weeks measures to restrict social mobility - effectively ending phase three of the reopening of the economyafter just four months. The STI closed 0.8 per cent down at 3,153.59 on Wednesday with Singapore Airlines and ComfortDelGro among the decliners. This is the lowest level since March 25, when the index ended at 3,141.71. The curbs will have a negative impact in the near term on retail mall real estate investment trusts such as Mapletree Commercial Trust, Lendlease, Starhill, Frasers Centrepoint Trust, and leisure firms like Genting, said DBS Bank in a note on Wednesday. However, stocks in supermarket operator Sheng Siong and food producer Dairy Farm will rise as they are seen as beneficiaries of the mobility restrictions, it added. Education MinisterLawrenceWong, who will be Singapore’s next finance minister, warned that the Government would not hesitate to take even more stringent measures and did not rule out another circuit breaker like the one that sent the economy into a record recession last year. But Mr Wong balanced his warnings by describing the latest measures as \"an additional pre-emptive step\" that was expected to bring the situation under control by end-May. The stock market may remain volatile as investors switch their bets from vulnerable companies in the transport and retail segments to beneficiaries in sectors such as healthcare, supermarkets and food producers. But, barring the re-imposition of a strict circuit breaker, most economists believe the economic damage will be limited. Mr Euben Paracuelles, economist at Nomura International, said the impact from the latest curbs would depend on their duration and whether they are tightened further. \"We think these risks are mitigated in part by stronger contact tracing, testing and ring-fencing capabilities,\" he said. Mr Paracuelles said there are also other mitigating economic factors. \"We think household consumption and, in turn, retail trade sectors should be more resilient, as consumers have adopted these restrictions and resorted to more online purchases, minimising the disruption,\" he noted. Singapore\\'s economic growth is highly dependent on its export industries - mainly grouped under manufacturing - which are likely to thrive as long as the country\\'s key trading partners maintain their growth trajectories. Mr Barnabas Gan, economist at UOB Group, said high-frequency data such as manufacturing and non-oil domestic exports supported the positive outlook. \"While outward-facing industries are expected to perform well on the back of a global recovery, the construction and services industries may continue to see headwinds on Covid-19 risks,\" he said. The uneven recovery has been flagged by both the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) and the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). MTI has maintained its projection of 4 per cent to 6 per cent gross domestic product growth for this year, a steep rebound from the record 5.4 per cent contraction last year. MAS has in fact indicated that growth may breach the higher end of MTI\\'s forecast. MAS also cited some evidence, based on its econometric analysis across countries in its April Macroeconomic Review, that the negative relationship between mobility restrictions and economic activity has weakened. Nomura\\'s Mr Paracuelles said that manufacturing, led by electronics and pharmaceuticals output, driven by improving external demand, would continue to strengthen. Nomura will maintain for now its 2021 GDP growth forecast for a strong rebound to 7.5 per cent in the whole of this year. Mr Gan of UOB said his 2021 forecast also remains unchanged, at 5.5 per cent. Ms Selena Ling, OCBC Bank\\'s chief economist, said she would keep her forecast at 6 per cent, as the latest curbs are likely to be a temporary setback.

Of the 10 cases, five are linked to previous cases and had already been placed under quarantine. This takes Singapore's total number of cases to 61,359. The other 18 cases were imported. They had been placed on stay-home notice (SHN) or isolated on arrival from Singapore, said the Ministry of Health (MOH). Among them were 11 Singaporeans or permanent residents. There were no cases from the workers' dormitories. More details will be announced on Sunday night. On Saturday, three men working at Changi Airport were among seven new Covid-19 community cases reported. As a precaution, MOH said it will test all staff working at Changi Airport Terminal 1 and Terminal 3, and Jewel. The first case is a 57-year-old aviation officer who screens departing and transiting passengers at Changi Airport Terminals 1 and 3. The Singaporean was tested for Covid-19 as part of rostered routine testing (RRT) last Wednesday and developed a sore throat in the evening but did not seek medical treatment, said MOH. He went to work the next day, and his sore throat worsened. Last Friday, his pooled test result came back positive and an individual swab taken also tested positive on the same day. His earlier tests from RRT - the last being on April 23 - were all negative for the virus. His serology test result is pending, said MOH. The second case is a 47-year-old cleaner who works for Ramky Cleantech Services and was deployed at Changi Airport Terminal 3. The work permit holder is asymptomatic and was detected as part of RRT last Wednesday. He was taken to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) where an individual test was done. His test result came back positive last Friday. His earlier tests from RRT - the last being on April 21 - were all negative for Covid-19. The ministry has assessed that his case is likely a recent infection despite his positive serology test. The cleaner had received his first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine on Jan 29 and the second dose on Feb 19. The third employee at Changi Airport is a 33-year-old safety coordinator who works for Shimizu Corporation. He is deployed at Terminal 3 but does not interact with passengers. He was tested for Covid-19 as part of RRT last Tuesday. He developed a fever after work last Wednesday and sought medical treatment at a general practitioner clinic the next day, where he was tested for Covid-19. His test result came back positive last Friday, as did his RRT pooled test result, and he was conveyed to NCID. His serology test result has come back negative, MOH said. The fourth case is a part-time GrabFood deliveryman who also works in the maritime sector. The 40-year-old Singaporean also works for Batamindo Shipping & Warehousing as an operations assistant at Keppel Distripark. He is asymptomatic, and was detected when he was tested last Tuesday as part of RRT. His pooled test result came back positive for Covid-19 last Wednesday and he was taken to NCID the next day, where an individual test was done. His earlier tests from RRT - the last being on March 14 - were all negative for Covid-19 infection. His serology test result has come back positive, which suggests past infection, but the MOH has assessed that this is likely a recent infection. He had not been at Pasir Panjang Terminal and his case is unlinked, the ministry said. The fifth case is an 18-year-old Victoria Junior College student who was last in school last Wednesday. All the five cases are unlinked. The remaining two community cases are linked to the Pasir Panjang Terminal cluster, taking the case tally for the cluster to eight. They are family members and household contacts of three previous cases linked to the cluster. They were quarantined last Wednesday after being identified as close contacts of a trailer truck driver who works at Pasir Panjang Terminal and Brani Terminal. One of them is a car mechanic who visits Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) campsbut does not interact with SAF personnel, said MOH. Separately, the Ministry of Defence said on Saturday night that he last visited Clementi Camp last Tuesday. He had minimal contact with SAF personnel, none of whom has been identified as a close contact. Overall, the number of new cases in the community has risen from 37 in the week before to 43 in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has remained stable at 10 per week in the past two weeks. There were also 13 imported cases, taking Singapore's total number of Covid-19 cases to 61,331. With six cases discharged on Saturday, 60,897 patients have fully recovered from the disease. A total of 133 patients remain in hospital, including two in critical condition in intensive care. Another 255 patients are recuperating in community facilities. Singapore has had 31 deaths from Covid-19 complications, while 15 who tested positive have died of other causes.

The unlinked case was a fully vaccinated cleaner who works at Changi Airport Terminal 3, said the Ministry of Health (MOH). The 88-year-old Singaporean has not returned to work since he started having a runny nose and cough on Tuesday. The cleaner, who is employed by Ramky Cleantech Services, sought medical treatment at a general practitioner clinic, where he was tested for Covid-19. His test result came back positive on Wednesday, and he was taken to Sengkang General Hospital. His earlier tests from rostered routine testing - the last being on April 16 - were all negative for infection. The cleaner had received his first dose of Covid-19 vaccine on Jan 22 and the second dose on Feb 15. His serological test result is pending, said MOH. The second community case is a 22-year-old full time national serviceman with the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF), who is linked to the Pasir Panjang Terminal cluster. This takes the total number of cases linked to the cluster to five. The permanent resident is a household contact of a 59-year-old trailer truck driver who was reported to have Covid-19 on Wednesday. He was quarantined on Tuesday after the trailer truck driver tested positive, and was immediately isolated while in Sembawang Camp. On Wednesday, he was tested for the virus even though he is asymptomatic. His test result came back positive the next day, and he was taken to Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. His serology test result is negative, said MOH. Separately, the Ministry of Defence said on Thursday that the SAF has carried out immediate and thorough disinfection of the premises the serviceman had been in. \"All personnel who had been identified as close contacts have also been swab tested and are under quarantine.\" It is alsoin contact with the serviceman and his family to render support and assistance. Overall, the number of new cases have increased to 48 cases in the past week from 28 in the week before. The number of unlinked cases have remained stable at seven cases over the same period. There were also 16 new imported cases who had been placed on stay-home notice on arrival in Singapore, said MOH. This takes the total tally of cases in Singapore to 61,286. A coffee shop in Woodlands visited eight times between 7pm and 7.30pm was also added to the list of places visited by Covid-19 cases while they were infectious. Between April 22 and Monday, patients had visited Yummy Food Link at Block 111 Woodlands Street 13. Other places added were NTUC Fairprice at White Sands mall in Pasir Ris, Kopitiam at Changi Airport Terminal 3, Pasir Ris Market Produce Shop and hair salon Kcuts at Marsiling Mall. Those identified as close contacts of confirmed cases would already have been notified, MOH added. Individuals may access the SafeEntry Location Matching Self-Check service via the TraceTogether App, SingPass Mobile, or at this websiteto check whether they were at these locations during the specified timings, based on their own SafeEntry records. There is no need to avoid places where confirmed cases of Covid-19 were at, as the National Environment Agency will engage the management of affected premises to provide guidance on cleaning and disinfection, said MOH.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - Singapore is gearing up for a temporary disruption to its re-opening plans, as it raises its defences against the coronavirus following the worst spate of Covid-19 community infections in close to a year. Pre-schools will impose curbs on parents entering their premises, restaurants are scrambling to rearrange bookings made for Mother\\'s Day this weekend while more people will start working from home even before restrictions are tightened on Saturday (May 8). At firms such as UOB and power generation company Senoko Energy, workers who are able to do so are already telecommuting full-time. They had embarked on these arrangements earlier this week. This is above and beyond the demands of the new rules, which allow for up to 50 per cent of employees who are able to work from home to be in the office at any one time. Currently, the capacity limit is 75 per cent. There was some respite on Wednesday with just one new Covid-19 case in the community being reported, although the number had hit 62 over the past week - more than the total for the first quarter of the year. Still, there was no let-up in precautions. The Early Childhood Development Agency said that, from Saturday, there would be a ban on all parents entering pre-school premises, except those with newly-enrolled children. Meanwhile, gyms, sports associations, restaurants and arts groups are scrambling to make alternative arrangements for events, performances, classes and gatherings. This is in view of new measures that will require indoor gyms and fitness studios to close, as well as for social gatherings to be reduced to groups of up to five, down from eight currently. President Halimah Yacob acknowledged that the tightened measures may be disappointing to Singaporeans, especially to those who are looking forward to celebrating Hari Raya. \"But I hope Singaporeans understand the importance of reacting quickly to prevent the situation from worsening further,\" she wrote on Facebook, urging Singaporeans to stay united in the long-drawn fight against Covid-19. Large events - such as worship services, weddings, funerals and live performances - will also face more restrictions, including pre-event testing and reduced sizes from Saturday till May 30. On Wednesday, food and beverage operators were kept busy fielding calls, as scores of diners dialled in to make changes to Mother\\'s Day bookings this weekend. Some have requested to bring reservations forward to Friday, while others have reduced dining party sizes or asked to cancel bookings altogether. Restaurants are also bracing themselves for a surge in takeaway and delivery orders instead. Meanwhile, some domestic sports leagues have suspended their competitions till May 30. Indoor fitness studios are also exploring alternative arrangements, including offering classes online or offering more outdoor classes. Arts groups have also started making fresh arrangements, including by introducing additional show times for concerts so that audience capacities can be reduced. Seating plans may also be re-arranged so that audiences can sit in groups of up to five people, instead of eight. The Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth on Wednesday released new measures for religious activities. At worship services with more than 50 people, including those subject to pre-event testing requirements, attendees have to be segregated into zones of no more than 50 people each. Those involved in conducting of the worship service will not be allowed to sing while masked. Join ST\\'s Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - Sports activities will be confined to groups of no more than five from Saturday (May 8) to May 30, said national agency Sport Singapore (SportSG)in an advisory designed to curb the transmissionof Covid-19 within the community. Under its latest guidelines, which werereleased on Thursday (May 6), multiple groups of five will be allowed for organised programmes and classes, but with a cap of 30 people in total, excluding an additional service provider such as an instructor or a coach. This follows the multi-ministry task force\\'s (MTF) announcement on Tuesday that saw the introduction of a slew of measures to reduce the risk of community transmission, which included a cap of five people - down from eight previously - for social gatherings. Other restrictions for the sports sector include the closure of indoor gyms and indoor fitness facilities such as yoga or pilatesstudios as well as the suspension of mass participation events for the same duration. The new measures apply to all public and private gyms and fitness studios, even those operated by commercial enterprises, national sports associations, country clubs, golf clubs, private apartments, condominiums and charities. However, indoor sports facilities such as badminton halls, basketball courts and climbing gyms will continue to remain open because the SportSG directive applies only to \"enclosed, confined indoor spaces where participants are likely to be engaging in strenuous activities unmasked\". Spectators will also be barred from attending sports events. In its press release, SportSG added that it would consult industry representatives to provide \"appropriate support\" to those affected, providing additional help on top of what is already offered under the Sports Resilience Package. Details will be announced when ready. SportSG chief executive Lim Teck Yin said: \"We fully understand that these measures seem sudden and drastic, but we have to work quickly together to bring the current spread under control. SportSG will be looking to work with the industry to cushion the impact on affected entities.\" Apart from the mandatory closure of gyms and fitness studios during this period, all wading pools and play pools at ActiveSG facilities will also be closed. The SwimSafer programme, an initiative by SportSG and the Ministry of Education to teach swimming proficiency and water survival skills to children, will also be put on hold during the stipulated period. Refunds for bookings at ActiveSG facilities that fall under the specified dates will be processed within the next seven working days. The occupancy limit for sports facilities, including outdoor oneslike pools,will be reduced from one person per 8 sq m to one person per 10 sq m, with a maximum of 50 people allowed into the venue. While approved large outdoor classes in public spaces can continue, the total class size will be capped at 30 people, including participants, the registered instructor and any assistants. The National School Games, which started in March and was scheduled to end in May, will also be suspended for the same duration. Professional sports leagues and events such as the Singapore Premier League will be allowed to continue, although all matches will be played behind closed doors.

Singapore now has 10 active Covid-19 clusters. The latest case is a 59-year-old trailer truck driver who works at Brani Terminal and Pasir Panjang Terminal, said the Ministry of Health (MOH). The Singaporean employed by GKE Express Logistics was last at work on May 1. He developed a fever and sore throat on Sunday (May 2), and remained at home. The next day, he sought medical treatment at a general practitioner clinic and was tested for Covid-19. His result came back positive on Tuesday, and he was conveyed in an ambulance to Alexandra Hospital. His serology test result is pending, said MOH. The earliest case in the cluster is a 23-year-old Indian national who works as a lashing specialist at the Pasir Panjang Terminal and was confirmed to have Covid-19 on April 10. As a precautionary measure, MOH will carry out special testing operations to test port workers employed by PSA Singapore who have been deployed at the terminal. This comes as community infections surge in Singapore, with cases increasing to 62 in the past week from 13 in the week before. The number of unlinked cases hasalso risen to seven cases from six over the same period. There were also 15 imported cases who were placed on stay-home notice on arrival in Singapore, said MOH. In all, 16 coronavirus cases were reported on Wednesday, taking Singapore's total to 61,268. A POSB branch in Kaki Bukit Recreation Centre was added to the list of locations visited by Covid-19 cases linked to Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) while they were still infectious, MOH said. The branch was visited between 10.05am and 11.30am on April 27. People who have been to these places should get tested for the virus, which is free for them, the authorities said on April 30. Chinatown Complex Food Centre, Clementi 448 Market & Food Centre and ST 11 Coffee House were added to the list of locations visited by Covid-19 cases while they were still infectious, MOH said on Wednesday night. Those identified as close contacts of confirmed cases would already have been notified, MOH added. Individuals may access the SafeEntry Location Matching Self-Check service via the TraceTogether App, SingPass Mobile, or at this websiteto check whether they were at these locations during the specified timings, based on their own SafeEntry records. There is no need to avoid places where confirmed cases of Covid-19 have been as the National Environment Agency will engage the management of affected premises to provide guidance on cleaning and disinfection, said MOH. With 21 cases discharged on Wednesday, 60,829 patients have fully recovered from the disease. A total of 131 patients remain in hospital, including two in critical condition in the intensive care.

Two of the four children are linked to the Learning Point tuition centre cluster. Both of them, aged 8 and 12, are pupils of St Andrew's Junior School and took the same school bus as a pupil who attended enrichment classes at Learning Point and was later confirmed to have Covid-19. This brings the total number of patients in the Learning Point cluster to nine, after a 50-year-old woman who works as a tutor there was confirmed to have Covid-19 on Wednesday. The remaining two children are a 6-year-old boy who is a pupil at Palm View Primary School and a 7-year-old boy who is a pupil at Yio Chu Kang Primary School. Both cases are linked to the operating theatre nurse who worked at Sengkang General Hospital. Of the 19 cases in the community, 17 are linked to previous cases. They include a prison inmate who is a 32-year-old Singaporean man who was a close contact of the chef who works at Changi Prison Complex.

But in less than a week, the amount hit $43,000. This week, she will be able to send 50 oxygen cylinders to a hospital in Ahmedabad. The 34-year-old Singaporean, who works in a freight company, said reading about the tragedies in India cut close to home. \"My mother-in-law\\'s sister died last year from Covid-19 in Mumbai.\" Hers is just one of several ground-up initiatives in Singapore to gather supplies or collect funds for India, which has seen over two million new coronavirus cases in the past week alone. The Indus Entrepreneurs Singapore, a chapter of the largest global entrepreneur and investor foundation, launched Mission India last Thursday to raise US$1 million (S$1.33 million) by May 12 for medical supplies. It collected more than $75,000 in less than a day. Singaporean Elise Tan Yee Ling, 35, founder of Makan For Hope, an initiative that connects entrepreneurs and industry leaders to give back to society, hopes to play her part. Participants who wish to join the Makan For Hope sessions pay US$20, of which 85 per cent will go to charities. For the month of May, they will donate full proceeds to the Singapore Red Cross (SRC) Covid-19 India relief. SRC, which launched a public appeal last Wednesday, raised more than $500,000 in four days from its online and offline platforms and via Give.asia. Within the Catholic community, Caritas Humanitarian Aid and Relief Initiatives Singapore (Charis) hopes to raise $300,000 to provide monetary aid and supplies to India. It will work with its sister organisation, Caritas India, to set up seven treatment centres offering basic medical services. Charis will also be collaborating with SRC to procure and ship respiratory equipment into India. Yesterday, India\\'s Minister of External Affairs S.

       " {'text': 'global cooperation and stable world order essential to overcome pandemic dpm heng Read 3 articles daily and stand to win ST rewards, including the ST News Tablet worth $398. Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - The world is at another crossroads in the fight against Covid-19, and if it does not step up global cooperation, it may be caught in a vicious circle of never-ending waves of infection. Such cooperation is possible only if there is a stable global order, one which is increasingly under pressure due to growing strategic competition between theUnited States and China, said Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat on Thursday (May 20). Speaking at the virtual 26th International Conference on the Future of Asia, better known as the Nikkei conference after its organiser Nikkei Inc, Mr Heng said US-China competition is \"here to stay\" for the foreseeable future. \"For both the US and China, domestic considerations remain paramount. Neither can afford to appear weak nor be seen to be conceding ground to the other,\" he said. He noted that even as China marks the politically significant 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China this year, in the US, there is strong bipartisan consensus and public support for a tougher approach towards China. It is not unusual for major powers to have disagreements or to compete for influence, said Mr Heng. What is important, he said, is that competition be conducted within a stable framework so as to defuse tensions, and to avoid a situation where differing interests prevent both sides from cooperating even on common interests - or worse still, escalate into armed conflict. \"While I believe that competition may be inevitable, it need not be zero sum. It is possible for both sides to find a new mode of constructive competition,\" he said. \"The key is for both sides to work towards a modus vivendi, of building confidence and trust, and competing within a rules-based multilateral system where there are established rules and norms of engagement. Healthy competition can spur innovation to create better solutions to the world\\'s challenges.\" He noted some encouraging steps have been taken, such as the first high-level meeting between both sides in Alaska in March, and early signs of cooperation on climate change. In April, US and China climate change envoys John Kerry and Xie Zhenhua met in Shanghai to discuss tackling the climate crisis. Chinese President Xi Jinping also attended the Leaders\\' Summit on Climate hosted by US President Joe Biden. Mr Heng expressed hope that by building on areas of common interest, both the US and China can eventually arrive at a framework for stable competition. But he cautioned that US-China strategic competition could intensify. It will not be straightforward to achieve a new equilibrium, as both countries will continue to jostle for strategic influence, particularly in Asia. He added: \"I speak on behalf of many, if not most, countries in the region that we welcome and want to strengthen relations with both the US and China. We hope to engage both constructively. Within South-east Asia, we welcome their continued cooperation and support for Asean centrality and unity. \"But with the ongoing strategic competition, we will need to navigate greater uncertainty and possibly turbulence.\" To emerge stronger from the crisis, Asia can further strengthen the regional architecture and partnerships, such as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), Mr Heng said. Former president Donald Trump withdrew the US from the deal during his first week in office, leaving 11 other countries negotiating the TPP - including Singapore - to form the trade agreement. \"I know that the current political conditions make it difficult for the US to rejoin, but things are never static, and the US should not rule it out,\" Mr Heng said. While the idea of the Biden administration joining the CPTPP trade deal has been floated, significant barriers remain, including domestic considerations within the US. Another key pact is the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), whose next important step is to expedite ratification. A number of countries including Singapore have already done so, and the RCEP remains open to India when it is ready, he said. \"The CPTPP and RCEP are important building blocks for the region and for the world. The door remains open for other like-minded partners to join us. Both agreements also serve as pathfinders for a possible FTA of the Asia-Pacific, one which should include the US, China, and India. \"Such an FTA will shape economic relationships and the region\\'s geostrategic landscape for years to come.\" Mr Heng said Asia can continue to maintain constructive dialogue on difficult issues such as the Korean Peninsula, Taiwan Strait, South China Sea and Myanmar. Many of these are long-standing issues with entrenched positions by the stakeholders, said Mr Heng, and while there are no easy solutions to bridge the divergent interests, major conflict could have catastrophic consequences. \"So, the region must do what we can to reduce the risk of miscalculations, and prevent situations from boiling over.\" Countries must also invest in emerging opportunities across borders, so that they can raise living standards and share in one another\\'s growth, Mr Heng said. One area is the huge infrastructure needs in the region. He noted that the funding gap in developing Asia, estimated at US$1.7 trillion (S$2.3 trillion) per year before Covid-19, would have increased since then. No government would be able to fund these projects on its own, he said. Greater collaboration between countries, multilateral development banks and the private sector is needed to enhance collective capacity. Japan, where households are holding on to almost US$10 trillion in cash and deposits, can consider investing some of these monies to earn returns while improving lives, Mr Heng said. Countries can also collaborate on environmental sustainability, he said - not just in terms of natural capital, but also in ensuring high standards of quality and verifiability of carbon credits, and developing vibrant exchanges for these credits to be traded. Mr Heng expressed optimism that Asian countries can navigate this difficult period by strengthening partnerships, investing in one another, and taking a constructive approach to handling hot spots in the region. \"In this way, Asia and the world can emerge stronger together from Covid-19, and contribute to a better global order.\" Join ST\\'s Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - Over the four months or so since mass Covid-19 vaccination started here, 20 cases of a severe and potentially life-threatening allergic reaction known as anaphylaxis have been reported. They are among the 95 cases of serious adverse events associated with the Covid-19 vaccine, according to the first safety update of the mRNA Covid-19 vaccines used here, from the Health Sciences Authority (HSA). These serious effects are rare, with the cases comprising just 0.004 per cent of the more than 2.2 million doses administered from Dec 30 to April 18, said the HSA. In all, about 0.13 per cent of the doses administered resulted in suspected adverse reactions, with the data showing that younger people are more likely to suffer side effects. About 70 per cent of these cases involved people who were youngerthan 60 years old, although they made up about half of the people who have taken the vaccines. More than four in 1,000 persons between 20 and 39 reported adverse conditions such as rashes, hives, dizziness and fever, compared with the 1.2 in 1,000 persons aged between 60 and 69 years old who reported the same reactions, said HSA. According to the Ministry of Health (MOH), as at April 18, more than 1.36 million people here have received the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine and nearly 850,000 people have completed the vaccination regimen by taking both doses. The HSA defines an adverse effect as serious when it results in hospitalisation, extended stay in hospital, a significant reduction in functional capacity, or a life-threatening event like anaphylaxis, or death. No one here has died from taking the Covid-19 vaccine. There have also been no reports of unusual blood clots associated with low platelets that have been reported with other types of Covid-19 vaccines overseas, said the HSA. The HSA data covers mostly those who had taken the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine because this was available since Dec 30. The Moderna vaccine arrived here only in March. Anaphylaxis remains the greatest concern because it is potentially life threatening. The reaction typically happens very quickly. Within minutes of getting the vaccine, a person who has it may experience swelling of the face, eyes and lips. Their airway can be constricted and there may be nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Some people can take longer to experience this, which is why the authorities want everyone who is taking the vaccine to be observed for 30 minutes afterwards. Every vaccination centre will also have a team of medical professionals on duty. The onset of symptoms for 6 in 10 of theseanaphylaxis cases came within the 30-minute observation period after the vaccine was given. HSA said that 80 per cent of those who suffered from anaphylaxis were women, 55 per cent of whom had a history of allergies to drugs or food. All the people who developed anaphylaxis after taking thevaccinehave recovered after medical treatment, said the HSA. The incidence rate of this reaction here is about 1.4 per 100,000 doses administered, which is similar to the incidence rates reported overseas of around 0.5 to two per 100,000 doses administered. Anaphylaxis is a reaction that has been reported with the use of other vaccines, as is Bell's palsy, a condition where there is a temporary paralysis of a part of the facial muscle, which the HSA is also monitoring closely. There have been 25 cases here of Bell's palsy, which is caused by the inflammation of the facial nerve, and most are not serious. Most patients recover from it completely, even without treatment, the HSA said. The 25 cases workout to a rate of 3.45 per 100,000 people per month, which is within the expected incidences of 1.1 to 4.4 per 100,000 people per monthprior to the introduction of vaccination, said the HSA. In the group of 95 with suspected adverse events, another 20 had severe allergic reactions that included severe rashes, possible shortness of breath and rapid heartbeat. The rest experienced breathing difficulty, fast heart rate, an increase or decrease in blood pressure, chest discomfort, fainting, limb numbness or pain that lasted for a few days, changes in vision and increase in liver enzymes, said the HSA update. Most of the 95 cases were reported to have recovered or are recovering. They are among a bigger group of 2,796 cases of adverse effects associated with the vaccine, according to the HSA data. So far, the most commonly reported suspected side effects of getting a Covid-19 vaccine are rashes, hives, dizziness, swelling of eyelids, face orlips, fever, shortness of breath, muscle aches and pain, headache, and itchy skin, said the HSA. <!--//--><![CDATA[// ><!--iFrameResize()//--><!]]> It said heart attacks and strokes can occur naturally in people, regardless of whether they are vaccinated or not. The HSA, which will continue to monitor the safety of the vaccines, will be releasing vaccine safety updates on a monthly basis from now on. This report comes amid a surge in the number of community infections here, with locally transmitted cases rising to 62 in the past week, from 13 in the week before. Most of them are linked to the Tan Tock Seng Hospital cluster. Most people in the cluster who had been fully vaccinated showed mild or no symptoms.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - A student who is a resident on the Yale-NUS Campus was among nine community cases confirmed on Friday (April 30) by the Ministry of Health (MOH). With the nine, MOH has announced 35 new community cases in the past week. The student, a 20 year-old male Indian national, last attended classes on April 12. He had been in India from March 21 last year to Jan 20 this year, and was a close contact of two confirmed Covid-19 cases while there. He developed a fever, sore throat and body aches on Monday and isolated himself in his room. He was tested for Covid-19 at the National University of Singapore's University Health Centre on Wednesday and his result came back positive on Thursday. MOH said his CT (cycle threshold)was very high, which is indicative of a low viral load, and his serology test result has come back positive. This suggests he could be shedding minute fragments of the virus RNA from a past infection which is no longer transmissible and infective to others, said MOH. However, MOH said that as it is not able to definitively conclude when he had been infected, all necessary public health actions will be taken as a precautionary measure. The eight other patients in the community are linked to previous cases. Two of the cases, a 33-year-old female Indian national and her four-year-old daughter, are linked to an earlier case - a 34-year-old male Indian national who is a senior research fellow at NUS and was confirmed positive on April 15. Another two are linked to a 39-year-old Vietnamese woman who works as a cleaner at a community care facility in Tuas South and was confirmed positive on Wednesday. One of them, a 41-year-old Malaysian man, works as a sales assistant at New Odense(s) Confectionery & Bakery in Woodlands, and is the Vietnamese woman's household contact, while the other, a 26-year-old female permanent resident, is both a household contact and a colleague of the woman. The last four community cases are linked to the Tan Tock Seng Hospital cluster, which now comprises 13 cases. One is a 41-year-old female Chinese national who works as a cleaner, and was deployed to the hospital's Ward 9D, where the cluster began. Another case, a 77-year-old Singaporean woman, was admitted to Ward 9D on April 22. After being discharged to United Medicare Centre (Toa Payoh) Nursing Home on Tuesday, she was tested on Wednesday. Her test returned positive on the same day. The hospital has stopped all patient transfers to intermediate and long-term care facilities until swabs for patients and staff in lockdown wards are done and cleared. It has alsoreminded facilities to be vigilant and closely monitor patients transferred from the hospital from April 18 onwards. This includes segregating and isolating transfer patients from the rest of the residents, said MOH. The third new patient in the hospital cluster is a 65-year-old Singaporean woman who is a patient in Ward 9C, while the last patient is a 36-year-old Singaporean male doctor at the National Neuroscience Institute, located within the hospital. Meanwhile, 15 new imported cases were announced on Friday, while there were no new cases from within workers' dormitories. The number of new cases in the community increased from 10 two weeks ago to 35 in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community in a week also increased from five cases to six over the same period. With 13 cases discharged on Friday, 60,736 patients have fully recovered from the disease. A total of 113 patients remain in hospital, with none in intensive care, while 251 are recuperating in community facilities. Singapore has had 30 deaths from Covid-19 complications, while 15 who tested positive have died of other causes. <!--//--><![CDATA[// ><!--iFrameResize()//--><!]]> <!--//--><![CDATA[// ><!--iFrameResize()//--><!]]> <!--//--><![CDATA[// ><!--iFrameResize()//--><!]]> Join ST's Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE (THE BUSINESS TIMES) - Heritage business Swee Kee Eating House will be shuttering its outlet on May 30, 2021, it said in a Facebook post. Located along Amoy Street for over 26 years, the Cantonese-style fish soup shop has a history of more than 80 years. \"We had weathered the World War, economic depression and Sars; however, the challenges of Covid-19 and a CBD (Central Business District) location have proved too much and too challenging for us to sustain with continued monthly losses in this current climate,\" wrote Cedric Tang, third-generation owner of the business. The group will now consolidate its resources to focus on its Ka-Soh brand, which has two outlets in Outram and Greenwood. \"Swee Kee Eating House has always been more than a business or restaurant, it was also my home which I grew up in with since the days at Chin Chew Street,\" he wrote. \"We are extremely honoured to be part of Singapore\\'s history and one of Singapore\\'s oldest independent/family-owned restaurants.\" Mr Tang told The Business Times that the \"writing has been on the wall\" since recovery from the pandemic has been slow, with the food and beverage (F&B) businesses in the central business district \"greatly affected\". \"I believe even those who saw a slight recovery have all their gains wiped out just by this week alone,\" he said. Singapore instituted a one-month ban on dining in since May 16, triggered by a rise in Covid-19 community cases. Working from home is now the default, which means that F&B operators in the CBD are likely to struggle. Mr Tang noted that while many of Swee Kee\\'s regulars - mostly from the older generation who have patronised the outlet for decades - have returned following Singapore\\'s circuit breaker measures last year, this was not enough to keep the business going. This is despite offering delivery options through the Oddle platform. \"It\\'s definitely very hard to have to decide to close Amoy, but it makes the most sense as we\\'re also facing manpower issues across our outlets, which is why we will be redeploying most of my staff to the remaining outlets,\" he said. But die-hard fans need not be too dismayed. Mr Tang added that following the closure, he will try to bring Swee Kee\\'s signature flavours to its Ka-Soh restaurants. The month-long ban on dining-in is expected to be a setback to F&B operators, especially for those that had recently opened or expanded with new outlets. It is also a blow to illiterate, elderly hawkers as they are unable to tap into delivery platforms. To prop up the industry, the government will raise its wage support for F&B establishments to 50 per cent, up from 10 per cent, under the Jobs Support Scheme.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE (THE BUSINESS TIMES) - Analysts anticipate profit-taking on the Singapore bourse as Singapore reinstates pre-emptive Covid-19 safety measures from May 8 to 30. This comes amid a rise in Covid-19 community cases here, including a cluster at Tan Tock Seng Hospital detected in the past week. The sell-off has already started, with Singapore shares swimming in a sea of red during the early morning trading session on Wednesday (May 5). At the midday trading break, all index counters except Jardine Matheson Holdings were down. The Straits Times Index (STI) eventually closed 0.8 per cent down at3,153.59 on Wednesday. When the market opened on Wednesday, decliners outnumbered gainers 98 to 30, or three down for every one up, a ratio not seen in the past five days of trading - which has been largely even, according to a tally by The Business Times. So far, the STIhas hit a one-month low, reaching 3,145.20 as at 9.04am on Wednesday. The last time the STI closed near this level was on March 25 at 3,141.71. For CGS-CIMB, year-to-date performers such as banks and travel-related stocks like Singapore Airlines and Sats will likely see a hit on share performance in the short term. Reduced activities will likely hit transport stocks such as ComfortDelGro and SBS Transit, as well as retail real estate investment trusts (Reits) and other reopening beneficiaries like Genting Singapore and Jumbo. Office Reits are less likely to be affected due to existing hybrid work-from-home and office structures. Meanwhile, sentiment among developers and realtors could be slightly affected if transaction volumes take a breather from more virtual versus physical viewings, CGS-CIMB said. Uncertainty over a potential circuit breakercould also see renewed interest in pandemic beneficiaries. These include supermarket plays such as Sheng Siong and Dairy Farm, as well as glove-sector stocks such as UG Healthcare and Riverstone. A heightened pace of testing will also benefit healthcare proxies such as Q&M Dental and Raffles Medical, CGS-CIMB said. Echoing the sentiment, Maybank Kim Eng said Q&M Dental will likely benefit because of its exposure to the Covid-19 tests business. The research team initiated coverage on the stock in March with \"buy\" and a target price of 87 cents. Maybank KE also expects Q&MDental to \"close the valuation gap\" against bigger listed peers because ofa more superior earnings trajectory at CGS-CIMB\\'s estimates of 58 per cent, 20 per cent and 13 per cent for the financial years of 2021, 2022 and 2023 respectively.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - Seven primary schools will move to home-based learning (HBL) for the next two weeks, until the end of term two on May 28, it was announced on Saturday (May 15), after a small number of pupils in those schools tested positive for Covid-19. The cases are linked to tuition centres, and none of the pupils seems to have caught the virus while in school thus far. The Ministry of Education (MOE) said the move is a precautionary measure. The schools are: 1. Kong Hwa School 2. Palm View Primary School 3. St Andrew's Junior School 4. St Margaret's Primary School 5. St Stephen's School 6. Yio Chu Kang Primary School 7. Yu Neng Primary School In the case of Yio Chu Kang Primary, pupils there are already on HBL, and this will be extended till May 28. The MOE said that it is in contact with the schools to provide the necessary support, and is closely monitoring the well-being of pupils and staff identified as close contacts of confirmed cases. In a Facebook post, Education Minister Chan Chun Sing said he shared the same concerns as parents over the recent cases related to schoolchildren. “Our immediate priority is to ring-fence the schools with confirmed cases to safeguard the well-being of our students and staff.” The minister added that from Monday, schools will implement heightened safe management measures. Classes will be strictly in cohorts, all co-curricular activities (CCAs) will be conducted online, and fixed seating with safe distancing for recess will be enforced, with no intermingling. He also said private tuition and enrichment centres should move lessons online during this period, and inspections will be stepped up to ensure the safety of pupils. “As we do our best to keep our students’ learning environment safe, MOE and the Ministry of Health are also working out the plans for vaccination of our students. Once the approval for use is granted, we will roll out vaccinations to those below 16,” he added. Several pupils have been testing positive for the coronavirus in recent days, with many linked to the cluster at Learning Point tuition centre in Parkway. Five of them – two from Kong Hwa, one from St Andrew’s Junior and two from St Stephen’s – had tested positive on May 13 after attending classes run by an infected private tutor at the centre. Two pupils from St Andrew’s, who took the same school bus as one of the five, tested positive on Saturday. Another four pupils from the same centre – two from Kong Hwa, one from St Margaret’s Primary and one from Yu Neng Primary – also tested positive on Saturday. Another group of three pupils linked to the EduFirst Learning Centre in Hougang – two from Yio Chu Kang Primary and one from Palm View Primary – tested positive in recent days. A Yio Chu Kang Primary pupil who attended the centre had tested positive on May 13, and other pupils from the centre were quarantined and tested. Two of them later tested positive.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - The nation\\'s Covid-19 situation could be more dangerous than it was just before thecircuit breaker last year, and people must go above and beyond what is being asked for to keep safe, said the National Centre for Infectious Diseases\\' (NCID) Associate Professor David Lye. In a message thatwas circulating on WhatsApp and other social media platforms on Monday (May 17), the director of NCID\\'s Infectious Disease Research and Training Office called on those here to \"do much more beyond what government dictates\". The Straits Timesverified the text with NCID, whichconfirmed that Prof Lyehad written it. Apart from exhorting people to stay home, avoid crowded places and big groups, he also called for people to form their own \"small social bubble\" consisting of those who are committed to socialising only within the bubble. \"For manythis is your immediate family,\" said Prof Lye, who is also a senior consultant at Tan Tock Seng Hospital\\'s (TTSH) Department of Infectious Diseases. He added that people should ensure they wear a mask over their mouth and nose even when walking in parks, and that more should get vaccinated as the recent outbreak at TTSHshowed that not enough vulnerable old people have done so. Prof Lye noted that the situation in Singapore last year was bad because of the huge outbreak in dormitories among migrant workers. This was contained with lockdowns - although this took a lot of resources. However, this year, the many cases with no linkage suggest that the spread to the community from the outbreak at Changi Airport may be \"wide and far\", he said. He added that 40 per cent to 50 per cent of those infected have no symptoms and can be equally infectious, while another 10 per cent can get sick enough to require oxygen. \"Yes we have effective vaccines and treatment, and expanded testing capacity,\" he pointed out, but working against these efforts are the new variants which originated from India, which infected TTSH and Changi Airport staff despite masks and vaccinations. \"This is serious.\" He concluded: \"If you want to keep your family safe, you need to listen and do the above. \"If a country is overwhelmed like India, many will die including children and young people, and sick people cannot get a bed and dead bodies can\\'t get cremated or buried. \"My colleague(s) and I don\\'t want to see you in NCID or any of the hospitals.\" Join ST\\'s Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.

SINGAPORE - Mr Jerrold Tan and Ms Stephanie Chan decided not to hold off on their wedding celebrations any more, despite a 10 per cent guest dropout rate and higher costs following the roll-out of stricter Covid-19 regulations. The veterinarians, both 29, tied the knot at Mandarin Oriental, Singapore on Saturday (May 8). They had postponed their wedding celebrations twice owing to the pandemic. \"As long as it was safe for us... (we decided) we would go ahead... with the 100-person wedding that we had planned for,\" said Mr Tan. New regulations were announced on Tuesday, in response to a recent spike in community cases. The rules, which kicked in yesterday, include mandatory pre-event testing (PET) for all unvaccinated attendees of wedding receptions involving more than 50 people. For wedding solemnisations where more than 50 people are attending, PET is also required for an unvaccinated wedding couple. Mr Tan and Ms Chan were unfazed by the PET requirements and having to spend more - as each test cost between $60 to $80 per guest - saying it was better than postponing their wedding again. The couple also shared a video of the PET - prepared by the hotel - with their guests, to assuage any fears about the process. Even so, about 10 per cent of their original guests decided not to attend. Ms Chan said some of them were still wary about getting tested, and the increase in community cases. The couple filled the vacancies with people from a longer guest list they had drawn up earlier. Mr Tan said the new five-person limit per table, down from eight previously, was more significant for them. They had to rearrange seating for their guests. Another couple - Mr Shiv Yadav, and Ms Jasvin Kaur, both 32 - also held their wedding on Saturday. They had postponed the traditional Hindu ceremony, which was to have taken place during the circuit breaker last year. Mr Yadav, an operations manager, said he incurred about $10,000 in costs after postponing the wedding. \"I said: \\'This time around...

       " {'text': \"sph sembcorp marine keppel capitaland singtel comfort profit 14856208 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners The corporate restructurings at Sembcorp Industries, Keppel Corp, CapitaLand, and SPH may only be the beginning as the healthy financial positions of Singapore’s conglomerates indicate many more are in the position to transform, says David Kuo. SINGAPORE: It seems that Sembcorp Industries could have hit upon something last year when it announced the sale of Sembcorp Marine to effectively create two entirely separate entities that will focus on energy and marine. That move may have triggered other Singapore conglomerates to think critically about their own businesses as Keppel Corporation (Keppel Corp), CapitaLand and Singapore Press Holdings (SPH) all announced large restructuring moves. It may well be that the writing has been on the wall for these four companies for a while now as far as restructuring goes. But where there may have been some latent hesitation to carve out traditional core business units, COVID-19 has thrown any emotional considerations out of the window and applied a lubricant of urgency to facilitate such splits. RETURN ON EQUITY There is a common factor with the four listed corporations, namely, their returns on equity (RoE) to shareholders have either been on the decline or noticeably weak. According to the DuPont model, there are three ways to boost a low RoE, which is often used by investors to gauge a company’s productivity. The three ways are to increase the profit margin, to increase the amount of borrowings, and to reduce the amount of assets used in the business. COVID-19 has reminded many businesses that they cannot always assume that profits can be increased simply by increasing sales or raising prices, especially if they don’t have adequate pricing power. Borrowing could be risky if inflationary pressures result in higher rates of interest later on. So, that leaves reducing assets as a final option. It can be unpalatable but arguably a necessary choice if a company wants to recapture its glory days of high returns on equity. THAT SHIP HAS SAILED In the case of Sembcorp Industries and Keppel Corp, the conditions for restructuring were already present - driven by changing consumer attitudes towards fossil fuel, the fluctuations in oil price and the rise of Chinese rig-builders which could offer more preferential credit terms due to the large amounts of liquidity they had access to from Chinese state lenders. However, COVID-19 accelerated this need for restructuring, as the pandemic adversely impacted the shipbuilding businesses of both groups. It not only reduced the demand for oil and gas exploration but also disrupted the supply of migrant workers who were crucial to their yard operations. It looks like the email address you entered is not valid. Keppel CEO Loh Chin Hua confirmed last year that its offshore and marine unit faced major challenges “from the COVID-19 pandemic and measures to contain its spread”. To remain competitive, Keppel had to look for new markets. That is why in January, it said that its Keppel Offshore and Marine (O&M) unit would exit the rig-building business. The exit would allow the unit to become leaner and better able to focus on other areas such as clean energy, renewables, and gas solutions – all of which are less labour-intensive businesses compared to offshore and marine. Keppel Corp added that it was exploring inorganic options for the O&M business, which is a euphemism for a merger, acquisitionor disposal. Keppel Corp, meanwhile, would focus on property development, telecommunicationsand asset management. As for Sembcorp, already in May 2020, it had reported the negative impact of the pandemic on its traditionally profitable energy and urban business units, in addition to the loss-making marine segment. In a media release then, the group acknowledged that “the impact of COVID-19 and the reduction in economic activity as a result of lockdowns in multiple markets has since led to a decrease in energy demand and prices” and, consequently, “the underlying performance of the Energy business in 2020 is expected to be markedly lower than 2019”. No wonder then, a month later, it announced selling off its marine business, which, in March, reported three consecutive years of losses. Shorn of its loss-making marine investment Sembcorp Industries should not only be more profitable, but it could be better positioned to capitalise on growing demand for energy generation and urban development. That was the rationale behind the split. Its shares might even be more appealing to investors, which could in turn raise its valuation. In fact, its valuation has already increased from an average of around 6.5 times earnings over the past decade to 7.7 times earnings more recently. Investors, it would appear, are prepared to now pay more for every dollar of profit that Sembcorp Industry makes. COVID HITS PROPERTY HARD For CapitaLand, it was a realisation that investors favour asset-light real estate businesses with more predictable earnings over developers that are prone to the ups and downs of the property cycle. This realisation was heightened during the pandemic as the group took a big hit to its residential, retail and lodging business segments. Due to lockdowns in Singapore, China and other markets, the group’s “residential sales offices were forced to close, non-essential retail trades were unable to operate, and the occupancy of its lodging assets fell due to travel restrictions”, it reported last year, as its first half net profit for 2020 fell by 89 per cent or nearly S$780 million. The losses from its property management business impacted its core property development work too. That is why in March the property conglomerate CapitaLand put forward a proposal to go asset-light by privatising its real estate business. It will also spin off its investment management arm into a separately-listed company. CLA Real Estate, which will own CapitaLand, will focus on property development, while stock-market listed CapitaLand Investment Management (CLIM) will adopt an asset-light model that should be able to earn more dependable, recurring income from its property investments. Similarly, SPH had to see its property business – retail malls and student accommodation – take a big hit last year due to COVID-19. For the financial year ended August 2020, the group suffered non-cash fair value losses of S$232 million as the valuation of its retail malls fell by S$196.5 million and that of its student accommodation assets by S$31.9 million. Fortunately, for SPH, these losses were mitigated by income from government schemes, including the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS), to sustain the company. Media has been the lifeblood of SPH. But its media division has, nevertheless, been a noticeable drag on the group’s performance for nearly a decade. In 2011, the division reported a healthy income of S$388 million on revenue of S$1.25 billion. Five years later, profit had shrunk by half to S$175 million on sales that had fallen to S$834 million. In 2020, COVID-19 also saw a 31.4 per cent declining in advertising revenue causing SPH Media to report a loss of S$11.4 million, while revenue had dropped further to S$445 million. This was despite SPH already laying off 140 staff last year from its media division. As the pandemic weakened companies’ financial positions and digital marketing became more ubiquitous, SPH’s advertising revenue was likely to be worse hit going forward. The company had already been depending on its rising property business to bankroll its declining media division. Even if SPH investors were to accept the continued financing of a loss-making media unit, the question is if the less valuable property business could afford to do so. With retail and demand for student accommodation affected by the pandemic, and with the JSS and other schemes running out, SPH’s property business would only suffer worse losses. Clearly, this equation was no longer viable. No wonder on May 6, SPH said it will hive off its media arm into a not-for-profit entity that will operate as a company limited by guarantee. The remaining listed business will focus on property, student accommodation and nursing homes. WHO’S NEXT? These companies may not be the last local listed groups we hear of restructuring. Certainly, Singtel has already announced a strategic review of two US-based businesses – including a digital marketing agency which has been badly impacted by COVID-19. Another sector that looks ripe for restructuring is the taxi business. It has already been disrupted by the entry of ride-hailing platforms that are, by comparison, asset-light and operate with more flexibility. But COVID-19 has seen the transport industry badly hit as lockdowns lead to lower passenger volumes. Over the last decade, cab company ComfortDelGro has reported around S$75 of revenue on every S$100 of asset employed in the business. While the company has still delivered a high return on shareholder equity, this has largely been through a high profit margin, rather than an efficient use of assets. An argument can be made for reducing its total assets, and cutting its margins, but still deliver an acceptable return on equity for shareholders. How have taxi drivers coped since COVID-19 hit our shores? Two gentlemen give their honest take on how it's been going in CNA's Heart of the Matter.

       " {'text': 'guarding against pandemic fatigue in singapore covid 19 fight 14827308 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: As Singapore experiences a rise in COVID-19 community cases, pandemic fatigue couldbe a concern as the country once again tightens its COVID-19 measures to address the spike in infections. On Sunday (May 16), Singapore confirmed 38 COVID-19 infections in the community-the highest number of community cases in more than a year - with 15 active COVID-19 clusters. Last week the Ministry of Health announced that Singapore would go into what it dubbed as \"Phase 2 (Heightened Alert)\" from May 16 through Jun 13, withgatherings restricted to groups of twoand working from home becoming the default for workers here. All primary andsecondary schools, as well as junior colleges and Millennia Institutealso shifted tofull home-based learning from May 19,after several primary school students tested positive for COVID-19. As the situation in Singapore becomes more challenging almost a year after the country exited from its “circuit breaker” period, how might pandemic fatigue be a factor instemming the spread of the coronavirus, and what can be done to overcome it? WHAT IS PANDEMIC FATIGUE? Pandemic fatigue is “a feeling of exhaustion from the changes that the pandemic has brought about, as well as feeling a sense of dread and irritation with the constant news of the pandemic”, as described by Dr Geraldine Tan, director and principal psychologist at private clinic The Therapy Room. People here were already feeling fatigued at the start of 2021 - about a year sincethe COVID-19 pandemic hit Singapore- she said, adding that theintroduction of further restrictions amid an increase in community cases would only make the exhaustion “more sore and painful”. Associate Professor Tan Ern Ser, a sociologist with the National University of Singapore, noted that people may have been feeling optimistic, thanks to the “vastly improving” situation in recent months, only to experience a sudden disappointment as Phase 2 restrictions were reintroduced. This could lead to anxiety resulting from uncertainty about the future, as well as inconveniences brought about byCOVID-19 precautionary measures, he said. “It is a real concern as it can affect our mental health, especially for those in danger ofgetting a pay-cut or worse, losing their job,” said Assoc Professor Tan. “I am having some fatigue as well,” infectious diseases expert Dr Leong Hoe Nam told CNA. People, especially healthcare workers, are “very tired”, especially with all the bad news and the real risks they face, said Dr Leong. The inability to travel, even to nearby destinations, could also be worsening the fatigue, said Professor Teo Yik Ying, dean of the National University of Singapore\\'s Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health. Singapore\\'s non-resident population may feel the brunt of the travel restrictions as they are unable to return to their home countries to visit their family and friends, noted Prof Teo. \"For this group of people, I expect the pandemic fatigue will be felt most acutely,\" he added. “I have definitely seen more and more (cases of fatigue) this year and they are not even aware that they are feeling fatigued from it,” said psychologist Dr Tan. Among the signs of pandemic fatigue are irritability, insomnia and lethargy, she said. She addedthat those suffering from such fatigue may also experience feeling cynical about life and wanting to escape from their family members, as well as a sense of dread towards work. A survey by Microsoft last year found that almost a third of workers in the Asia Pacific region citing increased rates of burnout since the start of the pandemic, stating that the lack of separation between work and personal obligations had negatively impacted their well-being. The tech giant’s annual Work Trend Index - which surveyed more than 6,000 workers across eight countries - found Singapore to be the country with the highest number of workers facing increased burnout, with 29 per cent of respondents experiencing such stress. WHAT CAN HELP? As the current crisis continues, pandemic fatigue could drag on for another six months to a year “at the very least”, said Dr Leong. “I think we need time out - and more space,” he said. While Dr Leongacknowledged there were no easy answers, he suggested that activities such as exercising, going out for a run, or even baking for some could help ease the sense of fatigue. Dr Tan suggested thatthose experiencing pandemic fatigue adopt healthier habits with work, by setting clear boundariesbetween work and family. Despite restrictions on social gatherings, people should still connect with friends, she said, adding that they should also stay physically active and continue doing the things they enjoy. Employers should meanwhile check in regularly with their staff members and provide opportunities for social interactions within safe limits, given the current work-from-home arrangements, said Dr Tan. They should also try to be there for employees who may not be able to articulate their difficulties with the current arrangements, she added. SAFE MANAGEMENT MEASURES A report by the World Health Organization (WHO) in Europe noted that such fatigue leads to “demotivation to follow recommended protective behaviours, emerging gradually over time and affected by a number of emotions, experiences and perceptions”. Still, despite mask wearing and safe distancing having been the norm in Singapore for more than a year now, observers do not expect that people here will abandon these or other COVID-19safe management measures. Prof Teoof the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Healthsaid people here have been “exceptionally compliant and tolerant” and appeared to have “accepted (that) these measures are here to stay for a while”. “There will always be a small segment of the population that will be less compliant, but by and large, Singapore and Singaporeans have actually done well with respect to complying with the restrictions put in,” he said. Sociologist Assoc Prof Tan said people understand the need to comply with such regulations - not so much because they are mandatory - but because they matter for the health, life and livelihood of the population. Prof Teo said that despite any fatigue, what can be done to ensure adherence to safe management measures is to continue with “repeated clear and consistent communications” to the public about the importance of keeping to these practices. The authorities should also maintain enforcement of safe management measures in public spaces and “continue to develop and maintain the trust between Government, employers (and) people, that all possible efforts are in place to ensure that Singapore stays focused on maintaining public health and the economy”, he said. Still, DrLeong is confident the country will survive thecurrent crisis. \"One thing is for sure, Singapore will come out stronger as certain as the sun will rise tomorrow,\" he said.

       " {'text': 'actor terence cao fined over 13 person birthday party held 14877878 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: Mediacorp actor and food business owner Terence Cao was finedS$3,500on Tuesday (May 25) over a 13-person birthday party held at his condominium unit during the COVID-19 pandemic, when social gatherings were limited. Cao, whose real name is Terence Choa Kwok Fai, pleaded guilty to one charge of permitting 12 guests who were not members of his household to enter his home for a non-permitted purpose. The court heard that Cao, 53, had planned a social gathering inhis home at Daisy Road on Oct 2, 2020 to celebrate his birthday, as well as the birthdays of fellow actors Shane Pow and Jeffrey Xu, when the number of guests was capped at five. He had invited five guests initially: Pow, Xu, co-accused Lance Lim, as well as artistes Benjamin Heng and Jeremy Chan. However, Lim invited more people including DJ Sonia Chew, actress Julie Tan Shaoyin and two marketing managers. One of the marketing managers in turn invited actress Dawn Yeoh. Pow, who is also facing a separate drink-driving charge, invited part-time model and actress Valnice Yek without knowing more guests were expected. Several other friends of Cao\\'s turned up uninvited at his home to surprise him, including sales manager Tan Jun Chuan and marketing manager Debbie Lu Shuyi. Throughout the gathering, the guests chatted, ate and drank without masks on, knowing that it was against the law to gather in a group of more than five people when Singapore was in Phase 2 of its reopening. At 11.30pm on Oct 2, 2020, all those present held a birthday cake-cutting ceremony and took group photos. Xu posted one of these pictures on his Instagram Stories page, before the guests began leaving, with the last guests leaving by 4am. The prosecutor asked for a fine of S$3,500, flagging Cao\\'s role as the host of the celebration and the need to send a deterrent message to homeowners to take care not to allow guests in beyond the legal limit. Cao\\'s lawyer S S Dhillon asked for a fine of S$2,000, saying Cao is sincerely remorseful for committing the offence and wishes he had been more prudent on hindsight and confined his celebrations to the allowed number of guests. A BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION TRANSFORMED INTO NIGHTMARISH PROPORTIONS: DEFENCE \"His birthday celebration was supposed to be a joyous occasion, but it transformed into nightmarish proportions,\" said Mr Dhillon in his mitigation plea. \"Indeed, the accused did not anticipate that his birthday celebration would attract negative publicity which has caused him emotional agony and anguish.\" He said Cao had not planned a social gathering for that many people, and that the gathering was mainly for Mediacorp artistes who were good friends and wanted to surprise each other \"out of goodwill\". Mr Dhillon said his client was caught between being \"legally wrong and morally incorrect\", adding that it would be morally or ethically \"wrong\" for Caonot to let his friends in for his birthday. \"His heart couldn\\'t turn them away,\" he said. At this, the prosecutor said it cannot be correct to imply that the COVID-19 regulations are somehow immoral or unethical in any way. \"The choice presented before the accused when the guests came is to decide, do I let them in? Or do I turn them away,\" said Deputy Public Prosecutor Norman Yew. \"There are laws to abide by, laws to save lives. That\\'s the choice he has to make. Unfortunately he chose to break the COVID-19 laws, not by accident ... At any moment, he could\\'ve told his guests \\'oh no, please leave\\'. That didn\\'t happen.\" LAWYER HIGHLIGHTS HIS CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS The defence lawyer added thatCao produced seven episodes of a mini-series called \"Frontline Heroes\" in September 2020 to highlight the struggles and bravery of the frontline essential workers during the pandemic, as a tribute to them. He also highlighted Cao\\'s charitable contributions over the years, including more than 10 years\\' participation in President\\'s Star charities. Mr Dhillon said Cao has a contract with Mediacorp but does not receive a salary from the company, instead starting his own business Sibay Shiok in August 2020 to support himself and his 12-year-old daughter. He said this was a one-off incident out of line with his character and that Cao will never allow this to happen again, after seeing the pain caused to his family. The arrest, police investigations and court attendances have \"completely shell-shocked\" Cao, said his lawyer, and he will \"never dare to be anything less than a law-abiding citizen henceforth\". The judge agreed that Cao had higher culpability than Lim and reminded all homeowners of the law. Cao could have been jailed up to six months, fined up to S$10,000or both for breaking a COVID-19 regulation. Lim was fined S$3,000 last week, while the other 11 guests were each given fines of S$300 with authorities explaining that they had taken their individual level of culpability into account in issuing them fines. An advisory was also issued to the management of Cao\\'s condominium to remind them to ensure compliance with safe management measures. It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

       " {'text': 'hdb bto flat sale exercise may launch covid 19 delay 14880694 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: The Housing Development Board (HDB) on Tuesday (May 25) launched 3,879 build-to-order (BTO) flats across four projects in Bukit Merah, Geylang, Tengah and Woodlands. It also said thatongoing BTO projects could be further delayed due to tightened COVID-19 border measures affecting the construction sector. In a press release, HDB said the flats under the May launch - the second sales exercise this year - comprise Telok Blangah Beacon and MacPherson Weave in the mature towns as well as Garden Bloom @ Tengah and Woodgrove Ascent in the non-mature towns. Units on offer range from two-room flexi to five-room flats, meeting \"the diverse housing needs of first-timers, second-timer families, seniors and singles\", said HDB. Prices start from S$98,000 for a two-room flexi flat at Woodgrove Ascent to S$710,000 for a four-room flat at Telok Blangah Beacon. \"Due to site conditions and the requirement for building contractors to adhere to strict safe management measures to prevent a resurgence of COVID-19 at construction sites, some projects may take longer than usual to complete,\" said HDB. \"Those who are in urgent need of housing may consider buying a resale flat instead where first-time buyers may enjoy up to S$160,000 in housing grants.\" HDB will also offer 2,494units in various towns and estatesunder the sale-of-balance-flat exercise. POSSIBLE FURTHER DELAY TO ONGOING PROJECTS \"Following the tighter border measures affecting the construction sector, we expect the completion of some BTO projects to be further delayed,\" said HDB. It said the six- to nine-month delay previously communicated could be extended by another three months or more, \"depending on how prolonged the situation is, and barring other unforeseen circumstances\". \"The extent of the delay varies with each BTO project, and depends on site-specific factors such as manpower availability, the contractor’s performance and materials supply,\" it added. \"HDB is also working with various agencies on mitigating measures to reduce the length of delays. This includes getting exemptions to allow less noisy construction activities to be carried out on Sundays and public holidays where possible,\" said the agency. The tightened border measures include longer stay-home notice periods for all travellers from higher-risk places, and a ban on short-term visitors and long-term pass holders with recent travel history fromIndia, Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Commenting on the delays amid the \"evolving COVID-19 situation\", Minister for National Development Desmond Lee said \"it is important that building contractors continue to adhere to strict safe management measures to prevent a resurgence of COVID-19 transmission at construction sites and dormitories\". \"For those who are currently waiting for your BTO flats, I would like to reassure you that HDB is working hard to keep BTO projects on track, and will keep you informed on the construction progress,\" Mr Lee said in a Facebook post on Tuesday. \"For those unable to find alternative housing arrangements in the interim with family members, relatives or on the open market, please reach out to HDB for assistance,\" he added. UPCOMING BTO LAUNCHES About 4,900 BTO flats will be offered in August in Hougang, Jurong East, Kallang Whampoa, Queenstown and Tampines, said HDB. Another 3,100 to 3,600 BTO flats will be launched in November in Choa Chu Kang, Hougang, Jurong West, Kallang Whampoa and Tengah. \"As the COVID-19 pandemic is evolving, HDB is monitoring the situation, and will make adjustments where necessary.\" It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

       " {'text': 'covid 19 vaccination effectiveness moh ong ye kung 14869342 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners \"Not quite\" true that the situation in Singapore is \"getting very bad\", says the health minister. SINGAPORE: A total of 78 COVID-19 cases in the current outbreak have been vaccinated - many of whom are frontline workers - compared to about 300 unvaccinated cases, said Health Minister Ong Ye Kung on Sunday (May 23). The numbers represent a ratio of about 79 per cent unvaccinated cases versus 21 per cent vaccinated ones. In a Facebook post that sought to answer what Mr Ong termed \"the most common questions people are asking about COVID-19 in Singapore\", hesaid that international studies continue to show that vaccinations are \"very effective in preventing infections and severe illnesses\". The minister cited the figures in response to the question of whether it is true that many vaccinated people are infected and there is no point getting vaccinated. The other three questions: Whether the new B1617 coronavirus variant from India is \"airborne and very contagious\"; whether the \"situation is getting very bad\"; and whether the situation \"must be bad\" if authorities are testing residents in housing blocks. Regarding the B1617 variant, Mr Ong said the strain\\'s modes of transmission are not unlike COVID-19 in general, which has always been spread when a person \"coughs, sneezes, talks or sings, through droplets and aerosols in the air\". The minister added that various factors affect the risk of transmission, and limited airflow and poor ventilation worsen the spread. A large majority of infections are in enclosed places with close interactions without masks, prompting the authorities to suspend dining out at restaurants and big gatherings. This is \"also why a big proportion of infections now actually come from home\", said Mr Ong. \"To protect your family members, see a doctor immediately if unwell.\" HOW BAD IS THE COVID-19 SITUATION IN SINGAPORE? Mr Ong said it is \"not quite\" true that the \"situation is getting very bad\". Appending a graph showing the three-day moving averages of total community cases and unlinked community cases from May 16 to May 21, Mr Ong said in the post \"we are hovering around the same number since May 16\". May 16 was when Singapore further tightened rules and entered what has been termed\"Phase 2 (Heightened Alert)\". \"But as I had said earlier in a press conference on May 16, we are monitoring the situation closely; to see if we are trending up, down or flat,\" he added. And the fact that the authorities have been conducting special operations, with swab tests conducted for residents of certain HDB blocks, does not mean that the situation \"must be bad\", said the minister. \"Testing is a very effective way to prevent further spread. You should feel safer when you hear all these testing ops. They help us detect and isolate people early, including persons who are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic and would otherwise be missed. \"We will be doing even more testing and surveillance moving forward,\" Mr Ong added.

The penalised companies were among more than 530 workplaces inspected between May 8 and May 21, the ministries said in a press release. On May 8, Singapore reduced the proportion of employees allowed to return to the workplace to 50 per cent, down from 75 per cent. Since May 16, this has been further tightened to working from home as the default. MOM and MTI said they would be increasing inspections of workplaces to ensure that the latest guidelines are properly implemented. In response to CNA\\'s queries, MOM said the 11 companies were issued fines of S$1,000 each. \"MOM is unable to release details of the companies involved,\" said the Manpower Ministry. CNA has contacted MTI for details on the 11 firms that were fined. \"All employees whose roles can be performed from home must do so. Employers must provide the necessary facilities and direct their employees to work from home wherever possible,\" said the ministries. Only employees who are unable to work from home due to the nature of their work, such as requiring access to equipment only available at the workplace, can continue to work on-site, they added. MOM and MTI also reminded all employers who carry out operations on-site to declare their manpower details onlineby May 28and update the information whenever there are significant changes. \"Regardless of the declared number of workers, it is the employer\\'s responsibility to ensure that all employees (work from home) if they are able to do so,\" said the ministries. Enforcement actionwill be taken against the employerif workers who are able to work from homeare found working on-site. This is even if the total number of workers on-site is at or below the declared number of workers,said the ministries. Under the tightened regulations, which are in place through Jun 13, social gatherings at the workplace are also not allowed. Employees can have meal breaks in the workplaces but these should be taken individually and at staggered times. Employers should continue to stagger the start times of employees who need to return to the workplace and implement flexible working hours. There should also be no cross-deployment of workers across workplaces or worksites. Masks must continue to be worn at the workplace at all times. Breaches of workplace safety measures can be reported through the SnapSAFE app. The identities of whistle-blowers will be kept strictly confidential, said the ministries.

Home gatherings will be limited to five guests, only 30 people allowed at public meetings, and face masks will be mandatory indoors from 6pmlocal time (4pm, Singapore time) on Tuesday until Jun4. \"This is a responsible step that we need to take to get on top of this outbreak,\" James Merlino, Victoria state\\'s acting premier, told reporters in Melbourne. The latest Melbourne outbreak ends Victoria state\\'s run of zero cases for nearly three months. Victoria was the hardest-hit state during a second wave late last year, accounting for about 70 per cent of total cases and 90 per cent of deaths in Australia. The state, the country\\'s second-most populous, only controlled the outbreak after one of the world\\'s longest and strictest lockdowns. One new locally acquired case has been reported in Melbourne, Merlino said on Tuesday, a day after four infections were reported in the city. All five cases belong to one extended family across different households and could be traced back to the variant found in an overseas traveller who returned to Melbourne early this month after completing quarantine in the city of Adelaide. Authorities, however, said that they could not yet find how the latest cases contracted the virus from the overseas traveller. Thousands have been ordered to self-isolate and undergo COVID-19 tests with health alerts issued for several sites, including one of the largest shopping centres in the country. One of the cases had a high viral load while he visited some venues, prompting authorities to warn Melbourne\\'s 5million residents to brace for more positive cases in the next few days. Speedy tracing systems, movement curbs and social distancing have largely helped Australia contain COVID-19 outbreaks. It has recorded just over 30,000 cases and 910 deaths since the pandemic began.

In a Facebook post, Mr Chan said he understands \"the challenges that our students who wish to study in foreign universities are facing\", with COVID-19 disrupting some of their plans. \"As in 2020, we will similarly give our local autonomous universities some flexibility to admit more students this year,\" he added. The autonomous universities comprise Nanyang Technological University, National University of Singapore, Singapore Institute of Technology, Singapore Management University, Singapore University of Social Sciences, and Singapore University of Technology and Design. The six universities\"will continue to uphold admission standards, and ensure a high quality of education\", said the minister. The Ministry of Education (MOE) \"will continue to monitor the global COVID-19 situation\" and work closely with the autonomous universities \"to support our students\", he added. Applications for admission to the schools closed in March this year, followed bythe option to appeal the outcome. Last year, the application window was extended by two months from March to mid-May to accommodate fresh school-leavers who had planned to study overseas. More enrolment places - around 2,000 offers - were also set aside in the academic year starting in 2020, according to MOE. Responding to CNA queries, the Ministry of Education said it is working closely with all six autonomous universities to “size the appropriate number of places” by “monitoring applicant quality and student demand” in the ongoing admissions exercise for the 2021 academic year. “The allocation of additional places across the universities and courses will take into account relevant factors such as the quality of the applicant pool, areas or disciplines with strong student interest and employment prospects, and the AUs’ capacity to take in more students,” said a MOE spokesperson.

This would bring the total number tested to 8,500. The second-year student from the School of Chemical & Life Sciences (CLS) had developed a fever on May 19 and consulted a doctor on the same day, where she was tested positive for COVID-19. She was last on campus on Saturday morning. “The Ministry of Health (MOH) assessed that she was not infectious when she was last on campus,” said Singapore Polytechnic in a statement on Thursday, adding that the school was in touch with the student to provide the necessary support. Singapore Polytechnic is alreadyundertaking a swabbing exercise for 6,500 students, staff members and vendorsafter three students had tested positive for COVID-19. All classes have been moved online since Tuesday. “As an added precautionary measure arising from the latest case, MOH will expand the first phase of swabbing to cover students and staff from CLS as well,” said Singapore Polytechnic. “This expansion is expected to include 2,000 more individuals, to further reduce the risk of transmission within our campus and community.” Once the first phase of the swabbing exercise is complete, MOH will assess if there is a need to proceed with the swabbing exercise for the rest of Singapore Polytechnic community, the school said. Individuals will be notified by MOH via SMS on the details of their swab tests, it added. “SP strongly encourages those who have been identified to be swabbed to do so, for your own safety and the safety of our campus and the larger community,” the school said.

       " {'text': \"covid 19 singapore emerging stronger taskforce recovery 14825850 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: Singapore must create new frontiers in the digital realm and seize opportunities in a growing green economy, said a government task force on how Singapore can chart its economic recovery in a post-pandemic world. The Emerging Stronger Taskforce also recommended that a new public-private partnership that it piloted be institutionalised and for Singapore to strengthen its ties with the region. These recommendations were laid out in a 118-page report issued on Monday (May 17) by the task force following a year of deliberations. Formed in May last year, the Emerging Stronger Taskforce said its vision for the Singapore economy is one that “offers limitless possibilities and opportunities for our nation, our businesses and our people”. “This will be a new way for Singapore to strengthen our economic linkages with the world, and spur our transformation into a Global-Asia node of technology, innovation, and enterprise,” it said in a press release from the Ministry of Trade and Industry. ABOUT THE TASK FORCE The task force is chaired by Minister for National Development Desmond Lee and PSA International Group chief executive Tan Chong Meng, and also includes 21 other members from the private and public sectors. As part of its work, it first identified six key shifts arising from the pandemic – a changing global order, accelerating industry consolidation, a rebalance between efficiency and resilience in supply chains and production, accelerating digital transformation and innovation, changes in consumer preferences and an increased focus on environmental and social sustainability. It then zeroed in on areas that it thinks Singapore could invest in before forming nine industry-led alliances to quickly test-bed ideas. These Singapore Together Alliances for Action (AfAs), as they were called, represented a “new model of private-public partnership” which aimed to deliver “minimum viable products” using an agile start-up approach. Over the past year, the task force consulted nearly 2,000 individuals from more than 900 businesses, trade associations and chambers, unions and institutes of higher learning. Speaking at a press conference to mark the launch of the task force’s report, Mr Lee said battling uncertainties arising from the pandemic could shorten one’s field of vision but this presents risks, especially for small countries like Singapore. “We don't want to look up when the crisis begins to abate … and realise that the world has changed around us and we had this very short-term view,” the minister said. “So this guided the work of the (task force) and our central question was what must we do to ensure that Singapore emerges from this crisis stronger.” THE 5 RECOMMENDATIONS In its report, the task force said its economic vision is for a “virtually unlimited Singapore” but this will only be possible if the country can “find ways to be of value” to others. “We cannot compete on technology alone, but by creating and providing services in areas which play to our strengths of trust, speed, consistency, and systems-level coordination,” it wrote. “This will be a new way for Singapore to strengthen our economic linkages with the world, and serve as a vital node at the intersection of high-value global trade, finance, digital, data, technology, and talent flows.” Singapore must also resist anti-globalisation and protectionism forces by remaining open, particularly to global talent and skills, the task force’s report said. This is so that Singaporeans can continue to learn from the best in the world, while companies can access the best ideas and understand consumers and businesses beyond Singapore. 1. Create new virtual frontiers Singapore can build on its digitalisation journey and take its Smart Nation aspirations global, the task force recommended. For one, a virtual marketplace can be built to support local enterprises in creating new products and digital experiences, and participate in the “trusted trade of goods and services”. There is “immense potential” to do so, given the country’s digital connectivity as well as the trust and reliability associated with the Singapore brand, the report said. Amid the rising prospects of a global remote workforce, virtual training and workforce solutions can be used to help companies tap on global talent to better serve demand around the world from Singapore. This may also open up new opportunities for Singaporeans to work beyond the country’s shores, said the task force. Singapore can also redefine its relevance as a safe and smart city for trade, business, work and leisure as it looks to resume safe travel through the use of technology. The report cited the industry-led alliance that piloted innovative solutions in the meetings, incentives, conventions and exhibitions (MICE) sector. Through the development of digital tools and redesigning of safe business events and leisure itineraries, a number of trade shows such as the Singapore International Energy Week were held amid the pandemic last year. 2. Seizing growth opportunities in sustainability The task force proposed making a concerted push to establish Singapore as a carbon trading and services hub. “This entails developing a carbon marketplace built on quality and trust, that addresses gaps in the voluntary carbon market, establishing a one-stop solution for companies to measure, mitigate, and offset their carbon footprint, and convening partnerships to capture opportunities through research and innovation,” it wrote. A new “infrastructure company” related to this will be announced later this week, according to Mr Piyush Gupta, chief executive officer of DBS and a member of the task force. The country should also strengthen food resilience through agri-tech. This can be done by improving the economic viability and sustainability of indoor vertical farming in Singapore, as well as identifying broader agri-tech opportunities that Singapore should invest in and attain leadership in over the coming years. The traceability and accountability of industry value chains should also be strengthened through “end-to-end digitalisation”, the task force said. This includes establishing common standards to facilitate data flow, which will help partners across the ecosystem to make better decisions on optimising asset deployment and their environment impact. 3. Enabling global champions and growing an agile, strong “Singapore core” The Government should support the growth of a pool of innovative and international Large Local Enterprises through innovation, internationalisation, mergers and acquisitions, and talent development. It must also enable “a broad base of companies” to succeed, especially small- and medium-sized enterprises and microenterprises, so as to create good jobs for Singaporeans. But more can be done with “support from industry, for industry”, said the task force. It recommended the leveraging of “queen bee” companies including in the area of training and upskilling, as well as the use of commercial frameworks to bring along smaller companies or suppliers in their respective ecosystems or value chains. This should be augmented by the Government providing digital infrastructure, such as common data or digital platforms, to enable all companies can access best-in-class practices, technology and resources. Businesses, training providers, institutes of higher learning and unions should also play a bigger and more sustained role in upskilling and creating career progression pathways for workers, the report said. For instance, businesses can work with unions to adopt “a preventive or predictive upskilling approach” to identify job disruption and training needs early on, and develop workforce training plans. More can also be done to help workers take ownership of their own skill journeys, to identify and bridge gaps in their current skills in order to move into redesigned or higher-value work. Still, as the local workforce is being developed, Singapore “must remain open to skills from abroad to complement our workforce”, the task force said. Mr Lee cited the built environment sector as an example, where industry transformation meant that new skill sets are in demand, and foreign talent will have to be brought in to enable skills and knowledge transfer. For instance, the building of three-dimension (3D) models for construction projects requires modellers and designers who can design and translate architectural concepts and layouts into these models. It also needs another team that can work on pre-fabrication and precast design, including the possibility of “building an entire room in a factory and finishing it off before bringing it on site”. “So (this) totally changes the way in which we seek to build and this is already happening,” he said. “We are building a core of local workers to do that but we've had to supplement it with people from abroad to enable us to grow that opportunity.” 4. Institutionalise the Singapore Together AfA model The task force said its industry-led alliances, which taps on the complementary strengths of private and public sector stakeholders, has seen initial success and should be institutionalised. But given that it is a “relatively new modus operandi spurred by the COVID-19 crisis”, it should be further nurtured to ensure its adoption and effectiveness in the economic realm. “Early learning points from the EST’s AfAs should be taken into account to strengthen the execution of future AfAs, and key criteria should be set for commissioning and closing AfAs,” it wrote in its report. It also recommended that future alliances in the economic domain be primarily, but not exclusively, established under the Future Economy Council to serve as an additional platform for private-public collaboration and a key enabler for transformative economic growth. That said, in line with the model’s “start-up” approach, one should be prepared that not every of these alliances will succeed in delivering outcomes. “We should therefore expect and be open to AfAs ‘graduating’ in different ways,” the task force said. 5. Strengthen international partnerships, especially with Southeast Asia Singapore should also position itself as a partner for recovery and growth, and foster “win-win” partnerships with its closest neighbours. This is why the task force recommended that Singapore partner countries in the region, including at the business-to-business level, and deepen its engagement and knowledge of the region. It also suggested strengthening digital connectivity across Southeast Asia towards a “single digital area”. This can be done by riding on existing government efforts and engagements with ASEAN that set out stronger digital integration in the area of data flows, promote regional recovery through inclusive digital transformation and enhance cybersecurity cooperation. A “VISIONARY” REPORT: HENG SWEE KEAT The Future Economy Council, which the task force reports to, said it has accepted the recommendations and will incorporate them into its work, particularly the Industry Transformation Maps 2025. “In particular, we will institutionalise and scale the Alliances for Action as a more agile and nimble way to undertake industry transformation,” said Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat, who chairs the council. This industry-led alliance model is also being piloted beyond the economic sphere, with Mr Lee driving the Singapore Together movement with Second Minister for Finance and National Development Indranee Rajah, he added. The Singapore Together movement was announced by Mr Heng in 2019 as part of the fourth-generation leaders’ new strategy of getting Singaporeans involved in policymaking. Mr Heng, who is also Coordinating Minister for Economic Policies, described the task force’s report as “visionary” and “timely” as the country battles both near-term challenges brought about by the pandemic and longer-term risks. “This is only the beginning of the next bout of economic transformation that we are embarking on,” he said. “As COVID-19 is likely to stay with us in some form and for some time, it is critical that our businesses and workers take this downtime to accelerate our learning and transformation, and form new partnerships.” It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

       " {'text': \"rules tightened singapore circuit breaker covid 19 fatigue 14831062 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners The changing rules of this COVID-19 threat could mean on-off restrictions and the need for resilience to get through this pandemic. SINGAPORE: There is something extraordinary in the way Singapore’s national response to a raging pandemic runs like clockwork. Take last week for example. The announcement of tightened restrictions last Friday (May 14) by the multi-ministry task force came as little surprise to many. As daily new infections ticked up over the past two weeks, people were already getting into position for some sort of a coming winter. Close friends WhatsApped me last week to postpone dinner plans until infection numbers die down. My mother instinctively went to see my grandmother, just in case she could no longer do so if rules disallowed visits. And when she dropped by our neighbourhood hair salon to get a trim on Thursday, the owner shared how he had stayed open despite earlier plans to close for the public holiday, anticipating a surge in customers and potentially having to shutter if another circuit breaker was pulled. When Friday’s announcement was made, most people's reactions were marked by readiness rather than alarm. Lines at supermarkets grew but were nowhere near panic-buying levels seen last April and quickly died down. Workplaces shifted into work-from-home mode somewhat seamlessly. In fact, it looked like the pandemic has made us pretty agile and responsive to change. Businesses, workers and people were reading the tea leaves, readying ourselves and taking actionto mitigate risks even before we moved into what the Government calls Phase 2 (Heightened Alert). Even Sunday’s announcement of schools moving to home-based learning (HBL) came as little surprise to parents who had discussed that eventuality extensively over the past week as the exam season concluded and after school and tuition centre clusters emerged. WORRIES AND FATIGUE AS THE RULES OF THE COVID-19 GAME KEEP CHANGING That preparedness, however, may belie some of theunderlying feelings arising from keeping up with the relentless, shifting challenges thrown up by COVID-19. Some frontline healthcare workers have been pushed to their limits. Concerns over livelihoods remain as sectors including F&B, the arts and the construction industry are impacted by restrictions. It looks like the email address you entered is not valid. Such worries may be taking a toll on general well-being. Singaporeans are sleeping worse since the pandemic. More than a third say the pandemic has hiked stress levels and impacted their emotional health. About four in ten reported having troubles falling asleep and waking up at night according to a Philips study of 1,000 surveyed here in end-2020. The most frustrating part of living in a COVID-19 world is the changing rules of the game. Each time we think we have turned a corner, some new development threatens to undermine past efforts. For months, community cases in Singapore were near-zero. We had cruises and concerts. The national conversation was on whether travel restrictions could be relaxed with vaccination. That second shot at an air travel bubble with Hong Kong had looked promising. While not surprising, the shift in Singapore’s posture is a frustrating reminder of our never-ending fight with COVID-19. The operating assumptions and organising principles on which our national response rely on has had to adjust a few times when the scientific consensus on the virus’ characteristics took time to emerge. From the World Health Organization confirming the novel coronavirus spread at the onset of an infection and asymptomatically unlike SARS to the need for mask-wearing, that dynamic was an uncomfortable constant when the virus first reared its head. VARIANTS POSE NEW CHALLENGES The new spanner in the works is a range of mutated strains. New variants may be harder to control than older strains, being more transmissible, Duke-NUS Medical School Professor Gavin Smith said on CNA’s Heart of the Matter podcast two weeks ago. There is also evidence more antibodies are needed to kill the virus compared to older strains, which could be reflected in reduced efficacy of the vaccines, he added. The bigger challenge posed by mutated strains goes beyond tackling immediate cases and requires a good hard look at how to address fatigue to ensure compliance for the long term, when experts have pointed out the virus is evolving to become endemic. “We can deal with a particular surge but in the long-run, if a variant can bypass measures in place, because people are no longer protecting themselves with masks and distancing ... that’s what I’m most concerned about,” Professor David Matchar highlighted in the same podcast episode. We also know that the announced HBL has been generally accepted because parents are aware it will only last one and a half weeks. But given how the B1617 strain appears to affect children more, what if infections do not let up and schools reopen after the June holidays to require HBL? (Are COVID-19 vaccines still effective against new variants? And could these increase the risk of reinfection? Listen to the full conversation with Profs David Matchar and Gavin Smith on on CNA's Heart of the Matter podcast.) NO STRAIGHT-LINE PATH TO NORMALITY Perhaps to expect Singapore to continue on an uninterrupted path to normality was something we all desired but is an impractical wish. We are in a good place. Our national strategy has evolved to a considered system of safe-distancing, rigorous testing and rapid contract-tracing, underpinned by a fortuitous mix of ripened technology, responsive public policy and general public compliance. Errant lawbreakers are called out and people are generally cooperative. We have also seen 1.3 million people fully vaccinated. But the agonising reality of keeping pacewith an evolving virus could mean regular reintroductions of restrictions to curb the spread when cases slip through the cracks or if the virus evolves further, taking a evidence-based approach to calibrate and target measures to avoid impacting people and livelihoods where possible. In this, Health Minister Ong Ye Kung’s response on Sunday cautioning against pulling a circuit breaker and urging for cool heads and the passage of sufficient time to see if removing high-risk settings can tackle the current surge is one to be welcomed. After all, the two-month circuit breaker was hell for vulnerable groups stuck at home and came at a substantial social, economic and emotional cost. Let’s also remember blunt measures, like tightening travel restrictions can scarcely be a sustainable solution. “You can completely shut off Singapore for a few months and feel secured there is no community transmission. But once you reopen borders, there’s always going to be a risk because there are outbreaks elsewhere in the world”, Prof Smith reminded me. Families whose Build-to-Order flats have been delayed and are unable to hire new foreign domestic workers know closing off Singapore cancost them dearly. Construction firms are feeling the pain of entry restrictions on foreign workers. There is some fatigue and some frustration in Singapore. But an overall willingness to stay alert, keep our guards up and do our part is what will get us through this pandemic. The key challenge is sustaining this as the journey continues.

This is the highest number of community cases reported since Apr 14 last yearwhen 40 community infectionswere reported. Singapore\\'s \"circuit breaker\" started on Apr 7, 2020. Twenty-one of the new community cases are linked to previous infectionsand the remaining 17 are unlinked.Of the new community cases,13 people were placed in quarantine earlier, saidthe ministry. B1617 VARIANT Six of the seven cases that tested preliminarily positive for the B1617 variantwere unlinked cases. They include a 54-year-old Malaysian woman who works at Sms Infocomm (Singapore), a 55-year-old Singaporean man who works as a driver at KEN Express Services, a 52-year-old permanent resident who works as a Certis Ciscoauxiliary police officer at the Bank of China in Westgate, anda 57-year-oldMalaysian woman who is unemployed. There is alsoa 34-year-oldSingaporean man who works at ST Telemedia Global Data Centresand a 29-year-old Singaporean man who works as a digital web designer. The linkedcase that tested preliminarily positive for the variant is a Filipino man who works as a sales representative at JR Life Sciences. He had visitedChangi Airport Terminal 3 on May 4 and isamong the six new cases linked to the cluster there. LEARNING POINT CENTRE CLUSTER Nine new cases were linked to the cluster at the Learning Point centre. Among them are four students aged between eight and nine years. Two of the students are from Kong Hwa School, one is from Yu Neng Primary School and the remaining one is from St Margaret\\'s Primary School. All four had attended classes at the tuition centre in Parkway Centre taught by a 50-year-oldtutor, who was the first detected case in the cluster. They were placed in quarantine on May 13 before testing positive for COVID-19. The remaining five newcases in the cluster are family members and household contacts of previous cases. The Learning Point cluster now has 18 confirmed cases. CHANGI AIRPORT CLUSTER GROWS Six more cases have been linked to the cluster at Changi Airport, including a one-year-old Singaporean boy who was placed onquarantine on May 13. He is a family member ofCase 63146, a Gojek driver who had visited Changi Airport Terminal 3 on May 6. The boydeveloped a fever and a runny nose on May 15. The other five cases were detected through surveillance testing. They include a 37-year-old Filipino manand a 39-year-old Filipino nurse working at Ren Ci Nursing Home (Ang Mo Kio)who is a household contact of a previous case. The three remaining cases are employees deployed at Terminal 3 -a36-year-old stall assistant at the Kopitiam outlet, a 66-year-old aviation security officer and a 26-year-old retail store sales associate. OTHER COMMUNITY CASES The remaining community cases reported on Sunday include a Singapore Polytechnic student,a nurse at Raffles Hospital and an employee at Sheng Siong supermarket in Bukit Batok. All are unlinked cases. Twodealers at Marina Bay Sands Casino also tested positive for COVID-19. MOH has also identified two new clusters - one at Changi Prison Complex and anotherlinked to a cook at aWok Hey outlet at White Sands mall. A total of 11cases reported on Sunday were importedand were placed on stay-home notice or isolated upon their arrival in Singapore. Five are returning permanent residentswho had arrived from India. Another five cases are work permit holders, including fourdomestic workers, who travelledfrom Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines. There is a special pass holder,a sea crew member, whoarrived from the United Arab Emirates on a vessel. He was tested onboard. No new infections were reported in foreign workers\\' dormitories. More details can be found in the health ministry’s daily situation report. INCREASE IN UNLINKED CASES MOH said the number of new cases in the community has increased from 39 in the week before to 131 in the past week. The number of unlinked cases has also increased from six in the week before to 32 in the past week. Forty-two more cases have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities, bringing Singapore\\'s total recoveries to61,104. There are 207 cases still in hospital, most of whom are stable or improving. Two are in critical condition in the intensive care unit. Another 243 are isolated and cared for at community facilities. FULL HOME-BASED LEARNING FROM MAY 19 It was announced earlier on Sunday that primary and secondary schools, as well as junior colleges, will move to full home-based learning starting on Wednesday until the end of term. The move, which will also apply tospecial education schools, comes after several primary school students tested positive for COVID-19 in recent days. Pre-schools and student care centres will remain open to support families who need these services, said Minister for Education Chan Chun Sing. Institutes of higher learning will reduce attendance on campus by converting more classes online where possible, except for essential in-person sessions like labs, practicals and final-year projects, he added. All centre-based tuition and enrichment classes should move activities online until the end of Phase 2 (Heightened Alert), said the Ministry of Education. Tighter restrictions to curb the spread of the coronavirus in the community kicked in on Sunday and will last until Jun 13. Under the Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) rules, group gatherings are capped at two, down from five previously. Households are allowed to receive only two distinct visitors a day, down from the previous limit of five. Dining-in atfood outlets is suspended. As of Sunday, Singapore has reported a total of 61,585 COVID-19 cases and 31 fatalities from the disease.

       " {'text': \"grab increase fares one dollar improve driver earnings covid 19 14880512 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: From June, passengers using ride-hailing platform Grab will have to pay an additional S$1 as the Singapore-based firm says it wants to improve earnings for its drivers. The increase - which will apply to all its transport services except the standard taxi, GrabHitch and GrabCoach options on its app - will take effect from Jun 1, with 100 per cent of the S$1 going to drivers for the month of June 2021. Grab, which typically takes about 20 per cent of each fare, said it will not collect commissions from this S$1 during this period. “This move comes after deep discussions with driver-partners and tripartite partners, who have feedback that Grab’s transport fares have not kept up with drivers’ rising costs of providing the service,” said the ride-hailing giant in a media release on Tuesday (May 25), pointing to the increasing costs in areas such as fuel, maintenance and repair. “The revision aims to improve earnings for driver-partners, enabling them to continue providing safe and high-quality service for passengers in a financially viable manner for the longer term,” said Grab, noting it has not revised its transport fares since 2017. In September 2018, the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (CCCS) imposed a freeze on Grab's pricing mechanism after its deal with Uber was found to have infringed the Competition Act. CCCS lifted these and other restrictions in November last year after the introduction of a new regulatory framework for the point-to-point transportation industry, with Grab announcing it would introduce a S$0.30 platform fee to its rides. To help consumers adjust to the new fare structure, Grab said it would offer S$1 vouchers for peak hour rides between Jun 1 and Jun 14. The Singapore-based firm noted ridership “plummeted drastically” last year, with ridership yet to return to pre-pandemic levels. Ridership has declined since Singapore went into its Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) period earlier this month, aimed at addressing a spike in COVID-19 cases. To increase their earning opportunities, Grab is also encouraging its drivers to take on delivery jobs through its GrabFood, GrabMart and GrabExpress services. The authorities announced last year that taxi and private-hire drivers would be allowed to do deliveries until the end of September this year, amid a decline in passengers and an increase in demand for delivery services during the coronavirus crisis. “Grab will be providing additional incentives for driver-partners who complete delivery jobs in designated high demand areas,” the firm said. “Many of our driver-partners have expressed worries and concern over the viability of their livelihood on the platform as the volatile pandemic situation continues,” said Grab Singapore transport managing director Andrew Chan. “Many driver-partners have pivoted to also taking on delivery jobs to supplement their earningsand Grab wants to show further support by introducing short-term initiatives to reduce their financial stress during this period.” It added that eligible drivers leasing their vehicles through its vehicle rental arm GrabRentals can also benefit from a rental rebate of up to S$45 per week, depending on their current rental fees. Grab said six of its fleet partners - Lion City Rentals, AutoExchange Leasing, KH Leasing, MS Carz Leasing, Prime Transport & Limousine Services and Roset Limousine Services - have also committed to offering rental rebates for eligible hirers. Drivers will also be entitled to cash rebates based on the total number of transport and delivery jobs they complete during “pre-designated hours”, it said, adding that it will maintain its current driver benefits programme until September this year. “We trust that this holistic approach of lowering costs, increasing earning opportunities and enhancing their safety net will address the main challenges our driver-partners are facing right now and better protect them for the future,” said Grab’s Mr Chan. Last Friday the Land Transport Authority said that taxi and private-hire car drivers whose incomes have been affected by the heightened COVID-19 restrictions would receive an additional S$27 million from the Government through the COVID-19 driver relief fund until the end of June this year. This is on top of the S$188 million already committed for payments through the fund, allowing drivers to receive S$25 per vehicle per day as part of support for the beleaguered industry.

       " {'text': 'covid 19 hong kong could bin millions unused vaccine doses 14881080 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners HONG KONG:Hong Kong may soon have to throw away millions of COVID-19 vaccine doses because they are approaching their expiry date and not enough people have signed up for the jabs, an official warned on Tuesday (May 25). Hong Kong is one of the few places in the world fortunate enough to have secured more than enough doses to innoculate its entire population of 7.5 million people. But swirling distrust of the government as it stamps out dissent -combined with online misinformation and a lack of urgency in the comparatively virus-free city - has led to entrenched vaccine hesitancy and a dismal inoculation drive. On Tuesday a member of the government\\'s vaccine task force warned that Hong Kong residents\"only have a three-month window\" before the city\\'s first batch of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines go out of date. \"The vaccines all have expiry dates,\" Thomas Tsang, a former controller of the Centre for Health Protection, told RTHK radio. \"They cannot be used after the expiry date and the community vaccination centres for BioNTech will, according to present plans, cease operating after September.\" Tsang said it was \"just not right\" that Hong Kong was sitting on an unused pile of doses while the rest of the world \"is scrambling for vaccines\". And he warned new doses were unlikely to be delivered. \"What we have is probably all we have for the rest of the year,\" he said. Hong Kong bought 7.5 million doses each of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and China\\'s Sinovac vaccine. The latter has yet to be approved by the World Health Organization but was fast-tracked for use by city health regulators. It also pre-ordered 7.5 million doses of AstraZeneca jabs but scrapped that deal earlier in the year with authorities saying they planned to use the money for second-generation vaccines next year. MEDICAL WORKER RESISTANCE So far, just 19 per cent of the population has received one dose of either vaccine while 14 per cent have received two doses. Hesitancy is common even among the city\\'s medical workers. Earlier this month, the city\\'s Hospital Authority revealed that only a third of its staff had taken the opportunity to be vaccinated. There are currently millions of unused Pfizer-BioNTech shots, which must be stored at ultra-low temperatures and have a six-month shelf life. A total of 3,263,000 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccinehave been shipped to Hong Kong so far, but only 1,231,600 have been administered. Hong Kong\\'s vaccine hesitancy comes as many nearby countries are scrambling to secure enough doses as the coronavirus wreaks havoc. In recent weeks, some Hong Kong politicians have suggested that the city could look to send unused vaccines overseas if take-up does not improve. Public trust in the Hong Kong government has been at a historic low since Beijing and local authorities cracked down on dissent to end huge and often violent protests that broke out in 2019. Officials have also struggled to come up with incentives to encourage vaccination in a city where long quarantine measures and economically painful social distancing rules have kept infections low. Instead officials have largely put the onus on businesses to push employees into vaccinating. Earlier this year the government announced HK$5,000 (US$640) spending vouchers for all residents as a way to boost the economy. Some critics suggested the government should either link those vouchers to vaccination certificates - or provide further cash handouts for the inoculated. However, on Tuesday city leader Carrie Lam rejected that suggestion. \"To offer cash or something physical to encourage vaccination shouldn\\'t be done by the government and may even cause the opposite effect,\" she said.

The deferment comes amid a recent increase in unlinked COVID-19 community cases in Singapore. The countryis \"unable to meet the criteria to start\" the air travel bubble, said Singapore\\'s Ministry of Transport (MOT) on Monday (May 17). The authorities will review a new launch date towards the end of Phase 2 (Heightened Alert), which runs to Jun 13. The air travel bubble, which was initially due to launch on Nov 22last year, was deferredafter a rise in COVID-19 cases in Hong Kong. Both cities announced on Apr 26 –before the increase in unlinked community cases in Singapore –that the travel bubble would resume on May 26. Under the terms of the agreement, the travel bubble will be suspended for at least 14 days if the seven-day moving average of unlinked local COVID-19 cases a day, excluding dormitory resident cases in Singapore, is more than five in either Singapore or Hong Kong.

SINGAPORE ON KNIFE-EDGE In ministerial statements in Parliament on Tuesday, Education Minister Lawrence Wong and Health Minister Gan Kim Yong provided updates on the COVID-19 situation in Singapore. MrWong said that Singapore is now on aknife-edge, with community case numbers that could go either way over the next few weeks. While Singapore has a chance of “getting things under control” by the end of the month, it only takes \"one lapse or one irresponsible action\" for an infection to happen, he said. As of May 9, about 1.8 million people in Singapore have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, with 1.2 million of them receiving their second dose, saidMr Gan in his statement.

       " {'text': 'covid 19 phase 2 dining in work from home tightened measures 14808382 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: The current size of group gatherings allowed will be reduced from five people to two people, following a spike in COVID-19 community cases, said co-chair of themulti-ministry task forceLawrence Wong on Friday (May 14). This, and other new measures under what the Health Ministry labelled as \"Phase 2 (Heightened Alert)\" will take effect from May 16 through Jun 13. Speaking at a multi-ministry task force press conference on Friday, Mr Wong said: “This will apply across the board, so if you want to go out for anything, grocery shopping, exercise, maximum of two persons henceforth. “In fact, we strongly encourage everyone to stay home as much as possible, go out only for essential reasons. “We will do a review at the midway point, meaning two weeks after the measures have been implemented, and at that point, we will look at the prevailing public health situation and see if there’s a need to adjust the measures further,” said Mr Wong, who is also Education Minister. Responding to questions about whether Singapore could enter another “circuit breaker” after the midpoint review, Mr Wong said: “If indeed the situation does not improve, we certainly will not rule out even more stringent measures thereafter. “But there is also a chance that things may improve, and therefore, we may also consider the other way around, easing some of the restrictions.” “We are in a stage of heightened alert. I would urge everyone to be vigilant and minimise unnecessary social interactions,” said Health Minister Gan Kim Yong. “We need to act decisively to disrupt the virus transmission. We will therefore further tighten safe management measures in the community” DINING-IN SUSPENDED, WORK-FROM-HOME AS DEFAULT Dining-in at F&B establishments will also not be allowed, said Mr Wong. This includes hawker centres and food courts, both indoors and outdoors. “We will take tighter measures around the higher-risk settings, and these higher-risk settings are the ones where people are gathered together in an indoor environment without their mask on,” said Mr Wong. “All dining-in will have to cease … All F&B establishments will only be able to offer takeaway and delivery options. In line with this, wedding banquets will also have to cease because it’s a dining activity.” Working from home will also be the default at workplaces, he added. “All employees who are able to work from home will have to do so. Work-from-home will be the default.” The cap of five distinct visitors per household per day will also be reduced to two distinct visitors per household per day, Mr Wong said. “Individuals should continue to limit their overall number of social gatherings to not more than two per day, whether to another household, or meeting with friends and family members in a public place,” said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a separate press release. Grandchildren being cared for by their grandparents on a daily basis would not count towards the cap of two distinct visitors or the number of social gatherings per day, said MOH in the press release. “However, grandparents are strongly encouraged to be vaccinated against COVID-19, to protect both themselves and their grandchildren from COVID-19 infection. To reduce the risk of transmission, grandparents should also minimise intermingling between grandchildren from different households,” said the Health Ministry. Other activities that will not be allowed during this period include strenuous indoor exercise classes, or strenuous individual and group indoor sports and exercise activities, said MOH in the press release. Personalised services that need masks to be removed like facials and saunas, singing and playing instruments that need “require intentional expulsion of air” like wind or brass instruments, will also not be allowed. However, medical and dental services can continue, the press release noted. EVENT SIZES AND PRE-EVENT TESTING Event sizes and event size caps will be further scaled down, said Mr Wong. Currently, events can have 100 attendees without pre-event testing and 250 with pre-event testing. This will be scaled down to 50 and 100 attendees respectively, he added. This will apply to congregational and other worship services and MICE activities, said Mr Wong. “Likewise, we will reduce the capacity limits across the board for shopping malls, showrooms and attractions, as well as cruises, museums, public libraries, all of these capacity limits will be scaled back,” he added. For congregational and other worship services, religious workers and all other participants must wear their masks at all times “to further mitigate the risk of spread through aerosol transmissions”, said MOH in the press release. Live singing and playing of wind instruments will also be suspended during this period. The operating capacity of attractions that have received prior approval from the Ministry of Trade and Industry will be reduced to 25 per cent from the current 50 per cent. Museums and public libraries will also be allowed to operate at a reduced capacity of 25per cent.Indoor and outdoor shows can proceed with up to 100 people with pre-event testing and up to 50 without, said MOH. This also applies to cinemas, but the group size of two people applies. Food and beverages also cannot be sold or consumed in the cinema.The cap for funeral attendees will also be reduced from the current 30 people to 20 people, said MOH in the press release. Marriage solemnisations will be allowed to continue, with a cap of 50 and 100 attendees without and with pre-event testing respectively, the press release read. “We know that there is one group who will be particularly impacted too, which are wedding couples. Some of them may already have wedding plans for this coming Sunday, and it may be very hard to make last-minute changes,” said Mr Wong. For affected couples, the Government is “prepared to consider grandfathering the arrangement” for couples who have already made plans for Sunday, he added. “They can proceed, but we will require them to put in place pre-event testing for all their guests. But this is a special arrangement only for this Sunday because this is a once in a lifetime event for the wedding couples.” The measures announced on Friday are “already very stringent”, said Mr Wong. “If everyone cooperates and we all do our part, we will be able to bring down the latest clusters and cases and bring the infection under control.” Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said separately on Friday that people in Singapore should stay at home \"as far as possible\" and go out only for essential tasks as well as follow government advisories. \"If you do go out, remember to practise safe distancing measures, like using TraceTogether and wearing a mask,\" he said in a Facebook post. \"The new clusters and unlinked community cases in the past fortnight are very worrying. We are testing more intensively, and doing our utmost to ring-fence the transmissions. But we also need stricter restrictions to stop more cases from popping up.\" Mr Lee also urged members of the public to get vaccinated in order to protect themselves and their loved ones. \"The new measures will be difficult for everybody. But if we all play our part and look out for one another, we will succeed in stemming the transmission of the virus, just like we did last year,\" he added.

       " {'text': \"lawrence wong covid 19 knife edge community cases 14786090 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: Singapore is now on a knife-edge, with community case numbers that could go either way over the next few weeks, said Minister for Education Lawrence Wong in Parliament on Tuesday (May 11). In a ministerial statement on the Government’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Mr Wong said Singapore has a chance of “getting things under control” by the end of the month – referring to a rise in local community cases over the past few weeks, such as recent clusters related to Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) and Changi Airport. “But as we know from experience, it only takes one lapse or one irresponsible action for an infection to happen; and that infection may end up being a super-spreader event in the community,” said Mr Wong, who is the co-chair of the multi-ministry task force dealing with COVID-19. He added that “a full suite” of protective community measures isneeded, as even the tightest of border controls might still see imported cases leaking into the country. For example, when new cases pop up, close contacts are immediately isolated and ring-fenced, with a wide net of testing conducted for all persons with possible exposure to the infected case. Even with these efforts, there will be a few occasions where more general movement restrictions will be needed – as was the case with the TTSH cluster, he said. Mr Wong said that in thatinstance,authorities could not be sure if there were still hidden cases out there in the community, even after efforts to ring-fence cases. He acknowledged the fact that such measures pose “considerable inconvenience” to Singaporeans. “There are several public holidays coming up in the month of May ... I know in particular this must be very disappointing for our Malay-Muslim community – having to observe these strict rules during Hari Raya and to curtail your normal family visits for a second year. “Likewise for the Buddhist community during Vesak Day. I hope everyone understands why the latest measures are necessary. I thank everyone for taking the latest measures in your stride and seek your cooperation to abide by the rules – not just with the letter of the law but also the spirit of it,” he said. He urged all to do their part, by working from home, cutting back on social activitiesand staying home as much as possible during this period of tightened movement restrictions. SINGAPORE'S IMPROVEDCAPABILITIES But it is not the first time Singapore has had to deal with spikes in community cases, Mr Wong said, adding that the country’s capabilities have been significantly strengthened. “Our testing capacity is much larger – we tested about 35,000 swabs per day in the past week, and have the lab capacity to test up to 73,000 per day, or even more with pooled testing,” he said. TraceTogether and Safe Entry are also “more pervasive” now, meaning contact tracing can be done more quickly, he said. He added that vaccination has been “a major game-changer”. “We haven’t vaccinated everyone yet, but we have covered most of our older population as well as our healthcare and frontline workers at the air and sea ports and our stay-home noticehotels and dormitories. This puts us in a much safer position,” he said. Mr Wong also said that experience over the past year has shown that if the country acts swiftly to contain cases, test, and if all exercise individual and social responsibility, the spread of the virus can be suppressed. “We’ve brought down infection rates in the community before, and we can do it again this time,” he said. “THERE IS NO PLACE FOR DISCRIMINATION” Mr Wong also thanked frontline staff who have been fighting the virus for more than a year, saying the best way to support them was to take health measures seriously. This includes getting vaccinated when it is offered, he said. He also urged against spreading falsehoods or unverified information that creates “needless fear”, or fosters “suspicions” in society. “This is not a Chinese virus or an Indian variant. This is a global pandemic – the virus and its variants are out there everywhere in the world. “There is no place for discrimination, racism or xenophobia here,” he said. He added that Singapore has had its share of setbacks over the past year in its fight against COVID-19, but it has bounced back from them. Mr Wong said: “Let’s draw confidence from what we have been through; let’s brace ourselves for the rest of the marathon, complete the race together, and emerge stronger at the finish line.” Watch his full ministerial statement: Downloadourappor subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

No visitors will be allowed into the hospital except for critically ill patients. \"Elective cases will be deferred except for those that are urgent, and A&E cases that are non-life-threatening will be redirected to other hospitals,\" MOH added. UNLINKED COMMUNITY CASE The remaining community case, whichis unlinked, is a 39-year-old Vietnamese woman who works as a cleaner. She is employed by Octo Jet Building Maintenance Services and was deployed at a community care facility at Tuas South. Listed as case 62553, MOH said she wears full personal protection equipment (PPE), including N95 mask, face shield, gown and gloves at work. \"She also periodically helps out at a food stall at The Summit located at the National University of Singapore’s Bukit Timah campus,\" said the ministry. She is asymptomatic and was detected when she was swabbed on Apr 26 as part of rostered routine testing. Her pooled test result came back positive for COVID-19 the next day, and she was taken to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases. An individual test was done on Apr 27 and her test result came back positive for COVID-19 infection. Her earlier tests from rostered routine tests – the last being on Apr 14 – were all negative for COVID-19 infection. \"Her serology test result has come back positive but we have assessed that this is likely a recent infection,\" said MOH. She received her first dose of COVID-19 vaccine on Jan 27 and the second dose on Feb 19. \"The COVID-19 vaccine is effective in preventing symptomatic disease for the vast majority of those vaccinated, but it is possible for vaccinated individuals to get infected,\" MOH added. Overall, the number of new cases in the community has increased from 10 in the week before to 28 in the past week. Unlinked cases in the community have also increased from five cases in the week before to seven cases in the past week. \"We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance programme,\" said MOH. 19 IMPORTED CASES Nineteen of the new cases were imported and were placed on stay-home notice upon arrival in Singapore. They includetwo Singaporeans and nine permanent residents who returned from India and South Korea. Threeare dependant\\'s pass holders who arrived from India and Sri Lanka. The remaining five imported infections involve work permit holders who arrived from Bangladesh, India, Indonesia and the Philippines. One of them, who arrived from the Philippines, is a foreign domestic worker. Twentymorecases have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities, taking the total recoveries to 60,738, said MOH. A total of 110 cases are still in hospital, most of whom are stable or improving, with none in the intensive care unit. Another 243 cases are isolated and cared for at community facilities. They have mild symptoms, or are clinically well but still test positive for COVID-19. As of Thursday, Singapore has reported a total of 61,121 COVID-19cases.

SINGAPORE: Stakeholders in Singapore’s construction industry on Monday (May 17) appealed to the COVID-19 multi-ministry task force to allow foreign workers to enter Singapore “in a safe and controlled manner”. The Construction Industry Joint Committee (CIJC) said that the current manpower situation may result in further delays to construction projects and could cause jobs to be lost in the industry, and has asked the Government “to adopt a balanced approach and work with industry to allow the recruitment and inflow of foreign manpower”. “With the Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) issued on May 14, the built environment industry understands and supports the Government’s efforts to curb a resurgence of COVID-19 cases amidst the emergence of new virus variants in Singapore,” CIJC said in a media release. “However, we have serious concerns about the acute manpower situation for the construction industry.” Singapore has suspended entry for long-term pass holders and short-term visitors with recent travel history to India since Apr 24. This includes those who transit in India. Those with recent travel history to Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka have also been barred from entering or transiting in Singapore since May 2. CIJC said that the shortage of manpower is leading to issues with workplace safety. “The complexity and nature of construction work necessitates the deployment of workers from various trades, and the current reduced workforce is already working at maximum capacity, increasing the risks of workplace incidents,” it said. “We are suffering from reduced productivity due to safe management measures at the worksites and many of our migrant workers plan to return home when their work permits expire.” CIJC said that existing delays to the construction of Housing and Development Board flats and private homes could be exacerbated by the closure of borders, while public infrastructure projects and maintenance works could also be affected. Jobs in the industry could also be lost as a result, the committee said. “The built environment sector consists of over 18,000 firms and hires tens of thousands of Singaporeans. These jobs are at stake, if there are further impacts to the sector,” CIJC said. “The reality is that the industry needs sufficient inflow of migrant workers, both returning and new ones to take over the place of those who have left Singapore for various reasons, in order to sustain the industry and ensure that we can deliver on our projects.” CIJC has offered to work with the Government to find a solution. “We are prepared to work with the relevant agencies and stakeholders to establish a viable end-to-end system to bring in migrant workers in a safe and controlled manner so as to enable work to continue, while keeping Singaporeans safe,” it said. The industry also hopes that the Government will consider additional relief measures for the built environment sector, CIJC added. The key stakeholders in CIJC are the Association of Consulting Engineers Singapore, the Institution of Engineers Singapore, the Real Estate Developers’ Association of Singapore, the Singapore Contractors Association Limited, the Singapore Green Building Council, the Singapore Institute of Architects, the Singapore Institute of Building Limited, the Singapore Institute of Surveyors and Valuers, and the Society of Project Managers Singapore.

A COVID-19 update on the site said: \"Although the University has decided not to officially suspend exchange for AY2021/22 Semester 1 (Fall 2021), exchange students should be aware of the possible hurdles and additional expenses associated with an exchange for the upcoming term. \"The following section details the many steps required to continue with an exchange, to ensure students can make the best decision based on their own risk tolerance, academic requirements and financial situations.\" However, the exchange programmes for outgoing students from NUS to other countries had been suspended. The latest update on the site, dated May 18 said: \"The COVID-19 situation still remains very fluid, with epicentres of the pandemic shifting around the world, and new variants of the virus emerging with ever-greater frequency. \"Despite vaccinations being rolled out to varying degrees of success in many countries, it appears the road to pre-pandemic levels of international travel will be much longer than expected.\" An NUS spokesperson said on Friday that with the exception of a handful of countries such as those with which Singapore has set up unilateral border openings, NUS will suspend applications from inbound exchange students in light of the Immigrations and Checkpoints Authority’s tightened border control measures. \"Students entering Singapore will have to comply with the prevailing Stay Home Notice regime,\" the spokesperson added. \"For alternatives to in-person overseas exchange programmes, there is a suite of online summer programmes offered by NUS’ partner universities, e-STEERs (Study Trips for Engagement and Enrichment) and virtual joint immersion programmes that NUS students can participate in.\" Downloadourappor subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

The closure orders will take effect when dining-in is allowed to resume after Jun 13, MSE said in a press release. Singapore last week announced tighter COVID-19 measures underPhase 2 (Heightened Alert)after a spike in COVID-19 community cases. The measures, which came intoeffect on May 16 and will last until Jun 13, include reducing the size of group gatherings to two and suspending dining-in at food and beverage outlets. HooHa Restaurant and Café at Viva Vista had allowed customers to consume alcohol after 10.30pm and provided card games and music entertainment on May 14. As this is the restaurant’s third offence, it was ordered by the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) to close for 30 days. Darts Legend at Alice @ Mediapolis was also ordered to close for 20 days after it allowed darts to be played on a dart machine on the same day. This is the establishment’s second offence. Additionally, two food and beverage outlets at Ngee Ann City – Food Village and The Sushi Bar Dining – were fined S$1,000 each for breaching safe management measures such as maintaining safe distancing between patrons. Authorities also fined nine individuals for gathering in groups of more than two people in parks and beaches managed by NParks on May 16. MSE added that all water play areas and water recreational facilities in NParks-managed parks and gardens will continue to be closed until Jun 13, in line with stricter safe management measures. “NParks will temporarily close access to some parks, and sections of beaches, lawns, and facilities, such as shelters and car parks, when these areas get too crowded, to ensure that safe distancing can be observed,” the ministry said. “These areas will be reopened when they are less crowded.” Downloadourappor subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

       " {'text': 'covid 19 virus variants india singapore what you need know 14746598 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: As of May 3, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has found 29 COVID-19 local cases thatwere infected with variants of concern or interest. These 29 local cases have viral variants that were first detected in the United Kingdom, South Africa, Brazil or India. On Tuesday (May 4), MOH director of medical services Kenneth Mak said thatseven cases in threelocal clusters have one of the variants first detected inIndia - the B16172. Thisincludes the Tan Tock Seng Hospital cluster whichhad40 cases as of Tuesday. Education Minister Lawrence Wong, who co-chairs the COVID-19 task force, said that while there were unlinked cases of COVID-19 before, these did not develop into clusters. \"The new variant strains have higher attack rates, they are more infectious, they are causing larger clusters than before,\" he said.\"Due to the new variants, (the cases) are more infectious and larger clusters are forming.\" Here\\'s what we know so far about the new variants: VARIANTS DETECTED IN SINGAPORE Mr Wong noted at the task force press conference on Tuesday thatthe global COVID-19 situation had worsened, with new variants and cases spreading from South Asia to Southeast Asia. MOH has listed the COVID-19variants detected in local or imported coronavirus cases in Singapore, and sixdifferent strains were also found among local cases. Ten local cases have one of two sub-variants from India. Seven have been infected with theB16172 variant, while three were found with the B16171 variant. Eight localcases have the B1351 variant that was first found in South Africa. The B117 or UK variant, which had been flagged earlier, was detected in seven cases and there were three cases of the P1 Brazilian strain of SARS-CoV-2. LOCAL CLUSTERS WITH VARIANTS A number of COVID-19 clusters that have formed in Singapore are tied to the coronavirus variants. \"Of note, seven cases in three of our local clusters have the B16172 or Indian variant,\" said Assoc ProfMak on Tuesday. Five of these cases are part of the cluster at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, one case isthe immigration officer deployed at Changi Airport Terminal One and a case in the third cluster is a cleaner at acommunity care facilityat Tuas South. Professor Mak added that these viruses had been found to be \"phylogenetically distinct\", suggesting thatthe clusters were not linked. \"We have not completed the phylogenetic testing of all cases that we have and we\\'re likely to see more viral variants identified over time,\" he said. He added that the presence of these viral variants of concernaffirmed Singapore\\'s strategy to vaccinate all healthcare workers and prioritise vaccination for older Singaporeans. \"Had we not done so, the Tan Tock Seng cluster would have been significantly larger at this time,\" he said. \"And the likelihood of that cluster getting out of control that much greater.\" WHAT IS THE B1617 VARIANT? The COVID-19 virus is constantly mutating, but the the World Health Organization (WHO) has a \"watchlist\" of the variants that pose a risk to public health. The viral variantB1617, which was first seen in India,has been classified as one of seven \"variantsof interest\" by WHO.These are variants that are being monitored as they show mutations that have epidemiological implications, such as thetransmissibility orseverity of the disease. Assistant Professor October Sessions from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Healthsaid that as the virus spreads, the likelihood of new variants appearing increasesand these will co-circulate until one gains a fitness advantage over the others. \"The majority of these variants will be neutral - they will not change the behaviour of the virus,\" he said. Variants of concern, as opposed to variants of interest, must have an impact on diagnostics, treatments or vaccines, be more contagious or cause more severe disease. The UK, South African and Brazilian variants have been listed as variants of concern by WHO. \"Though this work is in progress, these criteria have not been characterised for the majority of variants that are rapidly evolving in India.\" Scientists are still studying whether the variant is driving an unexpected explosion in cases in India. WHO said in its Apr 27 update that preliminary modelling suggests it has \"a higher growth rate than other circulating variants in India, suggesting potential increased transmissibility\". \"It is often hard to tease out whether increased spread is due to relaxation of societal measures, decreased compliance or the virus itself,\" saidProfessor of Medicine at NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine Dale Fisher. \"I think most of us believe that all these variants of concern are more transmissible because they have quite quickly become dominant and there are shared mutations.\" KEY MUTATIONS IN THE B1617 VARIANT There arethree sub-strains of the B1617 variant - B16171,B16172 andB16173, and they share some characteristic mutations. The varianthas been called the \"Bengal strain\" as it was first detected in that region in India. It has also been called atriple mutant -although the variant contains a total of 13 spike protein mutations, there arethree which are of concern. All three mutations have been detected inother globally circulating variants and experts say they have evolved independently as the virus adapts to better infect humans. One of the mutations, E484Q, which isvery similar to the E484K mutation found in the South African and Brazilian variants, has been called the \"escape mutation\". This is because it appears to partially \"escape\"immunity from prior infection or vaccines. Another mutation, L452R, was associated with large outbreaksin California and is estimated to be 20 per cent more transmissible than earlier waves of the virus.A third mutation, P681R, is also thought to make the virusmore infectious. Professor Fisher said that the variants have an increased capacity to bind: \"It is like a lock and a key where the virus spike protein is the key and the receptors on the host cell are the lock.The mutations have a better key shape so it takes less virus to cause disease.\" Thismeans that precautions such assafe distancing, masks and hand hygiene have to be \"done very well\", he said. \"The measures still work but the new viruses are better at infecting so (they) will take advantage of small breaches that you may have gotten away with when the virus was the earlier strains.\" Asst Prof Sessions added there have now been many documented cases of people shedding the virus beyond the 14-day mark. \"In response to this and the increased presence of more highly transmissible strains currently circulating in nearby countries, the stay-home notice has now been increased to 21 days to prevent the escape of the viruses into the community,\" he said.

Two of the seven cases are linked to thecluster involving workers atPasir Panjang Terminal and had already been placedon quarantine. The other five cases are currently unlinked, including three people who work at Changi Airport, said theMinistry of Health (MOH). The remaining 13 cases are imported and were placed on stay-home notice or isolated upon arrival in Singapore, said the ministry. CLUSTER INVOLVING PASIR PANJANG TERMINAL WORKERS The two cases linked to the cluster are a 27-year-old car groomer and a 54-year-old car mechanic. Both cases are family and household contacts of three previous cases, including Case 62824 - a Singaporean trailer truck driver at Brani Terminal and Pasir Panjang Terminal who tested positive on May 4. The 27-year-old car groomer, a work permit holder, works at BlackNano at Bukit Batok but does not typically interact with customers, said MOH. The 54-year-old car mechanic, a permanent resident, works at Jag Technical Services at New Upper Changi Road. \"His work entails occasionally going to Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) camps for servicing and repair of vehicles but he did not interact with any SAF personnel,\" said MOH. He is fully vaccinated against COVID-19, having received his first dose on Mar 6 and the second on Mar 27. Both of the new cases wereasymptomatic. They were swabbed on May 6 during quarantine and theirtest results came back positive the next day. CHANGI AIRPORT WORKERS Of the three cases who work at Changi Airport, one is a47-year-oldcleaner deployed at Terminal 3.The work permit holder was fully vaccinated against COVID-19. He is asymptomatic and was detected when he was swabbed on May 5 as part of rostered routine testing. His pooled test result came back positiveon the same day. An individual test was done on May 6 and the positive result was confirmed on May 7. His serology test result has come back positive, but MOH said it has assessed that this is likely a recent infection. Another case involves a 33-year-old Singaporean who is asafety coordinator employed by Shimizu Corporation and deployed atTerminal 3. His work does not entail interaction with passengers, said MOH. He was swabbed as part of routine testing on May 4 and developed a fever after workon May 5. He sought medical treatment at a clinic the next day, where he was tested for COVID-19. The test result came back positive on May 7. His serology test result is negative. The third case is a 57-year-old Singaporean who is an aviation officer at Terminal 1 and 3. His work involves screening departing and transiting passengers. He was swabbed as part of routine testing on May 5. He developed a sore throat in the evening but did not seek medical treatment. \"He went to work the next day, and his sore throat worsened,\" said MOH. On May 7, hispooled test result came back positive for COVID-19, and so did hisindividual test result. His serology test is pending. \"Given the recent cases who work at Changi Airport, as a precautionary measure MOH will commence special testing operations for all staff working at Changi Airport Terminal 1 and Terminal 3, and Jewel,\" said the ministry on Saturday. OTHER UNLINKED CASES Another unlinked community case involvesa 40-year-old Singaporeanwho is employed by Batamindo Shipping andWarehousing. He wasdeployed as an operations assistant at Keppel Distripark andhad not been at Pasir Panjang Terminal. He also works part-time as a GrabFood delivery personnel. He is asymptomatic and was detected when he was swabbed onMay 4 as part of rostered routine testing. His pooled test result came back positive for COVID-19 the next day. He was taken to NCIDon May 6 where an individual swabwas done. The test result was positive. His earlier tests from rostered routine testing– the last being on Mar14– were all negative for COVID-19 infection. His serology test result has come back positive, but MOH said this is likely a recent infection. The final community case is an 18-year-old Singaporean who is a student at Victoria Junior College. Shedeveloped flu-like symptoms after school on May 5 and had a fever the next day. She sought medical treatment at a general practitioner clinic on May 6, where she was tested for COVID-19. Her test result came back positive the next day. Her serological test result is pending. IMPORTED CASES Of the 13 imported cases, sixare Singaporeans and threeare Singapore permanent residents whoreturned from Canada, India and Indonesia. One is a dependant\\'s pass holder who arrived from Canada. Two are work permit holderswho arrived from Bangladesh and Indonesia, of whom one is a foreign domestic worker.

       " {'text': 'japan osaka covid 19 wave hospital icu medical system collapse 14874362 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners OSAKA, Japan: Hospitals in Japan\\'s second largest city of Osaka are buckling under a huge wave of new COVID-19 infections, running out of beds and ventilators as exhausted doctors warn of a \"system collapse\", and advise against holding the Olympics this summer. Japan\\'s western region home to 9 million people is suffering the brunt of the fourth wave of the pandemic, accounting for a third of the nation\\'s death toll in May, although it constitutes just 7 per cent of its population. The speed at which Osaka\\'s healthcare system was overwhelmed underscores the challenges of hosting a major global sports event in two months\\' time, particularly as only about half of Japan\\'s medical staff have completed inoculations. \"Simply put, this is a collapse of the medical system,\" said Yuji Tohda, the director of Kindai University Hospital in Osaka. \"The highly infectious British variant and slipping alertness have led to this explosive growth in the number of patients.\" Japan has avoided the large infections suffered by other nations, but the fourth pandemic wave took Osaka prefecture by storm, with 3,849 new positive tests in the week to Thursday. That represents a more than five-fold jump over the corresponding period three months ago. Just 14 per cent of the prefecture\\'s 13,770 COVID-19 patients have been hospitalised, leaving the majority to fend for themselves. Tokyo\\'s latest hospitalisation rate, in comparison, is 37 per cent. A government advisory panel sees rates of less than 25 per cent as a trigger to consider imposition of a state of emergency. By Thursday, 96 per cent of the 348 hospital beds Osaka reserves for serious virus cases were in use. Since March, 17 people have died from the disease outside the prefecture\\'s hospitals, officials said this month. The variant can make even young people very sick quickly, and once seriously ill, patients find it tough to make a recovery, said Toshiaki Minami, director of the Osaka Medical and Pharmaceutical University Hospital (OMPUH). \"I believe that until now many young people thought they were invincible. But that can\\'t be the case this time around. Everyone is equally bearing the risk.\" BREAKING POINT Minami said a supplier recently told him that stocks of propofol, a key drug used to sedate intubated patients, are running very low, while Tohda\\'s hospital is running short of the ventilators vital for severely ill COVID-19 patients. Caring for critically ill patients in the face of infection risk has taken a serious toll on staff, said Satsuki Nakayama, the head of the nursing department at OMPUH. \"I\\'ve got some intensive care unitstaff saying they have reached a breaking point,\" she added. \"I need to think of personnel change to bring in people from other hospital wings.\" About 500 doctors and 950 nurses work at OMPUH, which manages 832 beds. Ten of its 16 ICU beds have been dedicated to virus patients. Twenty of the roughly 140 serious patients taken in by the hospital died in the ICU. Yasunori Komatsu, who heads a union of regional government employees, said conditions were dire as well for public health nurses at local health centres, who liaison between patients and medical institutions. \"Some of them are racking up 100, 150, 200 hours of overtime, and that has been going on for a year now ... when on duty, they sometimes go home at 1am or 2amin the morning, and go to bed only to be awakened by a phone call at 3am or 4am.\" Medical professionals with firsthand experience of Osaka\\'s struggle with the pandemic take a negative view on holding the Tokyo Games, set to run from Jul23 to Aug 8. \"The Olympics should be stopped, because we already have failed to stop the flow of new variants from England, and next might be an inflow of Indian variants,\" said Akira Takasu, the head of emergency medicine at OMPUH. He was referring to a variant first found in India that the World Health Organization (WHO) designated as being of concern after initial studies showed it spread more easily. \"In the Olympics, 70,000 or 80,000 athletes and the people will come to this country from around the world. This may be a trigger for another disaster in the summer.\" Downloadourappor subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

       " {'text': 'covid 19 home based learning primary secondary school jc 14821222 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners Pre-schools and student care centres will remain open, while tuition centres should move activities online. SINGAPORE: All primary andsecondary schools, as well as junior colleges and Millennia Institute, will shift to full home-based learning from Wednesday (May 19) until the end of the term on May 28, amid a rise in COVID-19 cases in Singapore. This also applies to students from special education schools. Announcing the decisionon Sunday, Minister for Education Chan Chun Sing said authorities understand that the shift to full home-based learning \"may cause anxiety in some parents\". \"But we want to assure all parents and students that MOE (Ministry of Education) will continue to extend our help and our fullest support to the schools, the teachers and the parents who require additional help to make these adjustments,\" he said. “And we also want to put in place measures to continue to minimise the disruptions to the learning of our students.” The decision comes afterseveral primary school students tested positive for COVID-19 in recent days, with most of the infections linked to tuition centres. At a media conference by the COVID-19 multi-ministry task force, Mr Chan noted that some of the new mutations of the coronavirus are “much more virulent” and “seem to attack the younger children”. The B1617 strain appears to affect children more, said Minister for Health Ong Ye Kung, citingthe ministry’s director of medical services Kenneth Mak. \"So you will notice that for schools, the response has been different compared to say last year,” he added. During the June holidays, schools will allow graduating cohorts to return in small groups where necessary, and the mid-year GCE O- and A-Level Mother Tongue language examinations will proceed as planned with strict measures in place, said MOEin a separate press release. PRE-SCHOOLS WILL REMAIN OPEN Pre-schools and student care centres will remain open to support families who need these services, said Mr Chan, although he encouragedparents to keep their children at home where possible since work-from-home is now the default arrangement. Institutes of higher learning will reduce attendance on campus by converting more classes online where possible, except for essential in-person sessions like labs, practicals and final-year projects, said Mr Chan. All centre-based tuition and enrichment classes should move activities online until the end of Phase 2 (Heightened Alert), he added. “This is necessary to reduce the intermingling of students from different schools and enhance the safety of our students,” said MOE in its media release. These measures will last until the end of Phase 2 (Heightened Alert). “Going forward, we must work on the assumption that now and then, there will be cases that will emerge in our community and perhaps in our schools. Thus far, we have no conclusive evidence of school-based transmission, we must never be complacent,” said Mr Chan. “Going forward we will need a range of options in order to thrive in a COVID world, for us to continue learning and living in a COVID world.” Mr Chan also responded to a question about the transmission of the virus between several students who had shared a school bus, as reported in the Ministry of Health\\'s daily update on Saturday. “What is of course of concern to us is not just what is happening within the classroom in the school setting. What is of course of concern to us will be the outside school activities and interactions including … the school bus,” said Mr Chan. Adding that this is why tuition and enrichment centres have been asked to move activities online, he said: “Because we have tried our very best to make sure that we keep the cohorts within each of the school tight. And that is how we have been relatively successful in preventing transmissions within the schools.” Downloadourappor subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

       " {'text': 'covid 19 dining rest space food delivery riders restrictions 14848472 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: When dining-in restrictions were announced recently, the owners of a logistics firm thought about one group of people who will be affected - food delivery riders. Mr Muhammad Adha and Mr Muhammad Ikhbar, co-owners of Bao Logistics, realised thatriders will need a space to sit during their breaks. \"We know how it feels like to deliver orders everyday under the hot sun ...all kinds of weather,\" Mr Adha said. Beyond just eating, dining-in at food and beverage outlets previously would mean thatriders couldrelax and enjoy the environment, he said. As part of Phase 2 (Heightened Alert), dining-in at F&B establishments was suspended on May 16 through Jun 13. This includes hawker centres and food courts, both indoors and outdoors. So Mr Adha and Mr Ikhbardecided to make availablean unused air-conditioned space within their premises in an Yishun industrial buildingso that food delivery riders could have a place to rest and eat at. They moved into the building three weeks ago. \"We had an empty space, so why not?\" Mr Adha said. To prepare for it, they used tape to demarcate \"parking lots\" for motorcycles and electric bicyclesoutside their unit on the seventh floor of the building. The firmthen posted an announcement on their company\\'s Facebook pagewelcomingdelivery riders to rest and eat their meals at the spacefrom 12pm to 10pm everyday. HAVING A SPACE TO GO TO When CNA visited the premises on Thursday (May 20) at about 4pm, three riders were seenmaking themselves comfortable in the room, observing a safe distance from one another, and all of them had their masks on. The riders, who are friends, told CNA that they saw the Facebook post and decided to take their break there. Among them was Mr Feddly Shah, 37,who has been a rider for more than a year. \"We are so touched that they thought about us,\" he said. Before the new rules kicked in, they would usually take their breaks at coffee shops. With the dining-in restrictions, the riders, who mostly do their deliveries around the Yishun area have resortedto sitting at roadsides or outside convenience stores to have their meals. They had also been going into air-conditioned shopping malls to cool off a bit, but the communal seats there are not always available, the riderssaid. \"Sometimes we sit in the toilet to rest,\" Mr Feddly added. The riders said that they sometimes have had to wait for one to two hours for food orders to be ready.While waiting, they would previously be able to sit inside the outlets to take a shortrest, something they are not able to do now. Mr Muhammad Hamizan, 31, who first saw the post by Bao Logistics and shared it with his other two friends, said the new space is \"good for riders, rather than sitting outside malls\". Members of Parliament (MPs) also took to Facebook to post information on spaces within their wards that delivery riders, taxi drivers and private hiredrivers are free to use. MP Baey Yam Keng (PAP-Tampines)said that an area atthevoid deck ofBlock 475 at Tampines N4 neighbourhood centre has been set aside for them to have their meals. MP Tan Chuan Jin (PAP-Marine Parade) wrote on his Facebook: \"We have arranged for our sports/function halls in our Kampong Kembangan Community Club and Kampong Ubi Community Club for our food delivery riders and Safe Distancing Ambassadors to have a space to take meal breaks.\" Taxi and private hire vehicle drivers are welcome as well, he added. His fellow MP Seah Kian Peng (PAP-Marine Parade) also said on his Facebook page that he has made similar arrangements at Braddell Heights community club. \"A proper place to eat and and have a short break is important,\" he said.

       " {'text': 'china offer vaccines to taiwan covid 19 14877376 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners BEIJING: China on Monday (May 24) offered to urgently send COVID-19 vaccines to Taiwan to help it battle a sharp rise in coronavirus infections, drawing an angry response from Taipei and a swipe from Washington, which said US vaccines did not have strings attached. China and Chinese-claimed Taiwan have sparred repeatedly during the pandemic. Taipei has accused Beijing of spreading fake news and trying to limit its access to the World Health Organization (WHO), while Beijing says Taipei is trying to politicise the pandemic for political gain. After months of relative safety from the pandemic, Taiwan is dealing with a spike in COVID-19 cases and is rapidly running out of vaccines, having received only slightly more than 700,000 to date for its more than 23 million people. In a late night statement, China\\'s policy-making Taiwan Affairs Office said it was extremely concerned about the epidemic currently \"raging\" in Taiwan, noting it had repeatedly offered help to the island. Certain groups and people in Taiwan have been calling for the purchase of Chinese vaccines, it added. \"Our attitude is very clear: We are willing to make arrangements quickly so that the vast majority of Taiwan compatriots will have mainland vaccines to use as soon as possible,\" the office said. \"If necessary, we are also willing to actively consider sending epidemic prevention and control experts to Taiwan, to share anti-epidemic experience with Taiwan\\'s medical and health professionals.\" \"OBSTACLES\" But in response, Taiwan\\'s Mainland Affairs Council said China had not used any of the existing channels between the two to provide information about its vaccines, and implied that Beijing was behind Taiwan\\'s difficulties in getting more shots. \"Every time Taiwan\\'s internal epidemic heats up, it (China) criticises our government for obstructing the import of mainland vaccines,\" it said in a statement sent to Reuters. \"The other side knows what obstacles Taiwan is facing to obtain vaccines - everyone knows it. There\\'s no point in saying any more.\" Taiwan has repeatedly said it does not trust Chinese vaccines, and has been angered by what it says are Beijing\\'s efforts to obstruct its access to the WHO, including the body\\'s annual ministerial assembly that opened earlier on Monday. A senior US administration official told Reuters that the \"strong partnership on COVID-19\" between Washington and Taipei would continue, and reiterated that the United States would give away at least 80 million doses around the world by end of June, more than either China or Russia. \"Importantly, our shots don\\'t come with strings attached,\" the official said, without giving details on how many doses Taiwan might get. \"We\\'re sharing vaccines with the world, and leading the world in a global vaccine strategy because it\\'s the right thing to do,\" the official said. China, Russia and the United States have sought to further their countries\\' geopolitical clout through so-called vaccine diplomacy, though the Chinese government has repeatedly denied that it uses the shots to gain diplomatic advantage. China views Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen and her ruling Democratic Progressive Party as separatists bent on formally declaring the island\\'s independence. Tsai says China has no right to speak for Taiwan and has denounced it for increased military activities near the island over the past year, which have continued even as Taipei battles increased COVID-19 cases.

SINGAPORE: Singapore will not accept new entry applications forwork pass holders from higher-risk countries and regions with immediate effect, as COVID-19 cases continue to rise in several places around the world. The new restriction excludes workers needed for key strategic projects and infrastructural works, who will be allowed to enter, said the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) on Friday (May 7). Higher-risk countries and regions refer to all places except Australia, Brunei, mainland China, New Zealand, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau. Work pass holders from higher-risk places who earlier received approval to enter Singapore before Jul 5 will no longer be allowed to do so - except for migrant domestic workers and those in theconstruction, marine shipyard and process industry. “We will inform employers on when to re-apply for entry when the situation has stabilised and will prioritise them for entry approval then,” said MOM. ARRIVALS RESCHEDULED FOR SOME APPROVED WORKERS For migrant domestic workers, those who havealready obtained approval will be allowed to enter Singapore, with the exception of some with planned arrivals before Jun 7. They will be rescheduled to arrive in subsequent weeks, MOM said. Similarly, workers in the construction, marine shipyard and process industry who have obtained approval will be allowed to enter. However, a small group with planned arrivals in June will be rescheduled to arrive in subsequent weeks. “In this period of heightened alert, we are making changes to the entry of work pass holders who have earlier obtained approvals to arrive from higher-risk countries and regions from Tuesday, May 11 onwards,” MOM said. \"In view of the need to reschedule the entry of work pass holders who had already obtained approval to enter, we regret that we will not be accepting new entry applications from higher-risk countries/regions with immediate effect, except for workers needed for key strategic projects and infrastructural works who we will continue to allow entry.\" These changes will not affect work pass holders already given approval or are seeking the green light to enter Singapore from lower-risk countries and regions under the Periodic Commuting Arrangement (PCA) and the Reciprocal Green Lane (RGL), said MOM. The ministry also said it will be reaching out to affected work pass holders and their employers about the changes to their entry dates. “We seek the understanding and cooperation of work pass holders and their employers for these changes,” MOM said. “They are necessary to enable workers to enter in a safe and calibrated manner, and mitigate the risk of COVID-19 importation.” Singapore has been tightening COVID-19 border measures in recent days. On Apr 22, it announced that all long-term pass holders and short-term visitors with recent travel history to India will not be allowed entry from Apr 24due to theworsening COVID-19 situation there. On May 2, this was extended to include those with recent travel history to Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Due to the restrictions, companies that have traditionally relied on migrant workers from India and Bangladesh are faced with a shortage of workers and arelooking for alternative options. Companies saidproject delays and disruptions are expected for the time being, while the Building and Construction Authority has promised support measures such asgranting more flexibility for firms bringing in workers from China. Editor’s note: This story has been updated to reflect MOM’s correction of its initial press release: Only the PCA and RGL travel lanes are not affected; other approved travel lanes are affected.

       " {'text': 'government doing everything to prevent community spread pm 14723800 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: With the emergence of several new COVID-19 clusters in the community, the Government is doing everything it can to prevent them from spreading, said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Saturday (May 1). The new clusters are emerging after a long period of very few community cases, with some being “quite big and worrying”, Mr Lee noted in his May Day Rally speech. The Government will have to be agile and decisive in its response,tighten measures \"promptly\" when necessary to clamp down on the spread so as to avoid going into a second “circuit breaker”. Over the past week, Singapore has seen an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases in the community, including its first hospital cluster at the Tan Tock Seng Hospital. This cluster is also currently the country\\'s largest with 13 cases. Mr Lee urged Singaporeans to work with the Government and “not let down our guard”. “It is not time to relax yet. This is a marathon. Let’s keep jogging. Let’s keep ourselves safe,” he said. “Don\\'t make the mistake which other countries have done - celebrate too early, relax too fast, let your guard down (and) cause another wave to come. Very often worse than the first and more nasty drastic measures become necessary. “If we have to do another lockdown like last year’s circuit breaker, it would be a major setback for our people and for our economic recovery,” he added. “Let’s not make it happen.” Mr Lee noted that Singapore’s economic outlook has now “brightened considerably”, with the global recession being less protracted than initially feared. Given the external trends such as a strong recovery anticipated in the United States, there is “a very good chance” for the economy to see growth of “6 per cent or more this year\", he added. “EMERGENCY LEGISLATION” FOR CONSTRUCTION SECTOR Mr Lee said the efforts and sacrifices of many workers have been a reason why the country managed to keep the pandemic under control so far. For instance, healthcare workers have been on the frontline, testing, vaccinating and treating patients. Aviation workers, whose livelihoods were severely impacted, also joined the frontline by becoming patient care ambassadors, contact tracers and safe distancing ambassadors. Workers in the construction sector have also experienced COVID-19 at “ground zero”, said Mr Lee. While the outbreak in the migrant worker dormitories has been put out, said Mr Lee, safe management measures that remain necessary have burdened the industry. Coupled with a manpower crunch, these have led to projects being delayed and costs going up. In addition, the recent ban on travellers from India has worsened the situation for the industry. Singapore on Apr 24 stopped allowing entry to all long-term pass holders and short-term visitors with recent travel history to India within the last 14 days. As such, the Government is working on “emergency legislation to address this severe disruption and to share the burden more fairly between the different parties”, namely the contractors, developers and buyers. “We will introduce the legislation, I hope, in the next sitting of Parliament,” said Mr Lee. Mr Lee also noted that the pandemic has impacted workers from other sectors, which is why the Government has provided reliefs and grants to help businesses tide through the recession. But as the economy recovers, it will have to recalibrate support to a more sustainable level. Moving forward, Singapore must “find a way to fully recover” and “build new muscles” for life after the COVID-19 pandemic. On this, Mr Lee said trends are already under way and the country will have to seize these emerging opportunities, namely in the form of digitalisation, automation and sustainability. NEW NTUC FOUNDATION Earlier at the May Day Rally, National Trades Union Congress (NTUC)secretary-general Ng Chee Meng announced the set-up of a NTUC Foundation, which will have aninitial funding of S$250 million. These funds willbe invested to provide NTUC\\'sfinancial assistance schemes and grants with \"a steady income flow\", he said. Currently, NTUC supports its vulnerable members through its U Care initiatives in the form of financial assistance and grants, which are funded bydonors such as the Singapore Labour Foundation, NTUC Social Enterprises, affiliated unions, private sector corporations and individuals. But since the pandemic hit, some donors have faced difficulties in contributing while the needs of some of its members have increased, said Mr Ng. “With a steady source of income, we will have the flexibility to do more in co-creating opportunities and support to benefit, especially our lower-wage workers,\" he said. The new foundation, which was incorporated on Apr 27, will also better enable NTUC to diversify the type of support provided and respond to the changing needs of its members through economic ups and downs, said NTUC in a separate press release. Welcoming the new initiative by NTUC, Mr Lee said protecting vulnerable people in the society is also a key priority of the Government. He pointed to how the Government has been working with tripartite partners to extend the progressive wage model to more sectors, like food services and retail. “This is not just a theoretical exercise, but a practical effective strategy to improve the lives of more lower-wage workers, and we plan to more than double the number of workers covered under the progressive wage model over the next few years,” he said. Other plans to support lower-income workers arealso in the works and Mr Lee added that he intends to speak about them at the National Day Rally in a few months’ time. STRONG LABOUR MOVEMENT NEEDED In his speech, Mr Lee also paid tribute to the labour movement for their work over past crises, such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003, and during the COVID-19 pandemic where NTUC’s dedication to its mission “has truly come to the fore”. “You protect workers in every way when retrenchments are unavoidable, for example in the aviation industry or in banking. The unions ensured that retrenchments were carried out fairly and responsibly,” he said. Alongside other efforts to help affected workers and businesses, employment figures have since inched back up, while the unemployment rate has fallen after an initial increase, he added. “So today on May Day, I\\'d like to say a very big thank you to all our brothers and sisters for your tireless efforts over the past year, for your never-say-die spirit which has helped us come through COVID-19 together,” Mr Lee told 200 labour movement leaders and tripartite partners who attended the May Day Rally at Downtown East, as well as others who tuned in via an online livestream. Moving forward amid an uncertain world, Singapore must keep its labour movement strong while strengthening bonds with a pro-labour Government. Noting that the NTUC is celebrating its 60th anniversary this year, Mr Lee said: “On your 60th birthday,I not only wish you happy birthday but I ask you to remain steadfast in NTUC’s mission to strengthen your close partnership with the Government, and to improve the lives of Singapore workers. “Whatever storms come our way and we can be sure, this is not the last one, let\\'s make sure Singapore continues to grow and to prosper, united and strong for many years to come.” Downloadourappor subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

       " {'text': 'covid 19 vaccine moh vaccination virus pfizer moderna 14786464 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners A total of 1.2 million people have completed the full vaccination regimen, says Health Minister Gan Kim Yong. SINGAPORE: As of May 9, about 1.8 million people have received at least one dose of aCOVID-19 vaccine, with 1.2 million of them receiving their second dose,said Health Minister Gan Kim Yong in Parliament on Tuesday (May 11). In a ministerial statement on the whole-of-government response to COVID-19, Mr Gan noted that Singapore continues to make \"steady progress\" with its vaccination programme and that the take-up has been \"encouraging\". He pointed out that about two-thirds of eligible people aged 45 and above have received the COVID-19 vaccination or booked their vaccination appointments. \"However, we need to continue to encourage more to be vaccinated - especially among the seniors - as given their age, they are the most vulnerable. I urge all of us to encourage our elderly family members too,\" said Mr Gan,who is also co-chair of the multi-ministry task forceon COVID-19. \"We will be inviting subsequent age bands to receive vaccinations from the later part of May. However, as vaccine supplies continue to be limited, vaccinations will be progressively extended in smaller age-bands. We thank everyone for your patience. And if vaccine supplies arrive as scheduled, we will complete the vaccination programme by the end of this year.\" BENEFITS OUTWEIGHING RISKS Mr Gan also noted that the benefits of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines continue to outweigh the known risks and that there remains a need to encourage Singaporeans to be vaccinated. As of Monday, 30 local fully vaccinated cases tested positive for COVID-19, noted Mr Gan. There were another 24 imported cases that were already vaccinated. \"Most of our local cases of infected vaccinated individuals were asymptomatic. None had severe COVID-19 disease requiring more intensive care,\" said Mr Gan. \"This is consistent with the international experience and emerging evidence that vaccines are highly efficacious in protecting against severe COVID-19 disease and likely to reduce the risk of transmission.\" When it comes to re-infected cases, as of Monday, 26 cases have been assessed to be re-infections, revealed Mr Gan. \"We are still investigating whether these are due to general waning of immunity over time or the lack of cross-protection against specific variants of COVID-19 that the individual is naive to. We will provide an update when we know more,\" he said. Mr Gan also responded to questions from Members of Parliament on vaccinations forchildren below 16;those with mild allergic reactions; and the need for a third booster shot. He noted that the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines are currently only approved for use in peopleaged 16and 18 years old and above respectively. “Initial data provided by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna at the time of the pandemic special access route (PSAR) interim authorisation did not include data regarding their use in younger populations,” he said. “The Health Sciences Authority has been examining the supplemental data that have since been submitted for the Pfizer vaccine, to assess if the vaccine meets safety and efficacy requirements for authorisation under PSAR for use in adolescents aged 12 to 15 years. HSA will also do so for (the) Moderna vaccine when data is submitted to them. We will share more details when ready.” Mr Gan noted that those assessed by a doctor to be allergic to the first dose of COVID-19 vaccination are currently “contraindicated” from the vaccine and should not continue with the second dose. When it comes to booster shots, Mr Gan said data on the need for it is still emerging, from both international and local studies. He said: “We will share more when we know more. Meanwhile, get the first two shots first.” As of May 3, 104 applications for the vaccine injury financial assistance programme have been received, said Mr Gan. Thirty of them have been assessed to meet the qualifying criteria, he added. This includes 21 cases of hypersensitivity, or allergic reactions, four neurology-related cases, three cardiology-related cases, and one haematology and dermatology-related case each. All of these cases have since been discharged from hospital, and the remaining 29 applications are pending, said the Health Minister. TACKLING \\'FEARMONGERING\\' Mr Gan also responded to questions about whether Singapore will recognise overseas vaccinations that are not approved by HSA. Singapore is in discussion with several regions on mutual recognition of vaccination certificates for travel purposes, he said, reiterating Minister for Transport Ong Ye Kung. Details will be released when the arrangements are confirmed, Mr Gan added. Responding to questions about Sinovac and other vaccine candidates, Mr Gan said that Singapore had entered into advance purchase agreements with Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Sinovac last year, even before the clinical trials were completed. This was to “secure a diversified vaccine portfolio to improve our chances” of securing a suitable vaccine that is safe and effective for the population, he added. “This was how we managed to start our vaccination drive with Pfizer and Moderna vaccines early.” Singapore took the delivery of a shipment of the Sinovac vaccines based on the schedules that had been planned for and committed under the advance purchase agreement with the company, said Mr Gan. “HSA is currently carefully evaluating Sinovac and a few other vaccines for use in Singapore, and we will update the public when we have made progress,” he added Mr Gan noted that there has also been “vaccine misinformation”, and said that the Government aims tocurb its spread. Responding to a question from the Leader of Opposition Pritam Singh, who had asked how the Government will address this, Mr Gan said that public education remains a “cornerstone” of the vaccination programme. “Government agencies have been using multiple platforms including print and broadcast media, social media, direct messaging platforms, and Gov.sg to communicate essential information about the COVID-19, including its vaccines to all segments of society,” he added. He noted that when called for, the Government would not hesitate to use “legislative levers” such as POFMA Correction Directions to stop individuals from spreading misinformation and “fear-mongering”. Said Mr Gan: “All of us have a role to play in stemming the spread of misinformation. Once again, I urge everyone to check that the information they receive comes from reliable sources and to make the effort to verify before sharing them.” Watch Mr Gan\\'s full ministerial statement: Additional reporting by Ang Hwee Min.

The cases involve a cleaner deployed to Changi Airport Terminal 3 and a full-time national serviceman (NSF), said the Ministry of Health (MOH). It is the second consecutive day no new COVID-19 cases have been linked to Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore\\'s largest active cluster. One of the new community cases is an 88-year-old Singaporean who is employed byRamky Cleantech Services as a cleaner and deployed at Changi Airport Terminal 3. He had not gone to work after the onset of symptoms, said the Health Ministry. The man, known as Case 62873, developed a runny nose and cough on May 4 and sought medical treatment at a general practitioner clinic, where he was tested for COVID-19. His test result came back positive the next dayand he was taken to Sengkang General Hospital in an ambulance. His earlier tests from rostered routine testing -the last being onApr 16- were all negative for COVID-19 infection. His serological test result is pending. The man received his first dose of COVID-19 vaccine on Jan 22 and the second dose on Feb 15. His case is currently unlinked. CLUSTER LINKED TO LASHING SPECIALISTGROWS The othercommunity case reported on Thursday is a 22-year-old permanent resident who is an NSF. Known as Case 62877, he is a household contact of Case 62824,aSingaporean whoworks as a trailer truck driver at Brani Terminal and Pasir Panjang Terminal. As he had been identified as a close contact of Case 62824,the manwas placed on quarantine on May 4and immediately isolated while in Sembawang Camp. He was tested for COVID-19 on May 5 even though he was asymptomatic. His test result came back positive the next day and he was taken in an ambulance to Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. His serology test result is negative. Case 62877 has been added to the cluster linked to Case 61822,a 23-year-old Indian national who works as a lashing specialist at Pasir Panjang Terminal. The cluster now has a total of five infections. The Ministry of Defence said the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) has been in touch with the NSFand his family to \"render support and assistance\". \"As part of precautionary measures in place for positive cases detected, the SAF has carried out immediate and thorough disinfection of the premises the serviceman had been in. All personnel who had been identified as close contacts have also been swab tested and are under quarantine,\" the Defence Ministry added. IMPORTED CASES The remaining 16caseswere imported and were placed on stay-home notice upon arrival in Singapore. They include seven permanent residents who returned from India, as well as a dependant\\'s pass holder who arrived from Nepal. Also among the imported cases weresix work permit holders who arrived from Bangladesh and Indonesia, of whom four are foreign domestic workers. The remaining two imported cases are a work pass holder who arrived from Malaysia, as well as a student\\'s pass holder who arrived from India and who had earlier been emplaced on his course. \"The arrivals from the Indian sub-continent had already come into Singapore before the restrictions on travel were imposed,\" said MOH. Since 11.59pm on Apr 23,all long-term pass holders and short-term visitors with recent travel history, including transit, to India within the past 14 days were not be allowed entry into or to transit through Singapore. These border measures were also applied from 11.59pm on May 1 to all long-term pass holders and short-term visitorswith recent travel history, including transit, to Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. No new infections were reported in migrant workers\\'dormitories. INCREASE IN OVERALL NUMBER OF COMMUNITY CASES MOH said the overall number of new cases in the community has increased from 28 cases in the week before to 48 cases in the past week.

NEW COVID-19CLUSTER REPORTED AT PASIR PANJANG TERMINAL PSA Singapore Port workers will be tested for COVID-19 infection after a new cluster was reported at Pasir Panjang Terminal on Wednesday. MOH said it will conduct\"special testing operations\" as a precautionary measure,after a trailer truck driver at Brani Terminal and Pasir Panjang Terminal tested positive for COVID-19 on Tuesday. The 59-year-old Singaporean man is employed by GKE Express Logistics and was last at work on May 1.

       " {'text': 'singapore shares tumble two month low tighter covid measures sti 14809924 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: Singapore shares tumbled to a more than two-month low on Friday (May 14), with aviation-related counters among the worst hit, as investors reacted to a further tightening in the country’s COVID-19 restrictions. To curb the rising number ofcommunity infections, dining-in will once again be prohibited and a new limit of two people for all social gatherings will kick in from Sundayfor four weeks.Among other measures, the COVID-19 multi-ministrytask force also announced a return to working from home as the default. The benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) fellmore than 3 per cent following the announcement just after 1pm, before clawing back some losses to close down 2.2 per cent or 68.24 points at 3,055.02. This marked the STI’s lowest level since Mar 8. For the day, losers outnumbered gainers by 467 to 127 with 3.52 billion units worth S$3.22 billion changing hands. “The market is not prepared for this drastic tightening of COVID-19 measures, which is happening so quickly after the earlier reduction,” said DailyFX’s strategist Margaret Yang, referring to how the group limit for social gatherings was cut from eight to five peopleslightly more than a week ago. “It reflects that the situation may be worse than we anticipated,” she added. “On the economic level, there will also definitely be some adverse impact on the services and travel sectors.” IG’s market strategist Yeap Jun Rong said the local equity market, which has chalked up a strong run since the start of the year, was pricing in a strong economic recovery on the back of a relatively controlled pandemic in Singapore. “The recent resurgences seem to cast doubt on the pace of economic recovery ahead, leading to near-term weakness in the STI, considering that a significant proportion of its constituents are in cyclicals,” he told CNA. Acyclicalstock is one whose underlying business generally follows the economic cycle. Aviation counters were among those badly hit. National carrier Singapore Airlines (SIA) fell 5.7 per cent to an 11-week low of S$4.50, while flight caterer SATS dropped 3.9 per cent to S$3.69. In addition to the heightened restrictions, the air travel bubble between Singapore and Hong Kong that was due to start on May 26 may be in for another delay. Transport Minister Ong Ye Kungsaid on Friday it is “very likely” that Singapore will not be able to meet the criteria for the travel bubble to go ahead. “Investors had been hoping for the roll-out of the vaccine to spur an economic recovery and a broader border reopening, but we are now moving backwards and it might take longer than we thought for the aviation industry to recovery,” said Ms Yang. Integrated resort operator Genting Singapore declined3.1 per cent to S$0.79. Banking heavyweights were also in the red – OCBC and UOB lost more than 2 per cent each, while DBS dropped 0.7 per cent. On the other hand, shares of supermarket chain Sheng Siong surged nearly 11 per cent to S$1.66. Describing this aso a knee jerk reaction to the ban on dine-ins, Ms Yang said: “If you look around, there are not a lot of safe-haven stcks left. Most of the sectors are badly hurt and supermarkets are the only ones benefiting from this return to stricter measures.” Among other heavily-traded stocks, Singtel fell 3.7 per cent to S$2.32 after warning that it expects to record net exceptional losses ofS$1.21 billionin its full-year results, mostly due to the impairment of assets and goodwill attwo businesses. MORE DOWNSIDE TO COME? Moving forward, the number of unlinked community cases will likely play a part in determining how the stock market moves over the next two weeks, said CMC Markets analyst Kelvin Wong. “If the number of unlinked community cases continues to be on the rise in the next two weeks, it implies that more stringent measures are likely to be implemented such as a ‘circuit breaker 2.0’,” he said. “Thus, stocks that are geared towards hospitality and travel, such as Genting, SIA, CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust may see further declines.” Mr Yeap also expects stocks related to the retail, hospitality and entertainment sectors to come under further pressure, given uncertainties about how the COVID-19 situation will evolve. Investors may opt for a “risk-off approach” in the near term, he said, considering that the STI has had a strong run since the start of the year and “may be due for some profit-taking” given the current uncertainties. “That said, the overall downside impact may be limited considering that prompt action was taken to limit the virus spread and more than 20 per cent of Singapore’s population has been fully vaccinated,” said the market analyst from IG.

       " {'text': \"biontech singapore vaccine manufacturing facility covid 14780802 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: The decision by German biotechnology firm BioNTechto chooseSingapore as the site for its regional headquarters and a new mRNA manufacturing facilityis a boostto the local biopharmaceutical ecosystem,Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing said on Monday (May 10). Noting that the messenger RNA (mRNA) technology has “drastically reduced” the time needed for vaccines to be produced, the new facility will also strengthen the portfolio of different vaccine production technologies in Singapore, he said at an online press conference after the announcement was made earlier in the day. “There will be new viruses that will emerge in time to come and what we need is a strong R&D (research and development) partnership to make sure that we continuously evolve our products in a timely fashion to serve our local and regional markets.” The new mRNA technology, which is used by the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, contains instructions for the human cells to make proteins that mimic part of the novel coronavirus and spur the immune system into action. BioNTech, in its press release, said it plans to open the Singapore office and begin construction of the new facility this year, subject to approval. The facility, which will produce a range of novel mRNA vaccines and therapeutics for infectious diseases and cancer, is expected to be ready as early as 2023 and will create up to 80 jobs. The minister stressed that the new investment must look at future needs too. “I would like to emphasise that we’re not just talking about meeting the immediate needs. Our partnership needs to look at the future needs as well and this facility will indeed do that, which is to look beyond the current COVID-19 situation and to see how best we can meet the regional and global needs,” said Mr Chan. “Even for COVID-19, we don't know how long this will last. But as soon as the facility comes on stream, we will be able to play a meaningful role for the rest of the region and the rest of the world.” Co-founder and CEO of BioNTech Ugur Sahintold reporters that the company began discussions about investing in Singapore “more than a year ago”. “This is the result of intensive due diligence and intensive interactions with local partners. We are convinced that Singapore is one of the best places to do that,” he added, citing a strong infrastructure, scientific ecosystem and talent pool for both manufacturing andR&D. Asked about the total value of BioNTech’s investment in Singapore, the chief executive officer would only say it is “in the range of hundreds of millions of US dollars”. He added that the company is exploring several options to make sure that the manufacturing facility here will be ready “as soon as possible”, such as acquiring an existing building or moving into established infrastructure.BioNTech is in talks with a number of potential partners on these options. Depending on how fast it establishes its headquarters and the size of the manufacturing site, the company could require more than 80 workers for various tasks, such as production, quality control and assurance. “This is the very first step,” said Dr Sahin. NEW FACILITY WON’T HELP WITH CURRENT VACCINE NEEDS: CEO That said, the upcoming manufacturing capacity in Singapore is unlikely to contribute to current vaccine needs. “We have to be clear that starting now a manufacturing building in Singapore will not help us in the next 12 months with regard to the global supply (of COVID-19 vaccines),” said Dr Sahin. “The global supply can only be addressed by increasing the existing production capacities. We did that and we will continue to do that in the next 12 months.” The plan is, together with Pfizer, deliver up to three billion doses this year - 50 per cent more than what was initially announced, he added. Of the three billion doses, more than 40 per cent will be supplied to low- and middle-income countries. BioNTech’s chief strategy officer Ryan Richardson said the company is looking at “a long-term investment” in Singapore. “It extends beyond COVID-19 and as it was mentioned, our hope here is that we can establish both a regional and even potentially global supply for a range of different vaccines and therapies based in Singapore,” he said. Having the site in Singapore will also mean that “a certain percentage (of vaccines manufactured here in future) would go to Singapore”, said Dr Sahin in response to a question. Asked if the 2023 timeframe for the new facility takes into account existing labour shortages in the construction sector, Mr Chan said: “Notwithstanding the disruption in the global supply chain, be it in materials or labour, together with EDB (Economic Development Board), we are able to prioritise our work schedule and our labour sources in order to support BioNTech to make sure that these facilities come online as soon as possible.” Downloadourappor subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

This comes as India continues to battle a new wave of COVID-19 infections, with hospitals starved of life-saving oxygen having to turn away patients. The Republic of Singapore Air Force will transport the cylinders on board two C-130 aircraft from Singapore to the state of West Bengal. Second Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Maliki Osman handed over the two planeloads of oxygen cylinders to India’s High Commissioner P Kumaran at Paya Lebar Air Base on Wednesday morning. “We have all witnessed in the past year how this pandemic is a transboundary threat,” Dr Maliki said at the air base. “It gives no regard for country, nationality, or race. This is exactly why we must work collectively to support each other,” he added. Singapore and India share a close relationship, Dr Maliki said, thanking the Indian government for continuing to work with Singapore throughout the pandemic by “keeping supply chains open and essential goods flowing”. “While our contribution is modest, we hope that it will bring comfort and relief to those in need and encourage those on the frontline in India, who are working tirelessly, to fight on,” Dr Maliki said. “I have no doubt that the fighting spirit of the Indian people will prevail.” Singapore investment firm Temasek has also sent medical equipment, including four cryogenic oxygen cylinders donated by India\\'s Tata Group. That consignment landed in West Bengal over the weekend. The Singapore Red Cross on Wednesday also launched a public appeal for funds to deliver assistance and support to communities in India. The funds will be used to purchase medical equipment and supplies, such as ventilators, oxygen cylinders and oxygen concentrators. The Singapore Red Cross has already bought and will deliver five ventilators to community hospitals in New Delhi through the Indian Red Cross Society, it said. \"As we start to raise more funds, SRC will be able to provide more lifesaving medical resources for the communities,\" it said.. Donations raised through the India Health Relief Fund, initiated and announced on Apr 26 by the Singapore Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and Little India Shopkeepers Association, will also be fully directed towards the Singapore Red Cross\\' public appeal. The explosion in infections in India - 360,960 new cases were recorded there on Wednesday alone - has driven a surge in global cases to about 148 million and the virus has now killed more than 3.1 million people worldwide. With a population of about 1.3 billion people, India has so far reported nearly 18 million COVID-19 infections and more than 200,000 deaths, although experts believe the true tally runs significantly higher. The United States, Britain, France, Germany, Canada, the European Union and the World Health Organization have also promised to rush supplies to India.

SINGAPORE: Within just 18 months of the first COVID-19 case being reported in Wuhan, more than 1.25 billion vaccine doses have been administered in 174 countries so far, roughly averaging 19.4 million doses a day – the equivalent of vaccinating more than three times the population of Singapore, daily. Some countries like Israel, the United States and the United Kingdom (UK) lead the charge. Two-thirds of UK’s population has received the first dose so far and nearly a third have received both doses. Singapore’s ramping up too, with 1.2 million people, or about 20 per cent of the population, completing the full vaccine regimen and 1.8 million people receiving at least one vaccine shot as of May 9, Health Minister Gan Kim Yong revealed in Parliament on Tuesday (May 11). Unless we can accelerate the rollout of vaccines, it should come as no surprise that at current vaccination rates, it could be several years before the world achieves herd immunity against SARS-CoV-2. The world marches out of COVID-19 at the pace of the slowest nation. So, the World Health Organization (WHO) has rightly emphasised the need for international cooperation in vaccination campaigns because a global pandemic requires global efforts to end it. THE SPREAD OF NEW VARIANTS With countries at different stages of their vaccination programmes and a few yet to begin, we face significant challenges in trying to protect the world’s population from this infection. As the coronavirus continues to circulate, infecting people who have not yet been vaccinated, mutants can spread and more variants are likely to develop. Some of these variants could even challenge the immunity provided by vaccines widely deployed in other countries. Mutations are intrinsic to viruses - they occur because viruses are constantly replicating, making copies of themselves. They inherently introduce errors, making their progeny different, helping the viruses to mutate and spread more effectively. In just over a year since the virus was formally identified, there are now thousands of genetic variants of SARS-CoV-2 circulating across the world. Most of these mutations are insignificant. Some may even limit the virus, but successful mutants make it more transmissible or evade existing immune mechanisms. The UK, South Africa, Brazil and India variants are notably differentiated by changes to their spike protein - the part of the virus which attaches to receptors on human cells and gains entry inside. This is the target for most of the world's vaccines. The UK strain is about 70 per cent more infectious, while the India, South Africa and Brazil variants have mutations that increase transmissibility and evade previous immunity. Tracking these existing or new variants are of paramount importance. It helps predict new waves of infection allowing resource planning. Our knowledge about these variants therefore needs to be constantly updated. Last week, Public Health England declared that a variant first identified in India – known as B16172- is a “variant of concern” due to evidence of greater transmissibility. It looks like the email address you entered is not valid. Weeks earlier, the Indian consortium INSACOG had flagged the possibility of a surge in infections, even before India was hit by a second wave of COVID-19. Success in tracking variants largely depends on our ability to detect the early signs of their emergence in communities which is difficult in large populations, especially if they’re spread out over expansive geographies. Real-time knowledge sharing between trans-national scientific networks is critical to keep up with the mutations. Beyond governments, collaborations between industry, academic and scientific institutions will prove crucial in setting up an early warning system. For instance, about a year into this pandemic, healthcare company Abbott activated a first-of-its-kind global scientific network, collaborating with leading institutions in North America, South America, Africa and Asia, to detect and rapidly respond to current and future pandemic threats. SUPPRESSING THE VARIANTS’ SPREAD The variants’ rapid advance in recent weeks, across some countries, underscores the importance of wearing masks, safe distancing and practicing good hand hygiene in suppressing their spread, even in the face of a successful vaccination programme. These public health measures form our first line of defence against the development of new mutations and critically, they can help buy us time to roll-out vaccination programmes across the world. Currently approved vaccines offer a significant degree of protection against variants. Early scientific data suggests development of some herd immunity. Even in vaccine failures - individuals who fall sick with detectable virus after vaccination - there was no reported secondary spread, albeit in a small group of 22 vaccinated people in Chicago. As more and more people are vaccinated or recover from a SARS-CoV-2 infection, our collective immunity rises. However, the verdict on the effectiveness of each vaccine to defend against the variants differs and remains wide open. As the variants spread and new mutations emerge, scientists have expressed confidence that they can deploy, and even re-engineer, existing vaccines to better tackle them. Vaccine makers such as Pfizer and Moderna have indicated that people may need a third dose after a few months, or receive a booster shot periodically, to help maintain immunity. This creates a dilemma in the immediate term – whether vaccine suppliers should focus on protecting people who have not yet been vaccinated or giving a booster shot to those who have already been vaccinated. Vaccinating as many people as possible should always be our top priority because some protection is better than none. WHO GETS THE VACCINE? There are options however to manage these trade-offs. With global demand for vaccines far outstripping supply, lifting intellectual property protections would boost vaccine availability and remove barriers to equitable access. That said, making vaccines is a complex endeavour. Increasing supply will take some months, if not years, even if vaccines are produced at warp speed. German bio-tech company BioNTech announced on Monday (May 10) it is setting up a manufacturing plant in Singapore to produce vaccines for Southeast Asia, but the facility will not be operational until 2023. But we don’t have to despair as there’s another option. Until supplies can be ramped up, another tool that could be used to boost vaccine access, to some degree, is quantitative antibody testing. Antibodies are infection-fighting proteins produced to defend against a viral attack, while vaccines trigger the creation of antibodies. There are several types of antibodies but simplistically, the quantity and presence of some specific antibodies in the body can help doctors determine the level of immunity provided by a vaccine. The level of immune response generated by the vaccine or the virus may be different in different people with different immunity. Quantitative antibody tests, made by diagnostic companies such as Siemens, Abbott and Roche are specifically designed to detect the presence of these particular antibodies that can help determine a person’s level of immunity. Whereas the Singapore-developed cPass test can detect whether a person has neutralising antibodies which can prevent the coronavirus from infecting a patient's cells. The key is that these antibody tests can measure immune response and provide insights for doctors to understand how an individual can cope with a potential coronavirus infection. Antibody testing therefore has great value in helping to prioritise people who need the third dose the most by identifying those with low levels of immunity. Admittedly, these simple tests do not measure other defence cells such as T cells which could also kick-in and provide protection. Such tests are laborious and difficult to interpret and are usually left in the realms of research. By prioritising who receives the third booster shot, we can ensure that no dose of the vaccine is unnecessarily administered to a person who may have adequate immunity. This would minimise the need to administer the booster en masse, freeing up critical infrastructure and resources, and helping to achieve greater vaccine equity. This could become a key tool in helping the world achieve herd immunity faster by deploying vaccines where they are most needed. Judicious antibody testing can therefore be an able ally in the race to vaccinate the world. With every additional person that’s vaccinated earlier, the playground for the virus shrinks, inch by inch.

       " {'text': \"singapore travel restrictions india hong kong bubble latest 14709690 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners From the on-off Singapore-Hong Kong travel bubble to the simultaneous tightening and loosening of rules depending on travel history, this responsiveness is a boon to be preserved, says NUS Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health’s Dr Alex Cook. SINGAPORE: Last week’s announcement that Singapore was stopping travel from India the next day was another display of a pattern shown throughout the pandemic. It was another example of Singapore rapidly implementing policy changes in response to the changing epidemiology of the pandemic, in particular, the surge in cases in India. Early last year, Singapore was one of the first countries to screen for COVID-19 at the border, and later to ban entry to travellers from high-risk countries. Since then,border measureshave continued to evolve. Arguably, Singapore’s policy response and readiness to adapt policies as needed, is the major reason why the death rate is less than 1 per cent of that seen in most other industrialised countries. That fact is gaining international recognition: A Bloomberg story on Monday (Apr 26) ranks Singapore as the best place to be, looking at its infection and death rates, and as the country ramps up vaccination. RULES TIGHTENED AND RELAXED AT THE SAME TIME Travel rules are a big part of this story. Singapore’s variegated border policy, which puts travellers from different countries into risk groups based on their current epidemiology and imposes different requirements for each, is a pragmatic approach to border control. On the one hand, with India’s outbreak having spiralled out of control in recent weeks, the decision to close the border for the time being is a sensible one, despite the disruption it will cause. In contrast, however, border policies were last week relaxed for travellers from the UK and South Africa — to bring them in line with travellers from most of the world — and from Hong Kong. This seems contradictory on the surface. But for the UK and South Africa, this was a reflection of the variants bearing their names now being found in many other countries, and the falling transmission rates in both countries meaning they no longer warranted additional measures. Similarly, travellers from Hong Kong, whose winter outbreak has subsided, will now be able to serve a shorter period of quarantine — just seven days — than most overseas arrivals, and may do so at home rather than a hotel. STAYING AT ZERO CASES ISN’T PRACTICAL People have asked, why not close our borders to travellers entirely rather than expose Singaporeans to COVID-19 risks. It looks like the email address you entered is not valid. But this zero-tolerance approach, similar to that taken by New Zealand or Taiwan, requires an impervious border, laying aside the need for no leakage from quarantine into the communityand strict response should any leakage occur. Such a strategy would not be practical in Singapore, given its dependence on labour and goods from overseas and over the Causeway. Rather, Singapore’s approach is to reduce, but not eliminate, the risk. Each layer in the border fence, from pre-departure testing, to testing after arrival, and quarantine, filters out some additional infections from reaching the community. This approach works because we have identified a combination of policies over the last year that have kept the reproduction rate of the virus within the community below the level at which epidemics grow. This combination — the availability of testing in primary care, routine use of testing among high-risk groups, the mask wearing, social distancing, and use of TraceTogether and SafeEntry — has been shown to mop up any spill-over from the border. Over the last six months, there have been almost 3,000 imported cases, yet fewer than 100 community cases. This represents 100 chances to have sparked an epidemic, yet none led to a self-sustaining outbreak. The virus’ failure to do so is not because of our good luck. It’s a reflection of a policy that works. TAKING A RISK-BASED APPROACH Allowing shorter quarantine for low-risk travellers, and longer quarantine for higher-risk ones, allows the economic gains from travel while keeping the risk of disease spread in check. Take a city like Hong Kong, where the incidence is similar to that of Singapore, for example. An exchange of travellers — one planeload going each way — does not change the risk ledger for either place. If you come into contact with a traveller from Hong Kong on the MRT, there isn’t any extra risk compared to a Singaporean in the same carriage, and vice versa on the MTR. If anything, because travellers have to take COVID-19 tests, you are less likely to acquire infection from a travellers from a low-risk country than a general member of the population in Singapore. (Listen toexperts discusswhat a post-pandemic travel world will look like on CNA's Heart of the Matter podcast:) THE TROUBLE WITH TRAVEL BUBBLES However, two opposing forces are at play on travel bubbles between countries of a similar risk. One is the need to respond quickly to a worsening situation at the other side of the bubble, potentially requiring one side unilaterally to pop the bubble. Examples include the Hong Kong–Singapore bubble, which was stymied by Hong Kong’s winter outbreak, and the Tasman Sea bubble, which was partially paused last week after a case in Perth was identified. However, the second force is predictability. The popping of the Hong Kong–Singapore bubble, and earlier examples such as rushed quarantine imposition by the UK in the midst of the European summer holiday season, disrupted many people’s plans to reunite with family, meet friends, or go on a honeymoon. The cessation of travel from India will undoubtedly have economic repercussions for Singapore. The unpredictability of border changes, and the fear that many Singaporeans overseas had in March 2020 — of being left stranded far from home as borders closed — led to a rush back that, arguably, we were unprepared for. Then, many brought SARS-CoV-2 infections with them, leading to local spread and the eventual need to launch the circuit breaker. For individuals and families, the unpredictability of travelling within a bubble, without knowing whether one side will pop it, is a substantial disincentive to planning a trip. VACCINATIONS MAY CHANGE THE PICTURE The ever-increasing roll out of vaccines, however, may change the picture favourably for the travel industry. Vaccination acts like a further filter on top of the other border measures in place. A traveller from the US, for example, who has been vaccinated may have the same risk of spreading disease as an unvaccinated traveller from China and if so could potentially be subject to light-touch measures on arrival without exposing the community to excessive risk. Infectious disease experts think the vaccinated passenger is less likely than the unvaccinated passenger to develop disease and pass the infection, though to what extent and how to deal with vaccinated passengers from countries with high infection rates are still under study. But the flattening of the epidemic curve in Israel, where new cases have come down to fewer than 100 each day from a high of 10,000 after vaccinations started in December 2020, is cause for optimism. Policy changes to make it easier to travel into Singapore if vaccinated would bring economic benefits and be in line with the pragmatic approach the government has taken to date. At the same time, policies allowing vaccinated Singaporeans to return from overseas travel may also need to be tuned to the level of risk in their destination. Doing so is made harder by the ever-changing epidemic situation overseas. Nevertheless, travel could be facilitated by establishing clear guidance on the criteria a destination must continue to meet for vaccinated Singaporean travellers there to have shortenedor noquarantine on their return, similar to the explicit thresholds for locally-transmitted cases set in our bubble with Hong Kong. Importantly, these criteria need to be clear to the public, who will want to have some confidence that a trip booked months in advance will not be cancelled at the last minute. Authorities should also provide updates on how close destinations are to bursting the threshold on a daily basis, so families can make alternative plans. Our responsive policies have shielded Singapore from the worst of the pandemic, while remaining pragmatic to economic and social needs. Having clear criteria determining what borders will remain open and under what conditions for vaccinated Singaporeans will be an important step towards normalcy. \\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200bListen to aviation observers dissect the future facing national flag carriers after the pandemic and the role of Singapore Airlines on CNA's Heart of the Matter published in September 2020: Alex R Cook in an associate professor who leads the Biostatistics and Modelling Domain and serves as the vice dean of research at the NUS Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health.

       " {'text': 'covid 19 parents more prepared children home based learning 14827352 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: Home-based learning during the \"circuit breaker\" period last year was a “nightmare” for Mrs Maria Ang and her family. Her three children, now aged 12, 16 and 20 years were doing home-based learning, and both parents were working from home at the time, said Mrs Ang, an administrator. At the time, they had just moved into a new flat and had no access to the Internet.The Wi-Fi service took time to be set up, andthe family ended upbuying a data card, she told CNA. “Everybody was crammed at the dining table. My husband was having meetings, and I was there, I was irritated. He can hear me, and I can hear him, so it’s noisy,” the 46-year-old said. However, those issues have since been ironed out, and Mrs Ang said that herfamily is prepared forhome-based learningwhen itstarts onWednesday (May 19). “We bought normal desks for each individual room, and everybody’s got their own space to do their own stuff. That’s why if there’s a second or third wave or any lockdown, we are quite prepared,” she said. The Government announced on Sunday that all primary and secondary schools, as well as junior colleges and Millennia Institute, will shift to full home-based learning from Wednesday until the end of the term on May 28, amid a rise in COVID-19 cases in Singapore. The new rules did not come as a surprise given the \"very unstable\" COVID-19 situation, said Mrs Ang, adding that mentally, her familyisprepared for home-based learning. Nevertheless, some challenges remain, as her 12-year-old son has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and is autistic. “I think people equate working from home as being able to help with home-based learning but actually it’s a bit difficult because he will be doing his own stuff and I will be doing my stuff, and I will be having my meetings and all that, so it could be quite challenging.” However, she is thankful that the stipulated period is only two weeks and not longer. The school term ends on May 28, before the start of the June school holidays. Her employer is also understanding that she may not be “on the ball” in the mornings on some days during the period of home-based learning and has been supportive, she said. Ms Elizabeth Soh, 33, whose daughter is in Primary 1, said she and her husbandare “slightly better equipped” for home-based learning this time, after last year’s experience. Last year, her daughter used an old laptop for her lessons. “We had all kinds of problems that we didn’t anticipate ...things like connectivity in her room. We had to buy a router to extend the Wi-Fi,” she said. This time,they will be letting her use an iPad, and she will have her own desk with good lighting. “She’s going to be looking at the screen all day so I also ordered an anti-glare, anti-blue light screen protector for her iPad,” she said. She added that when her daughter\\'sschool gives more information, they will work out a timetable for her, to create a setting as similar to school as possible. This includesscheduling break times and gettingher to ask for permission to go to the toilet. “(These are) just things to make it as normal as possible, to make it feel like yes, she’s still in a classroom setting, and that it’s not an early holiday,” she said. Her daughter’s school did a survey last week to find out more aboutpupils’ access to devices, she added. “I’ll be worried that should she miss out or not catch up, she’s going to struggle later when school is back to normal. In K2, when they go back to school, the teachers will have time to dedicate to individual students to help them catch up,” she said. Ms Soh, a business owner, will not be able to work from home, but said she will set up the device for her daughter every morning and go through the schedule with her. She willhave to “keep calling and asking my helper to check up on her to make sure she (her daughter) is focusing”, she said. She will return home daily by about 4pm, and her husband will start working from home next week, she added. SENDING CHILDREN TO PRE-SCHOOL Ms Soh, who also has a two-year-old son, said that she will be continuing to send him to pre-school so that those at home can work without distraction. Pre-schools remain open, although the Government said it encourages parents to keep their children at home where possible. “She’s lucky she has her own room and she can do home-based learning inside, but it’s still very distracting for everyone at home to have a two-year-old running around while everyone is trying to work,” she said. Another parent who is continuing to send her two-year-old and four-year-old children to pre-school is Ms Stephanie Lim Yan. The housewife said that they attend pre-school for three hours a day. “I find that it keeps me more sane. Three hours with them at home feels like 30 hours, especially when they fight a lot,\" said the 34-year-old, adding that both her children require her attention at the same time. She saidthat she feels that it is safe to send them to pre-schoolas the pre-school is thorough in its screening process whenallowing students to enter. It alsohas strictsafe management measures. The parents said that there has beena drop in attendance attheir children’s classes. KEEPING CHILDREN AT HOME Some parents, like Ms Khaliesah Mohamed Hatta, are choosing to stop sending their children to pre-school. The 33-year-old is keeping her three-year-old daughter at home until community cases dip, she said. The university programme manager and her husband are working from home. A COVID-19 case has been detected at White Sands shopping mall in Pasir Ris, close to where they stay. With her daughter also attending a pre-school in the area and having just recovered from an illness,she wanted to \"err on the side of caution\". “The reason we sendher to school at such a young age is because she gets engaged in school. Her energy is released there and she gets great socialisation, but over here at home, it’s challenging to have to juggle work and engage her at the same time,” she said. She saidthat she is thankful her daughter and her eight-month-old son can keep each other entertained at times. “I have a helper but I cannot expect her to watch them 100 per cent of the time. She has to do housework, she has to cook,” she said, adding that the three adults at home take turns to watch the children. Ms Charmain Lee, a 34-year-old housewife also stopped sending her four-year-old daughter to pre-school. “We are all at home, and she’s the only one out there in school. I feel that it’s not very fair to her, that she’s being exposed to all these things and all of us are safe at home,” she said. “If everybody does their part to help out in their little way here and there … I’m just hoping we don’t go into another circuit breaker.” Downloadourappor subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

       " {'text': 'covid 19 stay home notice cost hotels staycation cancellations 14754972 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: Many inbound travellers to Singapore are facingheftier costs for stay-home notice (SHN) dedicated facilities, after authorities announced on Tuesday (May 4) that those from higher-risk areaswould have to quarantine for 21 days, up from 14 days. These travellers willhave to pay about S$3,000 for their three-week stayin a dedicated facility, up from the initial S$2,000 for two weeks, according to the Immigration andCheckpoints Authority (ICA). The extended quarantine starting Saturday will apply to travellers from all places except Australia, Brunei,China, New Zealand, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau. Those currently serving their stay-home notice andhaveyet to complete it before this date will also have to serve another seven days at their stay-home noticelocation. Travellers thatCNA spoke to say the news came as a surprise —throwing plans into disarray while burninga largerhole in their pockets. “(The cost) was initially S$2,150. I sent ICA an email and they are saying it will cost up to S$1,200 more, which is not a small amount,” said31-year-old Singaporean Max Lim, whose Vietnamese fiancee is due to arrive in Singapore next week. The longer quarantine period has also presented a bigger headache for the couple. Theywill be forced to miss an in-person appointment to verify their personal documents on May 31, ahead of their Registry of Marriage (ROM) ceremony on June 6. “So if a video verification isn\\'t approved (for May 31), I\\'ll have to re-apply (for an) ROM date again,” said Mr Lim, adding that he may also have to cancel the venue booked for the event. Withlimited information available online, navigating the changes has been “mentally strenuous” said Mr Lim. He was also planning to book a post-quarantine surprise for his fiancee. “Luckily, I haven\\'t booked, if not I wouldneed to change it too.” “WE MIGHT HAVE RECONSIDERED COMING BACK”: TRAVELLER The news is also a tough pill to swallow for Charlane Yu, a 31-year-old Singaporean currently serving her stay-home notice with her husband. Ms Yu is almost six months pregnant. “We have been here for four days and it already feels like quite a long time. “We are in a room without fresh air …. and it’s really hard for me. I feel very breathless and uncomfortable most of the time,” said Ms Yu, who just returned from Germany. She has requested twice for a room with windows that can be opened, but to no avail – which is why the news of the extended stay-home noticeleft her distraught. The extra costs are another worry, she told CNA. “We didn’t budget for this extra $1,000for this trip. We are expecting a new baby so financially, already it’s quite difficult. Suddenly there’s this amount of cash we need to fork out and we feel … it’s a bit unfair,” said Ms Yu. “If we knew the stay-home noticewas going to be 21 days and the cost was higher, we might have reconsidered coming back here.” \"In a sense, I feel (authorities)are doing the right thing, but it\\'s just very sudden,\" she said. STAYCATIONS CANCELLED BY HOTELS With the extension of the stay-home notice period, more hotel rooms are also being earmarked as quarantine facilities for incomingtravellers. The multi-ministry task force for COVID-19 said on Tuesday that government agencies are engaging with hotels to build up sufficient capacity for when the measures are tightened. But enlisting more rooms for this purpose has meant morecancellations of staycations at various hotels, including the Grand Park Orchard. In an email seen by CNA, the hotel said it is “assisting” the Government with COVID-19 efforts, and that it would be closed to the public until further notice. “As such, we are not able to facilitate your upcoming stay at our hotel,” it told guests. The hotel added that guests canget a partial refund, postpone their stay, or switch to other eligible options using their SingapoRediscover Voucherson the Klook booking platform. One guest, who only wanted to be known as Chloe, got the news on Wednesdaythat her hotel booking for next week hasbeen cancelled. “I felt disappointed because (it) was something I was really looking forward to since we are unable to travel out of Singapore. “However, I suppose the cancellation or postponement is also a way to ensure the safety of all guests and I’m grateful that the hotel is allowing us to postpone it without additional charges,” said the civil servant. Selected floors of the Mandarin Orchard hotel\\'s main tower will also be used as stay-home notice dedicated facilities. “In view of this arrangement, we will be allowing guests to defer their stay date or cancel their confirmed booking,” said a notice on its website. In response toCNA\\'s queries on staycation cancellations, the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) and Ministry of National Development (MND) said STB is \"implementing a processto allow any vouchers used on affected bookings to be refunded to the user’s digital (SingapoRediscover Vouchers\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b) account\".

       " {'text': 'covid 19 singapore hong kong travel bubble ong ye kung 14696014 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: Singapore and Hong Kong have agreed to set May 26 as the launch date of their travel bubble, both cities announced on Monday (Apr 26). Stricter conditions will be introduced for the travel bubble\\'s resumption. This includes travellers having to remain in Singapore or Hong Kong in the last 14 days prior to departure, excluding any time spent in quarantine or stay-home notice. Hong Kong also requires its residents to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 before departing on the flights, with some exceptions made for children and those not suitable for vaccination on medical grounds. Travellers from Singapore will have to download and install Hong Kong\\'s LeaveHomeSafe app before departing. The travel bubble will be suspended if the seven-day moving average of unlinked community cases in either city increases to above five. It can only resume when the COVID-19 situation has stabilised, said the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS). The travel bubble was originally scheduled to begin in November last year, but wasdeferred due to a spike in COVID-19 cases in Hong Kong. Under the travel bubble, there areno restrictions on the purpose of travel and no requirements for a controlled itinerary or sponsorship. Visitors have to take pre-departure and on-arrival COVID-19 swab tests and travel on designated flights operated by Singapore Airlines and Cathay Pacific. \"The COVID-19 situation in Hong Kong has improved, with very few local unlinked COVID-19 cases over the past few weeks. Community cases in Singapore remained very low throughout the time,\" said Singapore\\'s Ministry of Transport (MOT). \"The risk profiles of both cities are therefore now similar.\" Both cities will closely monitor the COVID-19 situation from now to May 26, and will proceed with the launch \"if the situation continues to be steady and under control in both cities\", the ministry said. TRAVEL BUBBLE TO BEGIN \"CAUTIOUSLY\" The Singapore-Hong Kong travel bubble will begin \"cautiously\", with one flight a day in each direction, said MOT. Each flight will have a cap of 200 passengers, with the numbers reviewed after the first two weeks. Singapore\\'s Transport Minister Ong Ye Kung said the travel bubble is a significant move between two aviation and financial services hubs in Asia. \"I am happy that Hong Kong got the COVID-19 situation under control,\" he said. \"It has been a long few months, but the conditions are now ripe again to re-launch the ATB (air travel bubble). Both sides will need to stay very vigilant in the next one month, so that we can launch the first flights smoothly.\" Hong Kong\\'s Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Edward Yau said the goal is to strike a balance between public health and travel convenience. \"The re-launch of ATB not only meets the aspirations of the people and business communities on cross-border travel, but also signifies that gradual resumption of cross-border travel is achievable through mutual collaborations among different places,\" said Mr Yau. CAN\\'T BE CERTAIN \"EVERYTHING WILL BE SMOOTH SAILING\": ONG The relaunch of the travel bubble was set on May 26 for a number of reasons, Mr Ong told reporters on Monday. Hong Kong requested enough time for its residents to get vaccinated before travelling. The lead time also gives the industry and travellers more time to prepare, he said. Singapore will ensure that COVID-19 infections remain at a \"very, very low level\", Mr Ong said. \"You can\\'t say for sure that everything will be smooth sailing,\" he said when asked about whether a recent spate of COVID-19 transmissions in Singapore might result in another round of delays for the bubble. \"Stop-start situations\" have become the norm for such travel arrangements, he noted. One of the factors that would lead to the suspension of the travel bubble is if the seven-day moving average of unlinked community cases in either city increases to more than five. For Singapore, this number excludes cases in migrant worker dormitories, where more than 90 per cent of Singapore’s coronavirus cases emerged last year. When asked why this was the case, Mr Ong replied that the risk of an unlinked COVID-19 case in the community was much higher than that in the dormitories. “In the dorm, it’s a different environment. You can lock down the dorm. In the community, you can’t lock down a town. You can’t lock down Toa Payoh, you can’t lock down Ang Mo Kio,” he said. The dormitories are under “very robust surveillance”, he noted, pointing to the movement restrictions still in place on migrant workers as well as regular testing against COVID-19. Though Hong Kong requires that its residents be vaccinated against COVID-19 beforetravelling to Singapore under the bubble, there is no similar requirement for visitors from Singapore. Mr Ong said Hong Kong\\'svaccination requirement is an “extra incentive” for its residents to get vaccinated, and that Singapore’s vaccination rates have been good so far. Rather, the top priority for reopening travel is that the destinations that Singapore partners with are “safe”, he said. Places where Singapore has already unilaterally opened its borders to – such as Australia, Brunei, China, New Zealand and Taiwan –are “natural partners” for futuretravel bubbles, said Mr Ong. He noted the Taiwanese authorities are now studying proposals from Singapore for such a bubble, as well as for the mutual recognition of vaccination certificates.

       " {'text': 'hari raya celebrations muslime adjust plans covid 19 singapore 14748396 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: The coming Hari Raya will be Namira Nasir’s last before she gets married, and the 29-year-old was looking forward to gathering with friends and family after a long, tiring year. But the tightened COVID-19 measures announced on Tuesday (May 4)“added to the melancholy” of moving out of her family home, she said. From May 8 to 30, social gatherings will becapped at five people in a group, down from eight.Households will similarly be able to receive only up to five distinct visitors per day. In addition, the Health Ministry\\'s advice is for people to keep to a maximum of two social gatherings daily. While the measures are not a huge change for her family, she said, since they have been \"cautious\"about meeting elderly relatives during the pandemic, they had been optimistic about the improvement in the situation a few weeks ago before COVID-19 cases rose again. \"The mood dampener was exacerbated by the contrast inoptimism we had up untila few weeks ago. The situation now makes us feel a bit demotivated, but we’re already going into our last week of Ramadan so we’re just trying to make it to the end as best as we can,\" she told CNA. \"I think the bigger impact (of the revised measures) will come from the increasingly tense situation with the rising number of cases. That would, and should, make people more careful about their gatherings.” This is the second Hari Raya that Muslims will be celebrating under the cloud of the pandemic. Last year, Ramadan and Hari Raya fell during the COVID-19 \"circuit breaker\" when social gatherings at homes and public spaces were not allowed. Even before the stricter measures were announced on Tuesday, Afiq Anwarsaid his family “didn’t have high hopesof celebrating Raya to its full scale this year\". \"Even so, everyone was secretly a little frustrated at the five-person limit for gatherings,\" the 26-year-oldadded. “Reducing the number to five essentially prohibits visiting of any kind on my mum\\'s side of the family.\" Pre-pandemic, his family used tofind a designated day for Iftar to break fast at one house. Large family gatherings on Hari Raya were also common, said Afiq, such as travelling in a convoy to relatives’ houses or gathering at his paternal grandmother’s house to feast for the entire day. ADAPTING TO CHANGE With Singapore\\'s vaccination programme under way, Ahmad Musta\\'ain Khamis said hisfamily will think about whether those who have not been fully vaccinated, like Ahmad himself, would stay home to protect their elderly relatives. His family hadbeen preparing to receive guests this year. “Last year, my mum didn’t prepare much kueh,\" said the 34-year-old. \"This year, we went to the kueh bazaar, planned a roster for visitors, and I even got myself an infrared thermometer to scan people’s forehead at the door.\" But Ahmad said he understands that tradition shouldtake a backseat for now. “Of course there’s a strong sentimentality to hold on to practices. But culture is continually changing – and what changes will depend on things like safety, preference and laws,” he added. Safety was also top of the mind for 47-year-oldAidli Mosbit, who is getting married and having a wedding reception atFullerton Bay Hotel on May 22. It is intended to be a“three-in-one” event celebrating the marriage, Hari Raya and her future husband’s birthday. With about 100 guests, she said she was concerned about whether there needsto be a medical team on-site for pre-event COVID-19 testing and whethervaccinated guests will be exempted from testing. Under the new rules which kick in on May 8,pre-event testing will be required for all attendees if the wedding reception involves more than 50 people. This limit is currently set at 100. “As an educator, I come from a place where safety comes first. We don’t want to get ourselves into trouble. I’m not angry,it’s just anxiety because there are things we need to put in place,” she said. Unless “anything major” happens to derail her plans, Aidli plans to go ahead with the event. “We are still in pandemic mode, so we might not be able to visit all our friends and family. My fianceand I wanted to use our wedding to gather our loved ones,” she said. Dr Norhisham Main,president of the Muslim Healthcare Professional Association, said Muslims can look at the new restrictions as \"a minor setback\". It is\"not as bad as last year\" during the circuit breakersince home visits are allowed now. \"As theseare the last few days of Ramadan, Muslims can also look at this from the perspective of giving and sacrifice,\" said DrNorhisham, whowas also a member of the former Malay Muslim COVID-19 Workgroup. \"We will do our part to overcome thenew clusters, and hopefully with these new measures, we\\'re able to curtail the rise in infections.\" Downloadourappor subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

All other parents will be restricted from entering the premises, the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) said on Wednesday (May 5). The tighter restrictions will be in place from May 8 to May 30.They are in line with Singapore\\'sPhase 3 \"heightened alert\" stance announced by the COVID-19 multi-ministry task force on Tuesday, said ECDA. Visitors will be subject to safemanagement measures, including mask wearing,temperature and health checks up to three times a day, more frequent hand washing and regular disinfection of high-touch surfaces. Pre-schools and early intervention centres are advised to conduct parent-teacher conferences online, and to tap on virtual tours for parents of prospective students. Pre-schools are also required to ensure that people conducting supplementary enrichment programmes serve no more than four pre-schools during this period, to reduce the risk of transmission across schools. Exceptions will be made for providers of the Development Support-Learning Support programme and Development Support Plus programme, which cater to children with developmental needs. NO MIXING ACROSS CLASSES During this period, pre-schools will also be required to tighten the movement of their staff and children. Children can only participate in activities within their own class and in small groups, with no mixing of children across classes. Early intervention centres will conduct their sessions in groups of five, down from eight, in line with national guidelines. Pre-schools and early interventioncentres can conduct outdoor activities during this period but will do so in smaller groups. Large group activities and activities at external venues, such as field trips and learning journeys, will be temporarily suspended to minimise interaction between different classes. Pre-schools will also be required to conduct all staff meetings and training online. \"Face-to-face external training may continue only for limited courses such as the hands-on aspect of child first aid training,\" said ECDA. TraceTogether-only SafeEntry will also be implemented in pre-schools and early intervention centres from May 17, in tandem with the national roll-out. Visitors and staff must check in using their TraceTogethertoken or mobile application to be allowed entry, and must have their token or the application with them while in the school. Children under seven are not required to use TraceTogether. ECDA also encouraged parents to monitorthe health of their children, seek medical attention promptly and not bring them to the pre-schools orcentres if their children feel unwell. Staff are also encouraged to seek medical attention promptly.

       " {'text': \"india singapore visitors covid 19 not nationality ong ye kung 14697218 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: Singapore’s move to stop the entry ofvisitors who have recent travel history to Indiais not based on nationality, said Transport Minister Ong Ye Kung on Monday (Apr 26). As of 11.59pm last Friday, all long-term pass holders and short-term visitors who have travelled to India in the last 14 days are not allowed to enter Singapore. This includesvisitors whotransit in India and thosewho had earlier obtained approval for entry into Singapore. The border measure was implemented amid a spike in COVID-19 infections in India. On Monday, the country's daily coronavirus cases set a new global record for the fifth straight day. With 352,991 new cases, India's total caseload has crossed 17 million. Deaths rose by a record 2,812 to reach a total of 195,123. When asked about reports that Indian nationals are going to other countries before coming to Singapore in a bid to get past the border restrictions, Mr Ong said: “I think, as a matter of general infection control knowledge, regardless of your nationality, if you stay in a place long enough, you assume the risk profile of that place. “You may be from another country, but once you stay in a new country for a while, you assumea new risk profile.” If the policy is to target Indian nationals, then “something is wrong”, added the Transport Minister, who was speaking after announcing the new launch date of the Hong Kong-Singapore air travel bubble. “But if your policy is to target risk, thenfor someone from a high-risk country to move to a lower risk country, stay there for some time, and after that remain non COVID-positive, remain negative, and then come to Singapore … they have lowered the risk in that process,” added Mr Ong. When asked if someone from India might transit for less than a day before coming toSingapore, Mr Ong stressed that such a passenger would not be allowed entry. Last Thursday, co-chair of the multi-ministry task force Lawrence Wong said that the new measures were a “temporary freeze” on arrivals from India, and that it will give Singapore time to monitor the situation there and better understand the “new variants that are there and the risk that they pose to us”. Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said the measures are “necessary” because if there is an influx of cases, they may transmit to Singapore’s dormitories or community, and the country might “end up with a major outbreak again”. Adding that Singapore is also concerned with healthcare capacity, Mr Gan said: “We want to do what we can to minimise the risk of the next cluster and the next wave, so that we have sufficient capacity of our healthcare facilities to be able to respond should that eventuality happen.” Downloadourappor subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

SPF said it received a call for assistance to a case of dispute at 18 Raffles Quay on Saturday at 10.16pm. It was the first day of Singapore\\'s return to Phase 2 COVID-19 reopening measures, with social gatherings reduced to a maximum of five people from eight in Phase 3. The officer had explained the new rule to a group of diners during the dispute, as seen in a video of the incident posted by Max Mamba in the Facebook group Complaint Singapore. \"The regulation today is we cannot accept more than five,\" said the officer. The diners then rebutted him, with one of them saying: \"The table is two\" (sic). \"Listen to me first,\" the officer said, prompting a man from the group to shout: \"Who are you to ask me to listen to you?\" In the nearly three-minute-long video, several profanities are heard - some appearing to target the officer.

       " {'text': 'additional restrictions under phase 2 heightened alert Further Restrictions Under Phase 2 (Heightened Alert)Over the past two weeks several clusters of infections have emerged, coupled with a pattern of local unlinked community cases. These developments have demonstrated higher attack rates and secondary transmission occurs in “mask-off” settings, households, and at eateries. Given this, the Multi-Ministry Taskforce announced additional measures and restrictions under Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) to minimise transmission of the virus in a swift and decisive manner. These measures are additional measures to what was announced on 4 May 2021.To reduce risks of community transmission, indoor “mask-off” activities such as dine-in F&B establishments will cease. Other activities which will also not be allowed during this period include strenuous indoor exercise class or strenuous individual and group indoor sports and exercise activities. In addition, personalised services which require masks to be removed (e.g. facials and saunas), singing, and the playing of instruments that require intentional expulsion of air (e.g. wind or brass instruments) will also not be allowed.The following measures will take effect from Sunday, 16 May 2021 through to Sunday, 13 June 2021.

Additionally, the Government will provide one month of rental waiver for hawker stall and coffeeshop tenants of Government agencies. Commercial landlords are urged to support their F&B tenants through this period. Expansion of Testing Strategy for Quicker ResponseFor swifter detection of possible cases, the Antigen Rapid Testing (ART) will be administed to all who present themselves with Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI) symptoms at the Swab and Send Home (SASH) Public Health Preparedness Clinics (PHPCs), Polyclinics, Emergency Departments and Regional Swab Centres (RSCs). This ART will be done together with the COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test that all such patients will already have been subjected to. Both the ART and the PCR tests will be funded by the Government for all individuals with ARI symptoms. While the ART is less accurate than the PCR test, it has a quicker turnaround time which will allow for the authorities to take swifter public health actions for those who test positive for the ART test. Vaccination Remains CriticalVaccination remains critical in the fight against COVID-19. As of 13 May, about 1.9 million individuals have received at least one dose of the vaccine, of whom about 1.3 million individuals have received their second dose and completed the full vaccination regimen. The recent cases illustrate that vaccination may not eliminate the risks of the infection completely, but it does provide significant protections against infections and helps to reduce the severity of the disease and onward transmission. It is therefore important to be vaccinated when offered.For more information, clickherefor MOH’s press release.', 'id': '832857b4-4de4-487c-8462-ed56e3ef997e', 'score': None, 'probability': None, 'question': None, 'meta': {'category': 'articles'}, 'embedding': None},\n",
       " {'text': 'update on covid 19 vaccination programme and guidance on the use of masks Singapore continues to make steady progress with our vaccination programme. As of 17 May, more than 3.4 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine were administered, with close to 2 million individuals who have received at least the first dose of the vaccine. To date, about 71% of eligible seniors aged 60 and above, and close to 66% of eligible persons aged 45 to 59 years old have received the COVID-19 vaccination or booked their vaccination appointments. Start of vaccination for those aged 40 to 44 years oldThe next band of those aged 40 to 44 years old will be invited to register for their COVID-19 vaccinations from Wednesday, 19 May 2021. Singapore’s supply of vaccines has been steadily coming in but remains limited given the high global demand. Singapore will continue to roll out the vaccination programme, but now in five-year age bands – starting with those aged 40 to 44 years old and progressively moving to younger age groups.Individuals can only register online via vaccine.gov.sg Upon their registration, they will receive an acknowledgement SMS A separate SMS with a personalised booking link to book a vaccination appointment will then be progressively sent to invite eligible individuals on a first-come-first-served basis, based on their time of registration Individuals should expect to receive this booking SMS within 1 to 2 weeks from registration, with appointment slots available up to mid-June Those who have registered their interest previously will not need to re-register More appointment slots for vaccination will be made available as more supplies arrive. Singapore remains on track with our COVID-19 vaccination programme. Extension of the vaccine dosing interval to between 6 to 8 weeksTo provide vaccines for more people, the Multi-Ministry Taskforce on COVID-19 will be prioritising first doses of the vaccines and extending the interval between the first and second doses from 3 or 4 weeks, to 6 to 8 weeks. This will apply to vaccination registrations that occur from Wednesday, 19 May 2021. Those who already have appointments for their second doses will not be affected. This approach is adopted in consultation with the Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination which had studied scientific evidence globally in clinical trials and real-world roll-out of these vaccines. The maximum interval between mRNA COVID-19 vaccines could be extended to up to eight weeks to maximise vaccine coverage, without materially impacting the eventual overall immune response, as long as the second dose is eventually administered. This conclusion is based on the data from the original mRNA trials, which has been bolstered recently by emerging information from real-world observations, laboratory studies and simulations. The approach of prioritising first dose vaccinations has also been adopted by countries such as the United Kingdom and Germany. HSA approval of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for those aged 12 to 15 years oldAs for individuals aged 12 to 15 years old, the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) has authorised the use of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine under Pandemic Special Access Route (PSAR). The Expert Committee has also endorsed this extension of the interim authorisation of the vaccine by HSA to this age group. The Committee considered the safety, efficacy and tolerability of the vaccine, and the study design of clinical trials for this age group. The data showed that the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine demonstrated high efficacy consistent with that observed in the adult population. Its safety profile is also consistent with the known safety profile in the adult population and the standards set for other registered vaccines used in the immunisation against other diseases.The Ministry of Health (MOH) will work with the Ministry of Education (MOE) on vaccination for this school-going age group and provide further updates in due course. Improvingaccess to COVID-19 vaccination for homebound personsTofacilitate the vaccination of homebound persons who are unable to travel to avaccination site, MOH has worked with the Health Promotion Board and theAgency for Integrated Care to deploy home vaccination teams, comprising adoctor and a nurse, to vaccinate these persons at their homes. Eligiblehomebound persons receiving home medical, nursing or personal care serviceswill be approached by their current home care service provider to ascertaintheir interest in getting vaccinated through this service. If they have notbeen contacted, they can register their interest directly with their currenthome care service provider. Homeboundpersons currently not receiving these home care services can appeal for thisservice by calling the MOH hotline 1800-333-9999. This service is strictlymeant for persons who are homebound. Persons who are not homebound are stronglyencouraged to make an appointment to get vaccinated at any of the vaccinationsites, when vaccination is offered to them. Updated guidancefor use of masksThe use ofmasks continue to be one of the key public health strategies in preventingdisease by reducing the expulsion and transmission of droplets. The recentclusters suggest a higher level of transmission, likely attributed to new virusvariants. Use mask with good filtration capability Includes reusable masks that are made of at least 2 layers of fabric, and surgical masks Check product specifications of single-use masks for their filtration efficiency Use reusable masks such as masks issued by the People’s Association and Temasek Foundation which have good filtration efficiencyMOH and HSA will put up guidelines to aid the public in choosing good masks. Staying home to keep our community safeDuring thisperiod of heightened alert, everyone is strongly encouraged to remain at home,and leave the house only for essential activities. All prevailing safemanagement measures should be adhered to.For moreinformation, click here for MOH’s press release.', 'id': '509ed331-23a6-4953-8a0b-c00a297e863d', 'score': None, 'probability': None, 'question': None, 'meta': {'category': 'articles'}, 'embedding': None},\n",

Read their stories below:“This pandemic has changed our lives drastically and almost everything we do here at PCF Sparkletots. While some semblance of normalcy has been restored with the resumption of physical classes, things are not as they were before.This was one of my motivations to get vaccinated.As the Executive Principal of the preschool centre, I’m in frequent contact with my staff, parents and students. I know that I’ve a social responsibility to protect those around me, especially the children who cannot be vaccinated. All of us have the responsibility to protect those who cannot take the vaccine due to age or certain medical conditions.Even though I was a little apprehensive about taking the COVID-19 vaccine due to my hypertension, my fears were alleviated after I consulted with my doctor. He assured me that the vaccines were safe, which gave me the extra resolve to put my foot forward.If someone tells me that they will ‘wait and see’ before taking the vaccine, I will ask them ‘Why wait and see, when you can take it now to protect yourself and your loved ones?’If you are medically fit, take the COVID-19 vaccine. If not for yourself, do it for your loved ones.”– Kathryn Goy, 54, Executive Principal of PAP Community Foundation (PCF) Sparkletots and Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) Fellow“I’ve always suffered from frequent and chronic coughs. When the first COVID-19 vaccine was approved in Singapore, I had just been discharged from the hospital after recuperating from a lung infection.Even then, I knew that I had to take the vaccine when it was offered to me. As I had existing health problems, my family was very worried about potential long-term side effects, and repeatedly asked me if I was sure about my decision.Although I had some worries at the start, I asked myself, ‘Why am I afraid? I am doing this for my health, and for my family’s health. If I get COVID-19, my family may get it as well. I want to do it for them.’As a healthcare worker, I also wanted to set a good example to show my patients that COVID-19 vaccines are safe. I knew that before I could take care of patients, I had to first take care of myself. When I informed the nurse at the vaccination centre of my medical conditions, she assured me that I was medically fit to take the vaccine.After the vaccination, I only had mild side effects from the second dose which were easily and quickly managed. Having been assured through my experience, my family members also decided to get vaccinated. My husband, who has hypertension, just completed both doses of the vaccine.Protect yourself, and your loved ones. I got my shot, get yours too!”– Mastura Binti Mohamad, 54, Senior Patient Service Associate in Sengkang General Hospital“I really miss interacting freely with passengers and my fellow colleagues. Life has not been the same since. There were many days where I have felt discouraged. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the transport industry tremendously. During Circuit Breaker, our ridership went down quite a bit. We also had to intensify various safety precautions for our passengers, such as disinfecting high-touch points and sanitising our buses twice a day.That’s why I was happy to hear about the COVID-19 vaccines. I believe that the vaccine will protect myself, my loved ones and my passengers.I was one of the first Bus Captains to sign up for the vaccination. I chose to go for the first available slot to instill confidence and encourage my fellow colleagues and union members to do the same. As a frontliner, it is also my duty to protect myself so I can protect the passengers I meet daily.All of us have a role to play in the fight against COVID-19. Even though there is a small chance that a vaccinated person can still get infected, the risk of them falling very sick is greatly reduced!We should all take the vaccination to protect ourselves and those around us!”– Abdul Lathiff Mohamed Rafi, 48, Senior Bus Captain at SBS Transit and Ulu Pandan Bus Depot Union Leader________________________________________________________________________________________#IGotMyShotSG is a campaign that encourages Singaporeans to get their COVID-19 vaccine when it’s available to them.

Everyone should: Avoid going to crowded places, and stay home where possible Limit social gatherings to 2 per day, whether to another household or in a public place Keep groups as small as possible Stick to a regular group of contacts Stay home when unwell, and see a doctor to get tested when sick and be vaccinated when it is offered to youAt the workplace, employers should allow employees to work from home if they are able to. They should continue to stagger start times of employees who need to return, and implement flexible working hours. Social gatherings at the office should also be avoided.The recent community cases are a reminder that the risks of a COVID-19 outbreak remains high. Even as we press ahead with vaccination, we must remain vigilant to avoid a resurgence of cases.For more information, clickherefor MOH's press release.\", 'id': 'cf35ac52-45b2-4fc9-aa71-7018c6cd846d', 'score': None, 'probability': None, 'question': None, 'meta': {'category': 'articles'}, 'embedding': None},\n",

Hear more from Larry Ong, a cancer survivor with multiple drug allergies, and Mohd Isa, a diabetic patient undergoing weekly dialysis. Both Larry and Isa had the go-ahead from their doctors to be vaccinated, after a brief consultation on their medical history. If you are unsure of your COVID-19 vaccination eligibility, remember to consult your doctors or check with the medical staff at your vaccination site!“I was initially rejected for the COVID-19 vaccine. Not because of my medical conditions, but because I’m allergic to 3 drugs – 2 are painkillers (Synflex and Ibuprofen), and the other is a high blood pressure medication (Lisinopril). When I take these drugs, I get a face rash.However, I was still keen to get vaccinated to be protected from COVID-19.I was hoping to be eligible despite taking medication for high blood pressure and high cholesterol for the past 10 years. I also had 2nd stage Thymoma cancer but it is now in remission.With that in mind, I thought that I should go to the vaccination centre to check with the nurse. After I went, they asked me if I had breathlessness when the allergy was triggered. I said no I didn’t, so they said ok, I can go for it.After the jabs, I had some mild side effects – an arm ache for a couple of days. But everything has settled and I feel fine now.No matter if you’re young or old, it’s still better to get vaccinated. We don’t know when this virus will hit us, maybe even from the person closest to you.Let’s protect ourselves, our families and our friends.”– Larry Ong, 68, retiree and cancer-survivor“I’ve had kidney problems since 2017. There was nothing much else the doctor could do. I remember he said, ‘Your kidneys – gone already’. Now I go for dialysis three times a week at the National Kidney Foundation (NKF) centre.I’m also diabetic and I take my insulin medication twice a day - once in the morning, once at night.Despite my medical conditions, I took the second dose of my COVID-19 vaccination about 3 weeks ago. It was ok, just a small pinch when the nurse injected me.Before going, I asked my kidney doctor at the NKF whether I should go. She knows my medical reports and history, and she said, ‘If you feel ok, you should go’.When I was at the vaccination centre, the doctors checked again. They asked me ‘Everything ok, no allergy?’ I went through screening and they said I could take it.Some people talk about getting fever from the vaccine. I tell my friends, ‘Don’t be scared, you can take a Panadol to feel better.’ It’s been good so far, I don’t have much problems.Whenever my friends and I catch up at the kopitiam, we’d say, “since the Government give you free (vaccination), better go!

The video was not filmed on 5 May 2021.Clarifications The video showed travellers from South Asia arriving at Changi Airport Terminal 1, and a clock indicating the time as 14:53 hrs. According to flight records, there were no flights from South Asia (India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka) that arrived at any terminal in Changi Airport between 08:00 hrs and 15:30 hrs on 5 May 2021. In the video, passengers were seen walking past a renovation hoarding at gate hold room D42/43 in Terminal 1. This hoarding had been removed on 5 April 2021, establishing that the video was taken before 5 April 2021.

       " {'text': 'pm lee the covid 19 situation in singapore 14 dec My fellow SingaporeansWe are coming to a full year since our first COVID-19 case.It has been a year of uncertainty, full of ups and downs, filled with anxiety and trepidation.But much has changed within the last few months. In March and April, we peaked at over 1,000 cases a day. Now, on most days we have zero cases of local transmissions. When the pandemic first started, we were worried if there would be enough supplies in the supermarkets. Today, supermarket shelves are full, and shopping is calm and uneventful. Parents were worried then whether their kids should go to school. But we kept the school year intact, CCAs have resumed, and graduating students have finished exams and are waiting for their results. We will not forget the two months of Circuit Breaker in April and May. But today, life is a lot more normal. We go to work, dine out, meet friends, though in groups no more than five.How did we bring things under control? It took a tremendous effort, and some good luck. Our measures were hard for everyone, but they worked. Singaporeans showed resilience and took them in their stride. Our economy took a big hit, but we did not let it crash. Despite the global economic dislocation, most of our workers kept their jobs.Now, our defences against COVID-19 are much stronger. We have steadily built up our testing capacities and procedures. We introduced Rostered Routine Testing of higher risk groups. We started using Antigen Rapid Tests, to resume larger gatherings and events safely. We also beefed up our contact tracing capabilities. For example, expanding our SafeEntry and TraceTogether programmes, and distributing TraceTogether tokens. We got used to the inconvenient restrictions and found ways to carry on with life. We looked after one another, reminding each other to adhere to safe distancing, to wear masks, to see a doctor if ill, and so on.I am very grateful that Singaporeans have complied with the spirit, and not just the letter of the rules. We stayed united, kept up our guard, and did not allow ourselves to become complacent over time. With everyone’s full support, our enhanced safeguards worked, and we could gradually ease our restrictions. We can be proud of how far we have come.Route to Phase 3Because of your efforts, we are now ready to progress to Phase 3. Phase 3 will begin in two weeks’ time, on 28 December, so we will end the year with some good news. The Ministerial Task Force will explain the details immediately after my broadcast. We will ease capacity limits in public places like malls and attractions, and at places of worship. One significant change is to allow groups of up to eight to congregate, up from the current maximum of five. So eight people can dine out together, or visit someone’s home. This will make it easier to hold family get-togethers during the festive period.Please understand that even as we enter Phase 3, the battle is far from won. The COVID-19 virus has not been eradicated. There is a long way to go. Around the world, the pandemic is still raging. Many countries are seeing second, third, or even fourth waves of infection, with record numbers of daily cases.International borders remain largely closed. But trade and travel are our lifeblood. The longer our borders stay closed to travellers, the greater the risk of us permanently losing out as an international hub, consequently hurting our livelihoods.Therefore, our only option is to re-open our borders in a controlled and safe manner. As we do so, we will see more imported cases. And there will be some risk of these cases spreading to the community. We already have had a few cases recently. An airport staff, who likely came into contact with infected passengers. A marine worker, who picked up the virus after boarding ships to do repair and resupply work. This is a calculated risk we have to accept. But the government will take every precaution and do our best to prevent imported cases from triggering a new outbreak.At the same time, Singaporeans must keep our guard up, because the virus is most likely still circulating silently within our community. This is absolutely not the time to relax and let our guard down, or to hold a big party, imagining that the problem has disappeared. Progressing from Phase 2 to Phase 3 is a calibrated, careful move. We are easing the restrictions in a controlled way, so that we can keep the COVID-19 situation stable and take more steps forward later. It is vital that you stay cautious and vigilant, continue to cooperate with the government, and comply with the rules and restrictions that will apply in Phase 3.Update on VaccinationsHow long will we have to keep this up for? It may be for quite a while, possibly a year or more. One key factor is how soon COVID-19 vaccines become available to us.The government has been working quietly behind the scenes, since early in the pandemic, to secure access to vaccines. This was not a simple exercise. More than 200 vaccine candidates were being developed, and not all would succeed.We started talking to the pharmaceutical companies early to understand the science and identify the promising candidates and the vaccines likely to reach production sooner.We have set aside more than $1 billion. We placed multiple bets, to sign advance purchase agreements and make early down-payments for the most promising candidates, including with Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech, and Sinovac. We made arrangements with pharmaceutical companies to facilitate their clinical trials and drug development in Singapore and attracted a few to establish vaccine manufacturing capabilities here. We also supported local efforts to develop a vaccine. This gave our own scientists and researchers the opportunity to do cutting edge work. It was also insurance in case the global supply chain was disrupted. This way, we built up a diversified portfolio of options, to ensure that Singapore would be near the front of the queue for vaccines, and not last in line.Securing early access to vaccines was a whole-of-government effort. Many agencies and public officers, led by the Head of the Civil Service, were involved in this critical mission. I commend them for their good work. They are among the legion of unsung heroes who have helped us get through this crisis.As you would have read the news, the first vaccines are now coming into production. I am very happy to tell you that after studying the scientific evidence and clinical trial data, the Health Sciences Authority has approved the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for pandemic use. The first shipment should arrive by the end of this month, making Singapore one of the first countries to obtain this vaccine. We also expect other vaccines to arrive in Singapore in the coming months. If all goes according to plan, we will have enough vaccines for everyone in Singapore by 3Q2021.MOH has set up a committee of doctors and experts to recommend a vaccination strategy for us. The committee has proposed that the entire adult population should be vaccinated, but to make vaccinations voluntary. First priority will be given to those who are at greatest risk: healthcare workers and frontline personnel, as well as the elderly and vulnerable. Thereafter, the committee proposes to progressively vaccinate the rest of the population, and to cover everyone who wants a vaccination by the end of next year.The Government has accepted these recommendations. I have personal confidence in our experts. My colleagues and I, including the older ones, will be getting ourselves vaccinated early. This is to show you, especially seniors like me, that we believe the vaccines are safe.We have decided to make vaccinations free for all Singaporeans, and for all long-term residents who are currently here. With more of us vaccinated, the harder it will be for the virus to spread, and the safer we will all be as a society.Vaccines will support our recovery in more ways than one. As a global aviation hub, we play a crucial role transporting vaccines around the world. Vaccines require cold chain management. An ordinary refrigerator is not good enough: the Pfizer vaccine needs to be stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius, colder than the Arctic in winter! This requires infrastructure, high standards, skilled personnel, and good connectivity to many different countries and all along the supply chain.Fortunately, Singapore has a strong ecosystem for cargo handling. Leading global logistics companies like DHL, UPS and FedEx are based here. SIA, and Changi Airport’s ground handling partners are certified by IATA (the International Air Transport Association) to handle and transport pharmaceutical supplies. We are now gearing ourselves up to handle large volumes of vaccine shipments into and through Singapore, to help win the global fight against COVID-19.We did not get here overnight. We have always planned ahead, systematically creating opportunities for ourselves. It took us years of investment and planning, building a business-friendly climate and expanding our air links around the world. These long-term investments are now paying dividends.ConclusionDuring this immediate crisis, we have reacted quickly and comprehensively, marshalled resources to solve our problems, and stayed resilient. Our situation is now stable, but only because everyone has worked so hard, and sacrificed so much. Now that vaccines are becoming available, we can see light at the end of the tunnel. As vaccinations become widespread not only in Singapore, but also in our region and the world, we can look forward to resuming more normal lives.Let us keep up our efforts in this final stretch, to cross the finish line together, and complete our mission to defeat COVID-19.Thank you.', 'id': '7a1d4b0a-8bee-4f4a-8721-98640a456ea4', 'score': None, 'probability': None, 'question': None, 'meta': {'category': 'articles'}, 'embedding': None},\n",
       " {'text': 'stepping up to make the campus a greener one Even as a child, Teng Chu Yu was drawn to books about people, flora and fauna in different places and cultures. She fondly reminisces about her family’s weekly library visits – where she would search for both fiction and non-fiction books on these topics.As she entered Secondary school, Chu Yu recalls being captivated throughout her first Geography class. “I had a hunch then, that I’d pursue Geography as a career in the future. And here I am, still on this path,” chuckles the now third year Geography and Global Studies student at the National University of Singapore (NUS).It was in Junior College that Chu Yu developed an interest in pursuing a career related to sustainability in the future. She researched more about the dire state of the global climate and learnt that the effects were escalating in an unequal way across different communities around the world.Plant-intendedHer passion and interest for the environment motivated Chu Yu to opt for a predominantly plant-based diet, and to get involved in a couple of student-led initiatives at NUS. She helped establish a student-led group called the NUS Vision of Equality for a Greener Earth (VEGE). The group aims to introduce the NUS community, as well as members of the public, to the concept of a plant-based diet and lifestyle, for environmental and ethical reasons.Chu Yu(1st row, second from the right) with her teammates from ‘Meat-LiteMovement’Chu Yu saysthat conceptualising and leading the execution of the inaugural ‘Meat-LiteMovement’ was one of her most memorable experiences in VEGE.Under thisproject, Chu Yu and her teammates worked closely with canteen stall owners andother major NUS stakeholders to bring more plant-based options to F&B establishmentsaround the campus. One of the biggest challenges was to talk about plant-based foods to campus F&B outlets with meat-centric food offerings. “It has not been and is still not easy, but I am heartened that the tide may be changing, with more and more plant-based options being launched across Singapore,” she says.Start smallChu Yu notes that you don’t have to make sweeping changes to begin with. “If systematic action seems too daunting for you at the moment, you can begin with simpler steps to become more sustainable”, Chu Yu says. For a start, she advises following social media accounts on Instagram and Telegram that contain bite-sized sustainability-related news. Chu Yu herself has also started two Instagram accounts (@consciouscookieee and @consciousmochiii), where she shares about plant-based food and occasionally social and environmental issues via Instagram stories.These social media content can help us learn more about practising sustainability, both in terms of our individual lifestyles and more systemic action. The latter can involve joining forces with businesses and governmental agencies to collectively progress towards our climate action goals. You can then consider the steps to take and how to consciously become more sustainable. “Actively seek out industry- or sector-specific resources. Find support networks that can sustain you emotionally throughout this journey”, says Chu Yu.Deepening knowledge in sustainability Another undergrad, 24-year-old Tan Shi Zhou, agrees that every little gesture matter. He notes, “Small changes daily can accumulate to create a large impact on the environment. Personally, I take cold showers, avoid using air-conditioning, take public transport and avoid single-use disposables.”The second-year student at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) explains that incorporating these changes to his life might seem small and insignificant, but if everyone does it, it can create a huge impact. Besides majoring in Materials Science and Engineering, Shi Zhou is also doing a minor programme in environmental sustainability. “I hope by learning more about the natural environment, it would reinforce my engineering knowledge in sustainable technologies,” he says.Shi Zhou was previously a Chemical Engineering student at Temasek Polytechnic (TP), where he interned at the water technology department and served as the president in the Green Interest Group. During his National Service days, he also took up a specialist diploma in Environment and Water Technology.Drivingthe campus spirit Shi Zhou is currently the president of Earthlink, a student-led environment club at NTU. He oversaw various sustainability projects, including a call for students to drop off their used pens under a ‘Save that Pen’ initiative, as well as producing a podcast titled “1001 Ways the Earth is Going to Die!”Shi Zhou (second one from the right) and his team members at EarthlinkHowever, when the COVID-19 pandemic hit last year, it became challenging to organise green events. For one, Shi Zhou and his team had to brainstorm ways to execute a two-week long Green For Good 2021 project safely, while keeping it engaging for NTU students and staff to learn more about environmental sustainability. Holding three large events over two weeks in a hybrid mode of virtual and physical setting was challenging for the Earthlink team, but they managed to pull it off successfully. “This couldn’t have happened without my committee members and the school staff who have supported our projects”, Shi Zhou smiles. Singapore Green Plan 2030The Singapore Green Plan 2030 was launched recently as a national movement and whole-of-society effort to build a sustainable Singapore for all generations.As an engineer, Shi Zhou expressed his excitement to how the targets in the Singapore Green Plan could be implemented in Singapore, especially the increase in renewable energy usage and the adoption of electric transportation. Chu Yu also echoed similar sentiments. “I would like to see a more equitable and inclusive transition for former employees from fossil fuel companies, to help them enter clean energy, plant-based protein and other more sustainable sectors.“Given that the Singapore Green Plan 2030 is a ‘living document’, I look forward to seeing how it evolves and addresses pertinent issues.” Share your ideas for the SG Green Plan 2030 at: greenplan.gov.sg/take-action/share-your-ideas/ What you can do Volunteer and participate – get involved with the community here Become a NEA volunteer: nea.gov.sg/programmes-grants/volunteering Practice the 3Rs – reduce, reuse and recycle: Reducing, Reusing, Recycling: 5 fun facts Tips to make your commute a more sustainable one', 'id': 'b2169f5a-5793-4d62-963a-b79028d29bd0', 'score': None, 'probability': None, 'question': None, 'meta': {'category': 'articles'}, 'embedding': None},\n",
       " {'text': 'what you should know about the covid 19 vaccine Singapore received its first batch of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on 21 December. Following that, the recommendations of the Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination on its vaccination strategy for Singapore were accepted by the Government. Among its recommendations: The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine has been reviewed and endorsed for use in Singapore for individuals aged 16 and above. [Updated 3 Feb 2021] The Moderna COVID-19 vaccine has been authorised for use in Singapore. Details here. Vaccination will take place progressively, with priority given to: (i) Persons at high risk of being infected by COVID-19, including healthcare and frontline workers(ii) Persons most vulnerable to severe disease and complications if they fall ill with COVID-19. This includes the elderly and persons with medical comorbidities (those with 2 or more illnesses/diseases at the same time)Vaccinations for healthcare workers started on 30 Dec 2020, while vaccinations for the elderly (starting with those aged 70 and above) will begin from Feb 2021. Comprehensive vaccination coverage will not only protect our population, but also those who cannot be vaccinated due to medical reasons. While vaccination is encouraged, it is voluntary. To help you make a more informed decision on whether you want to be vaccinated, here are some key questions, answered.A. Why is vaccination important?Vaccination is one of the key strategies to protect us and our loved ones against COVID-19, along with safe management measures, contact tracing and testing. The Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination proposed to vaccinate the population as widely as possible to not only reduce the number of people susceptible to the disease but also the chances of transmission. As more of us are vaccinated, the harder it will be for the virus to spread, and the safer we will all be as a society.A comprehensive vaccination coverage will then enable us to re-open further, allow more social activities to resume, and facilitate the recovery of our economy. However, until a significant proportion of the population is vaccinated, Singaporeans must continue to observe safe management measures. B. How do the COVID-19 vaccines work?Vaccines work with your body’s natural defenses to protect you from diseases. When you get a vaccine, your immune system is trained to recognise the virus and produces antibodies. These antibodies attack the viruses and stay in our bodies. Of the three vaccines that Singapore had signed Advance Purchase Agreements with – Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Sinovac – the first two are messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines, while the last uses an inactivated vaccine technology. mRNA vaccines contain material from the COVID-19 virus that gives our cells instructions on how to make a harmless protein that is unique to the virus. After our cells make copies of the protein, they destroy the genetic material from the vaccine. Our bodies then recognise that the protein should not be there and build antibodies to fight the virus. Inactivated vaccine technology uses weakened or inactive viral particles to stimulate our body to produce an immune response to the COVID-19 virus.Some vaccines require multiple doses, given weeks or months apart. This allows us to produce long-lived antibodies and develop memory cells – so that our bodies can rapidly fight the virus should we be exposed to it again.

Are COVID-19 vaccines safe, especially for the elderly and those who are vulnerable? The safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines for all Singaporeans is of utmost importance. Only vaccines that comply with the World Health Organisation’s guidelines and meet strict standards of safety, quality and efficacy will be used for our population. Multiple safety checks are in place before the vaccines are rolled-out in Singapore. For example, all vaccines to be deployed in Singapore must be authorised by the Health Sciences Authority. An expert panel, comprising 18 scientists and clinicians, was also formed to advise the Government on therapeutics and vaccines. In identifying suitable vaccines, the panel relies on data that comes from the different vaccine companies at their respective stages of clinical trials. Read more about the processes put in place here.D. How was the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine evaluated?In assessing the suitability of vaccine candidates, the Expert Committee took into consideration vaccine safety and efficacy, vaccine tolerability, as well as data adequacy of clinical trials.The Health Sciences Authority authorised the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, based on the following assessment: It has a high vaccine efficacy of 95% in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 disease in vaccinated persons aged 16 years and older. Its safety profile is consistent with other established and registered vaccines. No significant safety concerns have been detected. Common side effects were expected as part of the body’s natural response to a vaccination, such as injection site pain, fever, fatigue and headache. The benefits outweigh the known risks. But continued monitoring for longer-term efficacy of the vaccine, as well as monitoring for rare and serious adverse events will be needed. Until more information is available, pregnant women and those under 16 years old should not receive the vaccine. It is also not recommended at this stage for immunocompromised individuals.E. Are there side-effects?Some people may experience side-effects such as fever, redness and swelling at the injection site. These are common side-effects and expected as part of the body’s natural response towards build immunity against COVID-19. Hear what Prof Benjamin Seet has to say about the thorough review process for safety and tolerability. F. Who should take the vaccine?COVID-19 vaccination may be voluntary, but the Government strongly encourages all who are medically eligible to be vaccinated when it is offered to you. When more of us are vaccinated, the harder it will be for the virus to spread, and the safer we will be as a society. Priority will be given to those at greater risk of infection, such as healthcare and COVID-19 frontline workers, as well as vulnerable groups, including seniors. Pregnant women, people with compromised immune systems and those under 16 years old should not receive the vaccine yet, until more data is available. G. How much does it cost to be vaccinated? All Singaporeans and long-term residents in Singapore will be able to be vaccinated for free. Migrant workers will also be offered the vaccine, with more details to be announced.', 'id': '835b8be7-8282-4e1b-b990-845f3498050b', 'score': None, 'probability': None, 'question': None, 'meta': {'category': 'articles'}, 'embedding': None},\n",

       " {'text': 'experts explain covid 19 vaccines Singapore’s COVID-19 vaccination programme is underway and you are encouraged to get vaccinated when it is offered to you.But some may be concerned about side effects, allergic reactions and even the safety of the vaccine.Prof Tan Chorh Chuan, Singapore’s Chief Health Scientist and member of the Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination, has the facts.Why should I be vaccinated?Prof Tan: Vaccination will protect each of us, at the same time, it will help protect our loved ones. The more people get vaccinated, the lower the risk of big outbreaks from occurring and this in turn will protect those who are not recommended now for vaccination. These include people who are less than 16 years old, those who are pregnant and those with severe immuno-compromised conditions.Vaccination also allows us to resume social activities much more quickly and to further reopen our economy.What are the vaccine’s side effects?Prof Tan: When I had my vaccination, the actual injection was painless because the needle was very fine. Then, on the same day I had some soreness in the arm which had the vaccine, and then the next day I had some headache. But now, I feel perfectly well.For most of us who are going for vaccination, we should expect some mild side effects, usually pain and soreness in the arm, a bit of tiredness, headache. Some people get fever. But usually they just last for one, two or three days.One of the things we look out for is severe allergic reactions. This is rare. In the vaccine rollout that has occurred around the UK and US, about eleven per one million people might get severe allergic side effects. But besides that, the rates of serious side effects is very, very low. Individuals who are vaccinated are monitored for half an hour at the vaccination site. The vaccination site has all the facilities and medications ready to deal with a severe allergic reaction and the staff are trained to react very quickly so as to minimise the risk. Will the vaccine protect against new virus strains?Prof Tan: So, both Pfizer and Moderna have come forward to say that their vaccines continue to be effective against the variants that have been seen in the UK. We are continuing to monitor this very carefully, as additional studies are being done and as more data comes out in the coming weeks. Is the vaccine safe?Prof Tan: The vaccines that have been approved are safe. There are three important points to bear in mind.(i) The first is the rapid speed in which the vaccines were developed for COVID-19 occurred because of very major advances in the science, in the manufacturing, as well as the huge amounts of funding that were put in to support vaccine development by governments, by industry and by not-for-profit organisations. So the process is much faster, but the standards that are being applied to the process, to the evaluation is kept very high, if not higher.(ii) The second point to note is that, there are regulatory agencies such as the Health Sciences Authority in Singapore that look very carefully at the data for each vaccine. They apply high international standards to review the safety, the quality and the effectiveness of every vaccine.(iii) We also have an expert committee on COVID-19 vaccination that also looks at the safety and effectiveness data of the different vaccines for rollout in Singapore.Can I choose my vaccine?Prof Tan: Any vaccines approved for use in Singapore would have met high safety standards, quality standards, and effectiveness standards. So when you are invited to come forward for vaccination, you shouldn’t have to worry about choosing which particular vaccine you will be receiving.But we should also know that the different vaccines have different logistical requirements, so it would make it very complicated if individuals were to choose which vaccines they want. The whole vaccination process is already very complicated, and adding that additional element would make it even more difficult to roll out efficiently and quickly. With safe management measures in place, is vaccination necessary?Prof Tan: It is very important that even after vaccination, that we continue to wear a mask, and continue to adhere to safe distancing measures. This is because the vaccination roll out will take some time, and during that period, there will be many in Singapore who are still not protected, and they will be susceptible to infection should an outbreak occur.When can I get my vaccination?Prof Tan: Vaccination will be rolled out progressively, but initially because supplies will be limited, there will have to be prioritisation, and the priority groups will be healthcare workers, people who are frontline responders, as well as those people in essential services, and then seniors.When your turn comes, MOH will notify you to come forward for vaccination.

In particular, there are allegations that a doctor had suffered a stroke and an 81-year-old man had passed away from heart attack as a consequence and result of receiving the COVID-19 vaccination. These allegations are false.We also note that there are third parties who have exploited the sharing of personal experiences by individuals, by reposting these personal accounts and making unsubstantiated claims about vaccine-related adverse reactions. They often continue to do so despite the original posts being removed or made private.FactsAs of 14 April 2021, there is no credible evidence for an increased risk of heart attack or stroke with the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines which are currently approved and offered in Singapore.The medical team caring for the doctor has assessed that the doctor’s current condition is highly unlikely to be related to the COVID-19 vaccination, and Mount Elizabeth Hospital had issued a clarification on 4 April 2021.The cause of death of the 81-year-old man was ischaemic heart disease (lack of blood circulation to the heart muscles). The Health Sciences Authority (HSA) Forensic Medicine Division has reported that based on post-mortem, there was no evidence of acute anaphylaxis or an allergic reaction at the injection site of the COVID-19 vaccine. There was extensive narrowing of the 3 main blood vessels supplying blood to the muscles of the heart due to atherosclerosis (build up of plaques over time in the blood vessels that obstruct blood flow).COVID-19 vaccines that are used in Singapore have been assessed to be safe and efficacious by both the HSA and the Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination. Medical teams are well-equipped and measures are in place at all vaccination sites to ensure the safety of vaccine recipients pre-, during, and post-vaccination. All vaccine-related incidents are taken seriously and healthcare professionals are required to report these incidents expediently to the Ministry of Health and HSA.Additional ClarificationsThe Vaccine Injury Financial Assistance Programme for COVID-19 Vaccination (VIFAP) provides one-time goodwill financial assistance to persons who experience serious side effects that are assessed to be related to COVID-19 vaccine administered in Singapore. To apply for VIFAP, individuals will need to submit an application accompanied by medical information on the serious side effect from their treating doctor. As the severity of serious side effects can be broad-ranging and the clinical assessment by doctors may vary, all VIFAP applications will be assessed and adjudicated by a MOH-appointed independent clinical panel comprising experts in relevant fields such as neurology, immunology, and infectious diseases. The VIFAP is not meant to reimburse medical costs. It provides an additional layer on financial support, on top of the existing government healthcare financing schemes for medical costs incurred, which include government subsidies, MediShield Life, MediSave, and MediFund. If you require assistance with your medical bill, please contact the social worker at your healthcare institution.We advise members of the public not to speculate and/or spread unfounded rumors.

What is pre-event testing?Pre-event testing requires participants of selected events or activities to be tested at the venue, a dedicated testing facility or clinic no more than 24 hours before the end of their participation at the event. Only participants who present a valid negative COVID-19 test result will be allowed to attend the event. These pilots have allowed MOH to assess the operational workflows for further implementation of pre-event testing, as well as gauge the feasibility of allowing more events to be scaled up gradually. Scaling up of selected activitiesWith the success of the pilots, here are the activities that will be allowed to scale up gradually from 24 April 2021: Activities Details Marriage solemnisations Limit increased from 100 to 250 attendees (including the wedding couple, excluding the Licensed Solemniser and vendors) Attendees must be organised in zones of up to 50 each Pre-event testing will only be required for the wedding couple at solemnisation-only events of more than 100 attendees Wedding receptions Limit increased from 100 to 250 attendees (including the wedding couple, excluding vendors) Attendees must be organised in zones of up to 50 each Pre-event testing required for ALL attendees (including wedding couple) at events of more than 100 attendees Live performances Limit increased to 750 attendees with pre-event testing implemented Limit of 250 attendees with no pre-event testing implemented Business-to-business events(i.e. meetings, conferences & exhibitions) Limit increased to 750 attendees with pre-event testing implemented Limit of 250 attendees with no pre-event testing implemented Attendees must be organised in zones of up to 50 each Sports events Limit increased to 750 spectators with pre-event testing implemented Limit of 250 spectators with no pre-event testing implemented Wakes and funerals Limit increased from 30 to 50 attendees at any one time on the day of the burial/creation only Limit for other days will remain at 30 attendees at any one time Attending large-scale events for vaccinated individuals From 24 April 2021, individuals who have completed the full vaccination regimen and have had time to develop sufficient protection (i.e. two weeks after the second dose of the Pfizer or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine) can gain entry to events that have implemented pre-event testing without the need to undergo pre-event testing.

       " {'text': \"experts explain covid 19 and safe management measures Curious how a swab test feels like, or wondered why we should still keep our social circles small even though safe distancing is not required on public transport?While some safe management measures may seem curious when compared to others, rest assured there is always a good reason behind each one.Hear the explanations straight from our three experts: Dr Janil Puthucheary, Senior Minister of State, Ministry of Communications and Information & Ministry of Health; Dr Koh Poh Koon, Senior Minister of State, Ministry of Health; and Assoc Prof Vernon Lee, Director (Communicable Diseases) at the Ministry of Health. 1.Is the swab test painful and must I pay for it?Dr Koh: If you're having symptoms like the flu and your doctor recommends you go for a swab test, you can have it done for free, at the Public Health Preparedness Clinics (PHPCs), the regional screening centres, and all government polyclinics.It's a simple swab test through the nose and takes less than 10 seconds - I've done it twice in the last two weeks. The swabs are actually much thinner than a cotton bud that you normally use and only goes in slightly more than where your fingers normally can reach. The only discomfort you feel would be the urge to sneeze. But before you can even sneeze, the test is done. So, do not be afraid to go for the swab test if your doctor recommends it.2.Can I lower my mask when sipping my drink while walking?Dr Janil: Well, I don't know how you can drink with a mask still on - you have to lower it to drink. But of course, put it back on again when you're done. More importantly, if it’s bubble tea, ask for less sugar, please. 3.Why should my colleagues and I stagger our lunch times when we share the same office space?Prof Vernon: There's a big difference between spending time in the office and going for lunch. In the office, most of the time, our masks are on and we are able to maintain good physical distance.Now, when we are dining with our colleagues, our masks are off most of the time. We are in much closer physical proximity, and we also tend to talk quite loudly in a social environment. So, it is very important then that we limit the number of colleagues that we go out for lunch with.It is also important for us to stagger our meal times, so that we can avoid overcrowding in our lunch venues.4.Are young children considered as pax when dining out?Prof Vernon: This is not quite like going to attractions, where young children can get in for free. Unfortunately with COVID-19, babies and young children are also susceptible to infection. That means that every individual must be counted towards the total number of people in a certain venue. 5.Why must we wear our masks when dining out with our family?Prof Vernon: So, can you imagine if you're drinking a cup of coffee, and someone walks past you and coughs or sneezes at you without a mask on, that would be extremely gross.Therefore, if you're not eating or drinking, please put on a mask to protect yourself and to also protect others.6.Why are only small groups allowed in makan places?Dr Koh: The virus spreads most effectively when the three V's coincide. What are they? Vocalisation - which is about talking, singing without your mask on, and spreading aerosols and droplets into the air. Volume of interaction - when people come close together and spend a long time together talking to one another. Venue - the type of settings where people come together, places like restaurants, pubs, nightclubs, where people interact in close proximity.So, when the three V's come together - it is a super spreader event, and the virus can spread very effectively. That's why we recommend that in a restaurant setting, the group size should be kept small and you should sit further apart. You should put on your mask when you finish eating, so that you keep yourself and others safe.7.Why must I keep my social circle small, when I squeeze with many others on public transport?Prof Vernon: There are several differences between taking public transportation and interacting with our close family and friends in our social circle.In our social circles, as we eat and drink, there are many times when the masks are off, when we are talking loudly and have very close interactions. These provide the opportunity for respiratory droplets to transmit COVID-19 to one another. Public transportation, on the other hand, is quite different. Although sometimes you're not able to maintain safe distancing, wearing a mask and refraining from talking will prevent the explosion of respiratory droplets.Also, when you leave the MRT or bus, please sanitise your hands to keep your hands clean. If we do all this, we would actually reduce the risk of COVID-19 spread to a very low level.The other thing that we all must remember to do is to use our TraceTogether App, or to carry the Token. This helps us to contact trace any COVID-19 case that might occur. 8.Can we stop wearing a mask if we practise social distancing?Prof Vernon: So, wearing a mask is actually one of the most important tools that prevent the spread of COVID-19.When we talk very loudly, or cough and sneeze, what happens is that respiratory droplets spread far and wide. The larger droplets may actually spread for about 0.4 metres before they drop to the ground, but very fine droplets might travel between one to two metres and linger around in the air for up to a minute. We put on a mask to prevent ourselves from getting infected by these droplets, and to prevent us from spreading disease to others. 9.If walking is my exercise, can I not wear a mask?Dr Koh: The rule is that once we get out of the house, we should put on the mask. Treat it as part of your wardrobe, because it protects you and protects others as well. If you're walking very briskly, and you start to feel breathless, it is probably alright to take the mask off for a short period of time. Once you feel comfortable, you should put it back on, to maintain the protection.Some seniors find that it's quite difficult to do strenuous exercises, and sometimes when they go out for a stroll or walk, they tend to feel breathless. In that case, for their own safety, it's probably alright to let the mask off for a little while. But remember, the protection must be on at all times If you're not feeling breathless. 11.Why must the SafeEntry and TraceTogether App/Token be used together?Dr Janil: Well, SafeEntry with the QR codes is about where we have been.TraceTogether is very different. It uses Bluetooth to check our proximity to other people. It's really about who we’re putting at risk when we’re sick. It's about protecting our loved ones. So, we need both to keep us all safe together.12.Why is the Stay-Home Notice duration different for some travellers?Dr Janil: There are three different ways in which we protect ourselves here in Singapore. For travellers from highest risk countries, they will be served a 14 day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) or quarantine because their risk is much higher than here in Singapore. For those from countries where things are improving, they serve a seven-day SHN, with COVID-19 swabs, of course. For other places, where their numbers are pretty much the same as ours, or even lower, the risk is low, about the same as going from Jurong to Punggol. So, we just ask them to do a COVID-19 swab test when they arrive in Singapore.This article is part of our #WhyAh series that explores the “Why’s” behind our COVID-19 safe management measures.\", 'id': '3c4b7796-17cc-49f8-bcb0-f34bf3e3bc85', 'score': None, 'probability': None, 'question': None, 'meta': {'category': 'articles'}, 'embedding': None},\n",

Continued Adherence to Safe Management MeasuresThere has been a resurgence of COVID-19 in other countries as they open up to more activities or due to lack of adherence to safe management measures. To ensure that the situation in Singapore remains under control, we will have to keep up the habits and practices of the past few months. Small group sizes Limits on group sizes will continue, both in public spaces and visitors to the home. Safe distancing Requirements on safe distancing will continue to disallow or minimise interactions between groups. Social responsibility Mask-wearing and personal hygiene protect us and others from COVID-19. Those with symptoms of acute respiratory infection should seek medical attention at the earliest opportunity and follow up with a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) swab test if instructed by the doctor. 2. Pre-event TestingTo allow more activities to resume safely, the Multi-Ministry Taskforce (MMTF) is piloting the use of pre-event testing for larger-scale and higher-risk activities.Due to the need for a shorter turnaround, the use of antigen rapid tests is being explored for pre-event testing. With its lower sensitivity compared to the PCR test, safe management measures including mask-wearing and safe distancing will still be in place.From mid-October to December 2020, pre-event testing will take place at wedding receptions, live performances and sports events, among others. Feedback from the events will be used to finetune processes, and the Ministry of Health (MOH) will assess which can be implemented more widely. 3. Expansion of Digital Contact Tracing ToolsWhile the use of SafeEntry has strengthened the ability to detect COVID-19 clusters quickly, greater participation in the TraceTogether Programme is required to help identify close contacts of COVID-19 positive cases.Consequently, a higher take-up rate for TraceTogether is needed before Phase Three can begin. This will enable MOH to quickly contact trace and ringfence any infections.TraceTogether-only Safe Entry, where visitors are required to either scan the QR code using the TraceTogether App or present the TraceTogether Token, must also be expanded.This will ensure that persons visiting places where people are likely to be in contact for prolonged periods, or where human traffic is high, have either the TraceTogether App or Token. TraceTogether-only Safe Entry will be gradually introduced at workplaces, schools and public venues such as cinemas.TraceTogether tokens are available for collection at 38 Community Centres/ Clubs (CCs), and are expected to be available at all 108 CCs by end-November 2020. Head down to the TokenGoWhere website to locate a convenient site for collection. Moving to Phase ThreeWith these enablers in place and everyone’s cooperation, we will be able to move to Phase Three. However, the exact timing of these changes will depend on our collective ability to cooperate with the requirements.1. Increasing Group SizeIn Phase Three, the group size for gatherings outside the home and number of visitors allowed to homes could be increased from the present 5 persons to 8 persons.2.Increasing Capacity LimitsPublic venues such as museums are currently open but subject to a capacity limit, while events like wedding receptions can be held in two zones of 50 persons. In Phase Three, these capacity limits could be increased, with events having multiple zones of 50 persons.These adjustments will have to be done in a controlled way and additional measures would apply for specific settings. For example, wedding receptions are higher-risk activities, where many people are gathered for a meal. Any expansion in the number of attendees would require additional safety measures, including a pre-event test. 3.Considerations for Activities in Higher-Risk SettingsHigher-risk settings like bars, pubs, karaoke lounges and nightclubs are closed as their activities pose a higher risk of transmission. Though these activities are unlikely to resume at the start of Phase Three, the MMTF is considering a few limited pilots with a more stringent set of measures to explore how the industry could resume safely. Where there is non-resumption, the Government will put in place an assistance package to help business operators transit to new areas.4.Facilitating travel and re-opening of bordersAs a key international and travel hub, Singapore cannot keep our borders closed and needs to gradually allow more travel to resume safely.Presently, travelers from low-risk countries/ regions are allowed to enter Singapore with a COVID-19 test instead of a Stay-Home Notice (SHN), while those from higher-risk countries/ regions are required to serve a SHN at home or at dedicated facilities. The MMTF is exploring ways to deploy more frequent testing to allow more travelers to safely enter Singapore without serving a SHN.In line with the progressive move to reopen our borders, all Singaporeans, Permanent Residents and Long-Term Pass Holders will now be allowed to access government subsidies and insurance coverage for their medical bills.Road to Phase Three and BeyondEven as these adjustments are made, the MMTF will also continue to explore vaccines, treatment, testing and other technologies which could enable us to further ease restrictions and resume travel safely.Read more:', 'id': '62ae9fd2-bd4a-41a3-8df8-7cac5e912d07', 'score': None, 'probability': None, 'question': None, 'meta': {'category': 'articles'}, 'embedding': None},\n",
       " {'text': 'how singapore is ensuring access to covid 19 vaccines Singapore became the first nation in Asia to receive doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on 21 December 2020, thanks to a coordinated approach between the Government, the scientific community and industry partners. Soon after the COVID-19 outbreak began, the wheels in Singapore’s efforts to secure vaccines began turning as the Government began closely monitoring the global development of vaccines. An early startIn April 2020, a Therapeutics and Vaccines expert panel (TxVax panel) was formed to source for vaccine candidates around the world. The panel, comprising 18 scientists and clinicians across hospitals, A*STAR and the private sector, conducted an extensive study of 35 promising candidates to screen them for safety and efficacy. The TxVax panel relies on data that comes from the different vaccine companies at their respective stages of clinical trials. The clinical trial process, which involves testing an experimental drug or vaccine, has three phases. The first two phases are typically carried out among smaller groups to test the vaccine’s safety and efficacy. Researchers assess how the human immune system is responding to the vaccine and monitor for possible side effects. Trials in the third phase are significantly larger, often involving thousands of people across multiple countries. This phase determines if the vaccine can protect users from the infection. As more data was released across the different stages of the trials, the TxVax panel updated and refined their assessments, and passed their recommendations to a group of planners.Diversifying vaccine options Given the lack of certainty over which vaccine would succeed, the planning group diversified the choices across different vaccine technology platforms. The Economic Development Board (EDB) also weighed in on the criteria for choosing the vaccines. “The 35 (vaccine candidates) that we looked at very seriously, we had already pre-screened, based on certain characteristics like the technology type, who is developing it, the track record and the timeline of development,” said Ms. Lisa Ooi, EDB’s Vice President of Healthcare and Wellness Strategy. Given the variety of vaccines types, there needed to be a “balance between established options and fastest to the market”, Ms. Ooi added. Assessment and monitoring of the vaccinesOver the months, the planning group made careful assessments of the different vaccines before deciding which to purchase. Vaccines from Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech and Sinovac have been purchased, and there are ongoing efforts to procure others to ensure a diversified range of options. As the Ministry of Health negotiated the commercial agreements, the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) reviewed the clinical trial data to guide Singapore’s vaccine review process. COVID-19 vaccines approved for use, such as the Pfizer-BioNTech one, have gone through a thorough review for safety. Professor Benjamin Seet, Deputy Group CEO (Education & Research) at the National Healthcare Group explained more about the process.“While mRNA vaccines (such as the Pfizer-BioNTech one) are new and there are some uncertainties, when you look at the clinical trials as well as the scientific review, it is very rigorous.” As the drug is used in Singapore, companies will continue to work with HSA to monitor any side effects. Ensuring early access The planning group collaborated with the vaccine producers to ensure that delivery schedules were met, even roping in our national carrier, Singapore Airlines, so that there were flights from airports near where the vaccines were produced. When the vaccines arrive in Singapore, they will be kept in cold chain facilities, where they can be stored for months. Following that, the vaccines will be transported to the sites where they will be administered. There are also ongoing efforts to establish vaccine production facilities in Singapore. Thermo Fisher Scientific, one of the world’s largest life sciences company, recently announced that it would establish a new US$130m facility in Singapore in 2022. Several other companies are also in the final stages of talks to invest in new vaccine production plants here. Made possible by a strong partnership Singapore is one of the first countries to obtain the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. The 11 months it took from when the virus first arrived in Singapore to when we received our first shipment of vaccines on 21 December 2020 was no fluke. It was due to the team of public officers, scientists and industry partners who worked tirelessly behind the scenes to make early access to vaccines possible. The road to vaccine procurement was fraught with uncertainty but with the shipment now on our shores, Singapore is now ready to roll-out its vaccination plan for our residents.*Photo (used in banner image) by the Ministry of Communications and Information', 'id': '72449345-c9e4-4e8e-95d7-8ef7a30bddf5', 'score': None, 'probability': None, 'question': None, 'meta': {'category': 'articles'}, 'embedding': None},\n",
       " {'text': 'i got my shot to stay healthy and active Still on the fence about whether it is safe for you to get The Jab? No need to fret – at least not according to Mr Teo Khee Huat and Mdm Chue Khuan Hou, both Singaporeans who received their COVID-19 vaccinations, despite suffering from underlying health conditions.For Mr Teo and Mdm Chue, getting vaccinated means that they can stay healthy and active for themselves and their loved ones. As Mr Teo shared: “Early prevention is better than cure!”“I started experiencing health issues in 2008 when I found occasional blood clots in the stools. I went to the polyclinic, thinking it was piles. But they ended up finding a 2.5cm tumour in my colon, that I soon learnt was cancerous.A biopsy also found that I had a rare skin cancer. It was very early stage cancer, so thankfully, I didn’t have to go through chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Through surgery, the doctors managed to remove the tumour in my colon.When I was offered the COVID-19 vaccine, I said, ‘Sure, why not!’. The cancer was in remission so there were no issues taking the vaccine.I’ve also been taking blood thinning medications for Chronic Venous Insufficiency, enlarged prostate glands and an irregular heartbeat. To make sure I could take the vaccines, I checked with the doctor at the vaccination centre, who gave me the go-ahead to do so.The morning after my first jab, I felt well enough to go for my 3km brisk walk. I didn’t experience any issues with my second jab too.My friends ask me if I’ve done my jab. Some say they prefer to wait and see. I assured one of them, ‘You are only 80 years old! My jogging kakis are 86 and 90 and they went through the jab with no issues! We are living examples.’We always say that early diagnosis is the best treatment for cancer. The chance of recovery is higher. Likewise, for COVID-19 - if there is a way to prevent it, why not?\"–Teo Khee Huat, 78, colorectal and skin cancer survivor, Chairperson of the Singapore Cancer Society SemiColon Support Group “I’ve had high cholesterol for about 10 years. I also went for an angioplasty (ballooning) before – for blocked arteries. Because of my heart condition, before I went for the vaccination, I checked with the doctor at the polyclinic to ask if it was suitable for me. He assured me that it is suitable, and encouraged me to go for it. With that, I asked my daughter to help me to register for the vaccination.I did my injections at the Community Club. The wait took about 5 to 10 minutes, and then after taking the jab, I waited half an hour to make sure everything was ok. I didn’t have noticeable side effects after the jabs.Vaccination is important because I want to continue to be active. Every morning, I do a little exercise, then I go to the market to get food and groceries. I also want to be healthy enough to look after my 11-month-old grandson.Because of my medical conditions, I think it’s even more important that I take the COVID-19 vaccination. I want to protect myself.”–MdmChue Khuan Hou, 65, a grandma who has taken both doses of her COVID-19 vaccine despite suffering from a heartcondition and high cholesterol________________________________________________________________________________________#IGotMyShotSG is a campaign that encourages Singaporeans to get their COVID-19 vaccine when it’s available to them.

       " {'text': 'how to keep safe during weddings and solemnisations Weddings are certainly a cause for joy and celebration. But planning for one during Phase 3 of Singapore’s re-opening during this COVID-19 period can be more complicated. Besides keeping to venue capacity limits, it is important for wedding organisers, venue operators, the bride, groom and their guests, to keep to Safe Management Measures (SMMs). Here’s how you can keep safe during weddings. 1. Make sure you are wellFor the sake of the bride, groom, and all the other guests, make sure you are not ill before attending the solemnisation or wedding. If you are feeling sick, see a doctor and stay home. Ask the couple if there are options to attend the wedding virtually. 2. Facilitate contact tracingAll wedding attendees must use TraceTogether and SafeEntry to help with contact tracing. Temperatures of all attendees should be taken before entry into the event.In addition, the couple should inform the licensed solemniser of the names of all attendees and vendors engaged. Attendance records need to be kept for 14 days after the solemnisation. 3. Adhere to capacity limitsIf the wedding is held in a home, keep to a maximum of 8 visitors. This excludes the solemniser, vendors and members of the host household. Do note that if the event is being held in a home, you can only hold solemnisations and not a reception (with food and beverage). You could consider having a separate reception at venues where proper SMMs can be observed. For weddings held at an external venue, including places of worship, you can have a maximum of 100 guests. The guests will need to be split into:- 2 zones of up to 50 pax each, OR- Staggered timeslots of up to 50 pax per time slot, with 30 minutes between each session.4. Distance between groups must be at least 1m apartBesides a designated core of 20 persons (including the bride, groom and witnesses), the rest of the guests will need to keep to groups of up to 8 pax. The groups need to keep at least 1m apart at all times. 5. Follow fixed seating and keep to your zonesGuests will need to be assigned seats and food should be served to them. Buffets are not allowed. This also means that other freestanding activities such as photobooths are not allowed.6. Mask upThe bride and groom must use a mask or face shield throughout the solemnisation. However, they can remove it for key moments, including the exchanging of vows and rings, to kiss and during the wedding march-ins and outs. During these moments, the couple needs to maintain a 2m distance from the rest of the guests.All other attendees must keep their mask on throughout, except for when they are eating or drinking. They may remove their masks momentarily for photos. All wedding organisers, venue operators & couples must adhere to SMMs.Enforcement action will be taken against errant operators and individuals. This includes fines, suspension of operations and prosecution. Wedding venue “The Orange Ballroom” at Tanjong Katong Complex was ordered to close for 20 days for allowing a couple to host three wedding receptions involving 275 persons on 30 Jan 2021.

Within the community, a few cases of infection have been identified amongst recovered workers at the Westlite Woodlands Dormitory. The Multi-Ministry Taskforce has been monitoring the situation closely and has convened special COVID-19 testing operations for all workers at the dormitory. Restricting travel from IndiaWhile no evidence suggests that the recent cases at Westlite Woodlands Dormitory are linked to the new COVID-19 strain in India, border measures with India will be tightened in light of the worsening COVID-19 situation in India.The following measures will be implemented with immediate effect: All travellers with recent travel history to India who have yet to complete their 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) by 22 April 2021, 11.59pm, will need to complete an additional 7-day SHN at dedicated SHN facilities, instead of their place of residence. These individuals will also have to undergo Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) tests on-arrival, on Day 14 of their SHN, and another test before the end of their 21-day SHN period. From 23 April 2021, 11.59pm, until further notice, all long-term pass holders and short-term visitors with recent travel history (including transit) to India within the last 14 days will not be allowed entry or transit through Singapore. This also applies to all who had obtained prior approval for entry into Singapore. Additional precautions for recovered personsIn consultation with infectious disease specialists, the Ministry of Health (MOH) and Ministry of Manpower have reviewed scientific evidence from a cohort of recovered persons in Singapore, and found evidence that suggests a possible decrease in antibody levels of individuals that have recovered from COVID-19. As such, caution is required around the infection risks of recovered persons.With effect from 29 April 2021: Recovered dormitory dwelling workers and Construction, Marine and Process workers living in Singapore who have crossed 270 days from the date of COVID-19 infection, will no longer be exempted from prevailing public health measures. These individuals will be enrolled back on Rostered Routine Testing (RRT) once they have passed 270 days from the date of past infection. If they are identified as close contacts of COVID-19 positive cases, they will be subjected to quarantine immediately. Newly arrived migrant workers with a serology positive result will also be enrolled onto 14-day RRT.Singapore will closely monitor cases of reinfection and review border measures for recovered travellers. Imported cases suspected of re-infection will be isolated and will have to undergo repeated COVID-19 PCR tests, for monitoring, and to ensure that such cases are detected promptly. MOH will also continue to review data and evidence of any new viral strains, and update Singapore’s public health measures accordingly.For more information, click here for MOH's press release.\", 'id': 'e4f87b39-f096-473a-84b8-62a596464be9', 'score': None, 'probability': None, 'question': None, 'meta': {'category': 'articles'}, 'embedding': None},\n",

Here’s a summary of his speech:1.Singapore’s response to COVID-19 We flattened the curve through:a.Contact tracing and testing capabilities b.Expansion of healthcare systemc.Mobilising SAF and Home Team to assist in testing and ensuring well-being of migrant workersd.Implementing circuit breaker in April 2020Singapore has done well in terms of health outcomes – low fatality rate, declining new infection rate, fewer than 100 patients in hospital.Singapore’s COVID-19 response was not without shortcomings, as the virus has severely tested every government in the world. Some things the government might have done differently:a.Discovering people with COVID-19 were infectious when asymptomaticb.Quarantine of all returning overseas Singaporeans, instead of only those returning from certain countries c.Testing all of them before releasing from quarantine, even when they don’t show symptoms d.Requiring the wearing of face masks soonerOverall, Singapore has been able to deal with COVID-19 only because the public service, the political leadership, our businesses, and the Singapore public have worked closely together, each doing their part. We must never let our guard down even as the current situation stabilises2.Social Safety Nets-To protect the vulnerable in our society and ensure that everyone has full access to opportunities to improve their lives-Extensive social safety nets were not needed in early decades of nationhood as Singapore was rapidly growing and the social infrastructure then was adequate for the pace of living-As our economy matures, we have progressively strengthened our social safety nets through introducing many schemes in these 15 years eg. ComCare, Workfare, Silver Support-These peacetime measures were insufficient during the COVID-19 outbreak – new emergency measures eg. Jobs Support Scheme, COVID-19 Support Grant were implemented -Identify pragmatic solutions to make best use of Singapore’s resources to meet the needs of different groups eg. older workers, low-wage workers, in a targeted manner -Ensure that government programmes should be kept fiscally sustainable 3.Foreign workers-Issue of competition between Singaporeans and foreigners for jobs has become sharper in this period of economic downturn-Many Singaporeans are feeling anxious and pressured about their jobs-With a small population, Singapore has to bring in foreign workers to grow the economy -Foreign worker policies are in place to grow the workforce in Singapore, rather than substituting the Singaporean worker-Employment Pass and S Pass numbers have come down since COVID-19 started -To ensure fair treatment in the workforce, there are different frameworks and organisations in place to do so eg. Tripartite Alliance for Fair & Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP), Fair Consideration Framework-Singapore still remains one of the few trusted countries that stand out – many companies have expressed interest in coming to Singapore to develop their business, which will create good new jobs for Singaporeans4.Politics-As our society evolves, there will be many difficult issues that we need to deal with -The government will lead this discussion with Singaporeans, build a political consensus around the right solutions, and move us forward-Attitudes and aspirations of Singaporeans change – desire more diversity, alternative voices, checks and balances-In the last General Election, many people voted for the opposition, while fully expecting that the PAP would remain in power as the government-Each new generation of PAP leaders has developed their own leadership styles and their own policy priorities-Tone of Parliament’s debate to shift with stronger opposition presence-At the most fundamental level, to make our politics work, both the government and opposition must share an overriding objective – to work for Singapore, not just for our party or our supporters', 'id': '7c6b19ea-7c81-49f9-b961-73c939868c30', 'score': None, 'probability': None, 'question': None, 'meta': {'category': 'articles'}, 'embedding': None},\n",

While 2020’s Budgets were targeted at broad-based emergency support, this year’s Budget will focus on accelerating structural adaptations, to equip our businesses and workers with deep and future-ready capabilities.Over the next three years, the Government will allocate $24 billion to enable our firms and workers to emerge stronger. This effort builds on the momentum of the transformation push started five years ago, when the Industry Transformation Maps were launched.JOBS SUPPORT SCHEMEThe Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) was launched in 2020 to protect jobs and help firms retain local workers. The Government has committed over $25 billion to the JSS, and supported over 150,000 employers for up to 17 months. The current tranche will continue to cover wages up to March 2021 for most sectors.Here’s how the JSS will be extended: Firms in Tier 1 sectors (Aviation, Aerospace, Tourism): 30% support for wages paid from April to June 2021 10% support for wages paid from July to September 2021 Firms in Tier 2 sectors (e.g. Retail, Arts and Culture, Food Services, Built Environment): 10% support for wages paid from April to June 2021 Other sectors: Continued support up to March 2021, as previously announced SGUNITED JOBS AND SKILLS PACKAGEThe SGUnited Jobs and Skills Package was launched in 2020, to tackle the anticipated labour market fallout from COVID-19. As of end-2020, nearly 76,000 individuals have been placed into jobs, traineeships, attachments, and skills training. Under the Jobs Growth Incentive (JGI), an estimated 110,000 local jobseekers were collectively hired within two months from the implementation of the scheme.Here’s how the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Package will be extended: Additional $5.4 billion for a second tranche of SGUnited Jobs and Skills Package On top of $3 billion already allocated in 2020 $5.2 billion to extend JGI hiring window to September 2021 Support for SGUnited Skills, SGUnited Traineeships, SGUnited Mid-Career Pathways Programmes will be extended The next phase of the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Package will support the hiring of 200,000 locals this year, and provide up to 35,000 traineeship and training opportunities.ENHANCING SALARIES OF HEALTHCARE WORKERS Beyond the pandemic, the healthcare sector is set to grow, as our people age. This sector provides many good skilled jobs that are noble, meaningful, and make a difference to Singaporeans. The Government will enhance the salaries of our nurses and other healthcare workers, such as support care staff. This will apply to workers across public healthcare institutions, and publicly-funded community hospitals and long-term care service providers.STRENGTHENING OUR LOCAL WORKFORCEWhile some Singaporeans are concerned about our reliance on foreign manpower, many businesses and trade associations have found it difficult to hire locals.The Government will continue to support the employment of Singaporeans, while we deepen our capabilities and promote capability transfer and moderate our reliance on foreign labour:Here’s how: Extend Wage Credit Scheme to support wage increments for companies to retain and attract locals Extended for a year, at a co-funding level of 15% Extend Capability Transfer Programme to support foreign-to-local skills transfer Extended up to end-September 2024 As of end-2020, more than 140 companies and over 970 locals have benefitted, or expected to benefit from 40 projects Reduce Manufacturing S Pass Sub-Dependency Ratio Ceiling (Sub-DRC) to develop deep skills in local workforce, and reduce reliance on foreign labour Reduced to 18% from 1 January 2022 Reduced to 15% from 1 January 2023 For more on Budget 2021, visit www.singaporebudget.gov.sg', 'id': '70432629-95eb-455d-b657-99d77b30c574', 'score': None, 'probability': None, 'question': None, 'meta': {'category': 'articles'}, 'embedding': None},\n",

       " {'text': 'how the mice sector is adapting quickly to covid 19 The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic had immediate repercussions for Singapore’s MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conferences and Exhibitions) sector.Speaking about the impact that the pandemic first had on the MICE industry, Veemal Gungadin, CEO of GlobalSign.in, a technology provider for events quipped: “In a matter of just a few weeks, we had all our physical events either cancelled or postponed until further notice.”For a sector that caters to a decidedly international audience – many events aim at bringing in an audience from top global markets – the pandemic has forced companies to quickly adapt and even re-think their business model.“While the logical immediate step was to start pivoting projects to the virtual space, we soon realised that it was not so easy,” noted Don Tsai, project director at First Wave Agency. With First Wave Agency specialising in events production, Tsai found that the entire customer experience was evolving to something very different, and the team was initially not familiar with virtual tools. Going digital Realising that it had to adapt quickly, First Wave encouraged team members to familiarise themselves with new virtual tools by participating in virtual product demonstrations. Employees also picked up new digital skills by taking short courses on topics like live streaming and cybersecurity, while a newly formed innovation team started working on potential fresh ideas for a situation where everyone had to live with the virus amidst the “new normal.” GlobalSign.in chose to focus on educating their customers and the industry on the paradigm shift by creating a Digital Events Academy. They leveraged their technology expertise to provide event organisers with a solution to move their events online. The result – GEVME Live, an all-in-one platform for running online events – has generated interest in countries like the United States.Reflecting on the increasing digitalisation of the sector, Aloysius Arlando – president of the Singapore Association of Convention & Exhibition Organisers & Suppliers (SACEOS) – shares a few observations he has made thus far.“The age of your company and team members does not matter; what is important is how you capitalise on digital platforms. Crucially, knowing your customers’ needs and how you can address them will allow companies to stay profitable,” he quips. Hybrid events from October From 1 October, organisers can begin applying to pilot MICE events in Singapore, subject to attendance caps and the necessary approvals from the authorities.The Singapore International Energy Week (SIEW) 2020, scheduled to run from 26 to 30 October, will be one of the pilot events taking place as the MICE industry gradually resumes. SIEW is slated to take place in a hybrid format that mixes physical events (for up to 250 people) with online participation. Robust Safe Management Measures (SMM) devised by the Singapore Tourism Board (STB), which event organisers are expected to strictly implement and enforce, will be in place for the upcoming pilot events.The specially developed SMMs under the Safe Business Events framework are meant to achieve outcomes aimed at keeping attendees and organisers safe. They include: Pre and post infection control measures, e.g. all attendees to use TraceTogether Controlled density of attendees Limited opportunities for close contact between individuals For infectious disease consultant Professor Dale Fisher, the pilot events will test how social opportunities – a key attraction of business conferences and meetings – can be integrated while adhering to the SMMs. Looking ahead, ensuring our healthcare protocols are maintained at the highest standard possible will be a comparative advantage for Singapore’s MICE sector, noted Arlando.Message to those interested in joining the sector According to a MICE Economic Impact Assessment commissioned by STB in 2019, the industry supported more than 34,000 jobs.The transition to new and hybrid event formats has created a need for more talent with new skills, passionate and well-trained individuals whom Gungadin calls “digital events managers.” These managers combine technical expertise with their event management experience to create engaging experiences for event attendees (both physical and digital).Both Gungadin and Arlando urge those interested in the sector to assess what skills they currently lack and explore opportunities like training programmes to fill those gaps.You need to “know your platforms, animations and chatbots”, mused Arlando, and be agile to shifting trends. “As long as you keep your mind open, you will have a good shot at not just getting a job but also creating genuine value.” New opportunities in the MICE sector Fuelled by growth areas such as hybrid events and domestic tours, over 2,400 MICE jobs, traineeships and attachments have been created. PMET roles include conference planners and systems analysts, while non-PMET jobs such as opportunities for IT consultants are available.

Lessons can be drawn from these overseas experiences: Cases in Israel and Victoria (Australia) due to non-compliance to social distancing measures (eg. going out when unwell, organising large parties) Clusters in Hong Kong due to falling compliance to mask-wearing in restaurants and cafes South Korea and Tokyo had clusters in settings where there is close, prolonged contact between individuals (religious gatherings and night-life establishments) Maintaining strict border controlsSingapore is adjusting our border controls in line with the COVID-19 situation abroad and risk of importation. Incoming travellers from Victoria, Australia; Japan; and Hong Kong Travellers entering Singapore after 19 July 2020, 2359 hours, who have recent travel history, including transit, to Victoria, Australia; Japan; and Hong Kong within the last 14 days will have to serve their Stay-Home Notice (SHN) at dedicated SHN facilities instead of their own place of residence. They will also need to undergo a COVID-19 test before they end their SHN. Travellers who left Singapore, from 27 March 2020 All travellers who left Singapore from 27 March 2020 despite the prevailing travel advisory, and travellers who are not Singapore Citizens/PRs have to pay for their stay at dedicated SHN facilities.If you are planning to enter Singapore, be prepared to be subjected to prevailing border measures upon entry, including payment for your stay at dedicated SHN facilities where applicable.Elevated community cases, but unlinked Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI) cases are in low-single digitsThere’s a daily average of around 12 new community cases in the past week – around half of these are linked. Close contacts of confirmed cases are actively tested to ring-fence possible onward transmissions.Targeted groups are regularly tested to help detect unlinked cases in the community. About seven in 10 of the unlinked cases were asymptomatic and almost half are likely to be past infections. Remaining cases in the community continue to be in the low single digits. Testing of those with ARI symptoms at first presentation have been scaled up and monitored closely; as it’s an indicator of underlying community transmissions.Update at dormitoriesAs of 16 July 2020, around 232,000 workers have either recovered, or been tested to be free from COVID-19.Testing of all workers should be completed by mid-August.Additional decontamination measures have been put in place to allow recovered workers to leave the dormitories and resume work safely, without compromising public health.Singapore cannot afford to be complacent, especially after we have resumed most activities after the Circuit Breaker period.

He outlined three enablers in this effort: Growing a vibrant business community Catalysing a wide range of capital Creating opportunities and redesigning jobs1) Growing a vibrant business communityTo ensure a business community with a strong spirit of innovation and enterprise that’s well-connected to the rest of the world, there is a need to restore Singapore’s physical connectivity. Hence, support will be set aside to transform the aviation sector for recovery. In addition, Singapore’s digital connectivity will also need to be expanded and our capacity for collaboration and innovation increased. This will be done through the following ways: Positioning the aviation sector for recovery Changi’s connectivity to be restored Investment in on-arrival testing and biosafety systems Creating platforms for creative ideas Investment in three key platforms to drive innovative ventures Corporate Venture Launchpad Open Innovation Platform Global Innovation Alliance Deepening global and Southeast Asia partnerships Work together with ASEAN members to pursue common frameworks in emerging areas, and enhance digital connectivity and cybersecurity Enhance infrastructure investments in the region 2) Catalysing a wide range of capital Secondly, a wide range of capital will be catalysed to co-fund and enable businesses to innovate, transform and scale. This will be done through the following ways: Venture debt for high-growth enterprises Ensure they have access to financial capital, by extending and enhancing the Enterprise Financing Scheme – Venture Debt programme Co-funding transformation of mature enterprises Co-fund adoption of digital solutions and new technologies Equity investments in large local enterprises Partnerships with equity firms to provide growth capital for local companies Transformation of value chains – Growth and Transformation Scheme Build on the Alliances for Action, beginning with the Built Environment sector 3) Creating opportunities and redesigning jobs Developing the skills, talent and creativity of Singaporeans is the last key enabler in supporting businesses.

       " {'text': 'minister chan chun sing making a living in a covid 19 world COVID-19 has impacted our lives, livelihoods and lifelines, and aggravated already difficult global challenges. Singapore is not immune. Many Singaporeans have lost their jobs, and more job losses are expected in the coming months. Some businesses have closed, and many others are struggling. We cannot save every job and every business, but we will take care of every Singaporean. We will not let widespread unemployment erode the confidence and dignity of our people. This Government has committed almost a hundred billion dollars to care for every Singaporean, help businesses and save jobs. Our immediate focus is jobs. We will create a hundred thousand jobs and training opportunities in the next year, to help those coming out from schools, as well as those retrenched. We will invest to develop our intangible strengths – what distinguishes us; our infrastructure – for they are key enablers; and above all, our people and businesses. We will work hard to make sure everyone who wants a job, can get a job. For businesses affected by Covid, we will help you to get ready to rebound when the economy picks up. The Government’s commitment to our workers and businesses remains unchanged. We will ensure that every member of Team Singapore shares the benefits of growth. We can be confident in our future. Our promise is this: We will create opportunities for all Singaporeans, no matter how old you are, to improve your lives at every stage of your careers. So long as you are able and willing to learn, we will support you. We will build a better Singapore together, where our future generations have the pride, the means, and the gumption to be called, Singaporeans.Full transcript:Fellow Singaporeans, COVID-19 has impacted our lives, livelihoods and lifelines, and it has aggravated already difficult global challenges. Trade and investments have come down. People and businesses in many countries have lost confidence in globalisation and technology. They have been disrupted, and their Governments have been unable to help them adjust. Bigger countries have been fighting over the tax revenues of global companies, and that has affected international competition for investments and jobs.Countries are all doing their best to keep people safe and healthy, secure essential items, such as food and medicine, save jobs and businesses in the face of severe decline in demand and investments.Singapore is not immune. Many Singaporeans have already lost their jobs. More job losses are expected in the coming months. Others have seen their incomes fall. It will be a tough job market in the coming years. Some businesses have closed. Many more are struggling. Most wonder how to survive, never mind thrive. This Government has committed almost a hundred billion dollars to care for every Singaporean, help save businesses and jobs. But it is not just about spending money. What is even more important is our ability to plan, adapt and execute.This is how we will do it.Immediate PrioritiesOur immediate focus is jobs. We will create one hundred thousand jobs and training opportunities in the coming year. The range of jobs will include healthcare, early childhood education, transport, ICT and financial services. 100,000 jobs – that is three times our usual annual number. This is how many we will need, to help those coming out from schools, as well as those retrenched. We may well need to create more jobs, if the situation worsens.We will also increase the capacity of our training institutions to equip more workers, especially mid-career ones, with new skills required for the new economy. This help will come to where you are. We will set up job centres in every town to match displaced workers to new jobs. We will work hard to make sure everyone who wants a job can get a job.Many say the best way to save jobs is to resume our economic activities more quickly. I understand. But opening up hastily and closing businesses again if infections spike once more, will be more disruptive to businesses and workers. Hence, let us resume safely, progressively and sustainably.Even after reopening, we should not expect ‘business-as-usual’. Some businesses will need to change their business models. We will help you to redesign your operations and serve new markets. Many F&B businesses like SaladStop and Beauty in the Pot have launched delivery-friendly menus to serve new customers. Others still have viable business models. We will help you to rebound when demand picks up. We will support you to hire and train graduates and mid-career workers in advance. Logistics and professional services are examples of sectors where we are starting to do this.Longer Term GoalsAs we tackle the immediate challenges, we must also prepare for the future. The Future Economy Council, chaired by DPM Heng, has been driving this for the last few years.We will invest to develop our intangible strengths – what distinguishes us; our infrastructure – for they are key enablers; and above all, our people and businesses.Intangible StrengthsFirst, our intangible strengths. Over the years, many investors have chosen to site and expand their businesses here, in Singapore. They did not make this decision for the short-term, nor did they choose Singapore because we have abundant natural resources, or because we are cheaper. They chose us because of our strengths, which are not easy to replicate elsewhere. We are open, and connected with the world, we are trusted, we are united and stable as a society, and we have a skilled workforce.For many countries, COVID-19 has accelerated the retreat from globalisation, and the erection of more protectionist barriers. Even in a more protectionist, less connected world, we can still make a living and more. We can build capabilities to play critical roles in global supply chains to produce high quality products and services that others value. For example, we make four out of the world’s top ten drugs, we are the world’s seventh largest exporter of chemicals.Our resilience comes from building networks, and diversifying our supply sources and markets. We will never be able to have everything we would possibly need, for the next crisis. Indeed, when lockdowns started across the world three months ago, many of our supply chains were disrupted, if not broken. Credit goes to the ingenuity and tenacity of our people for keeping us going. Our public and private sectors swung into action, reached out to their networks, opened new supply lines to bring back essentials like masks, PPE and test reagents from across the world.Individuals from PSA, SIA, SATS, ST Logistics, NTUC, Sheng Siong and many more. Without all these unsung heroes, we would not have been able to live our lives as normally as we did in the last few months. Thank you all!Another intangible strength is trust. Singapore is trusted globally. Throughout this crisis, we have also continued to show the world they can trust Singapore. We did not impose export restrictions or nationalise foreign investments. We kept our production lines open for global supply chains, including critical materials for surgical masks. We worked with companies to increase their production, so that we could meet Singapore’s and the world’s needs, and we facilitated the continued flow of essential goods and people through our ports and airports.In uncertain times, our trusted brand counts for even more. Businesses have noticed. When they make their next investments to diversify their global production bases, we will be in the running. Just as how we did not restrict exports during the 1970s oil crises – that enhanced our credibility later to establish Jurong Island as a global petrochemical hub.Our investors have stood by us through this difficult period. We know the challenges investors face, with manpower flows and family reunions. We will work closely with you to overcome the challenges together. We will keep faith with you, as you have with us.We will work to stay connected with the world, even as the world threatens to fragment and regress towards protectionism. Despite our size, we can show the way, if we have good ideas. When promoting free trade, our initial partnerships with Brunei, Chile, and New Zealand eventually grew to become today’s CPTPP.Together with New Zealand, we issued a Joint Ministerial Statement to resist export restrictions and uphold global supply chains. From a party of two, we now have eleven subscriber countries, and counting.We are building a network of Digital Economy partnerships. The partnerships will define the rules for competing and cooperating in the new economy. They will create opportunities for our companies to grow their overseas markets. We have concluded such agreements with Australia, Chile and New Zealand. More are on the way.Barring unforeseen circumstances, we look forward to signing the RCEP agreement this year. This will cover all 10 ASEAN member states, plus Australia, China, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea. It will lower the cost of imports for our consumers, and exports for our producers.These agreements and other FTAs open up new opportunities for our businesses, and will make us a more attractive base for investments to serve the region. This will signal to the world our confidence and determination to press on with regional economic integration.Together with our trade association partners, we will translate these trade agreements into tangible advantages for our companies, through platforms like GlobalConnect@SBF.InfrastructureSecond, as we develop our intangible strengths, we will invest in the next generation of infrastructure for Singapore. We will press on to build our connectivity infrastructure to reinforce our position as a choice hub for business, finance, trade and data flows. This is why I am here today at our port, which is the heart of our trade connections to the world.Our long-term plans remain sound. They include projects like Changi T5, Tuas Mega Port, and submarine cable hubs. Likewise, regional developments like Punggol Digital District, Jurong Lake District, Sungei Kadut Eco-District, Greater Southern Waterfront. We will pace the timelines for these projects according to demand. But do not doubt this: We will get them all done. Together, they will create a vibrant and innovative Singapore for our children – full of opportunities, full of life.We will also intensify the efforts to attract the best ideas and talent to compete on our side, and complement our strengths. Initiatives like the Global Innovation Alliance connect us with talent hubs across the world. We will make ourselves a more attractive safe harbour for talent, ideas and intellectual property, to grow more businesses and create better jobs. Competition is intense. Talented people, including our own, can go anywhere.I know many Singaporeans are concerned with foreign competition, but closing ourselves up is not the answer. We cannot escape competing with the world, and proving our mettle. We will give our workers the training and support to excel, and we will ensure that the competition is fair. This is the best way to improve the wellbeing of our people.Our Businesses and PeopleFinally, beyond investments in intangibles and infrastructure, this Government will ensure that every member of Team Singapore shares the benefits of growth.Let me highlight two efforts: digitalisation, and internationalisation.COVID-19 has pushed many businesses and consumers to embrace the digital world. The digital trajectory will only accelerate, and not reverse. We must enable every Singaporean, young and old; every business, big and small, to go digital and thrive. Companies will embrace digital tools to create new business models and transcend our local market constraints. For example, STB is helping our hospitality companies and event organisers to overcome the collapse in travel demand by using digital tools. One event organiser – WiT or Web In Travel – is engaging global audiences though a virtual travel summit later this month, across different countries.In the 1980s, we uplifted a generation through computerisation and automation. In the 2020s, we will transform another generation through digitalisation and data, and not just the young in high-tech companies. We are building a thousand-strong Digital Ambassador Corps to help small and micro enterprises apply digitalisation, and help senior citizens to learn to use the technology.But helping businesses access new markets must go beyond the digital online to establish real partnerships in the real world. Many Singapore businesses have established regional and global presence in the past years, often in partnerships. The more established and larger companies help newcomers and smaller businesses. For example, CapitaLand brings along Singapore companies in its overseas development projects, thus helping them to penetrate new markets. The retail and hospitality sector may be going through a challenging time, but CapitaLand will press on and do more to support our local SMEs.We will step up such efforts to nurture a new generation of regional and global businesses. We will facilitate more industry partnerships, including in the digital space, like how Singapore E-Biz and Alliance 21 are helping local food manufacturers drive international business. Likewise, we will better organise our overseas Singapore business chapters and missions to guide newcomers venturing overseas.Our business leaders and workers will be key to these efforts. We must have the aptitude and attitude to serve global markets. Our people must have the entrepreneurial spirit to venture abroad to compete, and seize the opportunities of a fast-growing Asia. We cannot be content with doing well just within Singapore. We introduced Scale-Up SG to groom promising local companies into global champions. So long as our companies have the ambition, we will find the resources to support them.We will intensify the overseas exposure of our people, through initiatives like the Global Ready Talent Programme, so that they gain fresh perspectives and networks. That is what we did for many students, including Carousell co-founder Siu Rui, Marcus, and Lucas. They spent a year in Silicon Valley, as part of the NUS Overseas Colleges programme. This laid the foundation and gave them the confidence to later launch Carousell, which their team has grown beyond Singapore to eight markets across Southeast Asia today. We will scale up such opportunities for our people.Earlier this year, MOE announced our ‘70-70’ target to enable more students from institutes of higher learning to gain overseas exposure. 70 per cent of IHL students to have an overseas exposure, 70 per cent to focus on China, India and ASEAN. We will press on with this once the COVID-19 situation allows.We will never be done upskilling our people. This is especially so for workers who have left school many years ago and did not benefit from the more recent improvements in our education and training system. Confidence for the FutureWe can be confident that our investments in our strengths, our infrastructure, and our people are all coming together. This is why in the first four months of this year, EDB has already captured 13 billion dollars of investment commitments, from companies like ExxonMobil, Micron, and ST Microelectronics, and some companies continue to hire and grow their businesses, like Innosparks, Secretlab, and Shopee.Even though the outlook for the next few years is uncertain, investors maintain their confidence in Singapore to base their new and exciting projects here. For example, Hyundai will be setting up their Mobility Global Innovation Centre in Jurong. It will be a next-generation innovation and manufacturing platform incorporating Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things, and robotics to produce electric vehicles of the future. When ready in 2022, it will create many new and exciting opportunities for our workers.Our local companies are confident too. In my regular visits to our local companies, I have seen many big and small companies in different sectors actively transforming their businesses, such as Prima, Hai Sia Seafood, and Markono Print Media. What cheered me most is that they have upskilled their workforce in the process. They didn’t leave the workers behind. ConclusionOur Pioneer and Merdeka Generations built our economy from scratch. They laid our strong foundations, brick by brick – Changi Airport, HDB flats, MRT lines, SIA, DBS, PSA and many more. In fact, they moved us from Third World to First in one generation, and saved enough to set aside reserves for future generations.They showed us what it means to be Singaporean. That while we are not of common ancestry, race, language or religion, we are defined by our determination to chart our own destiny, guided by the values of openness, inclusiveness, self-determination, meritocracy and incorruptibility for us to defy the odds of history, and not only survive but thrive with the world as our hinterland and our markets.55 years on, we are better positioned to keep Singapore going, growing and glowing. We will build a better Singapore together, where our future generations have the pride, the means, and the gumption to be called Singaporeans.….From 7 to 20 June 2020, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat, Senior Ministers Teo Chee Hean and Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Minister Chan Chun Sing and Minister Lawrence Wong will deliver a series of national broadcasts, explaining what a post-COVID-19 future looks like for Singapore.Clickherefor the other speeches.', 'id': 'a58b3f12-5865-4479-9f46-e89bcfb0cdd2', 'score': None, 'probability': None, 'question': None, 'meta': {'category': 'articles'}, 'embedding': None},\n",
       " {'text': 'avid volunteer delivered meals to 500 families While most Singaporeans were hunkering down at home during the Circuit Breaker period – wondering which drama series to watch next, or when they would be able to meet their friends for bubble tea again – 23 year-old Rini Shazwani Roslan was out in the sun, running from block to block, distributing food to the less privileged.For those affected financially by COVID-19, financial support like the Temporary Relief Fund and the COVID-19 Support Grant was welcome relief. But volunteers like Rini also help ease the financial burden of daily necessities and food.“Volunteering is natural to me. Whenever I see an opportunity for me to help, I will always ask if I can be part of the team. I want to help.”Because of her desire to help others, Rini joined voluntary welfare organisation Jamiyah Singapore, as a Human Resource Executive a year ago.This was not her first experience with Jamiyah FoodBank; she was part of the food distribution team in 2019. But 2020 would be so different – the Ramadan period was entirely within the Circuit Breaker. This meant that Muslim families would not be able to have iftar – the breaking of fast – and Hari Raya gatherings together with members outside their households.Photo credit: Jamiyah SingaporeIt was a harder blow for those living alone in rental flats. Many would have looked forward to the annual time of cheer, festivities and reunion, but were now faced with the prospect of celebrating Ramadan and Hari Raya Puasa by themselves. Some had also experienced a loss of job or income due to COVID-19.You are not aloneRini and her team from Jamiyah were determined that those badly affected should not feel alone during this time. They went door to door to over 500 households, distributing bento boxes so that they would have ready meals to break fast.Besides bento boxes, during weekend before Hari Raya Puasa, they distributed special Meat-for-Eid hampers – festive packages that contained ingredients for Raya dishes – so that their beneficiaries would be able to enjoy some semblance of normalcy and festive cheer during this difficult period.Whereas in previous years, beneficiaries could queue to collect the festive hampers at a centralised location, congregating in one location in the middle of a pandemic was not advisable.“It was very much different this year… Because we had to personally visit the homes of the beneficiaries, and that required us to cover quite a bit of distance.”Running from door to door, carrying hampers that weighed about 3kg each on both hands, was no mean feat for petite-sized Rini. While trolleys helped to alleviate the load, the journey across multiple floors and different blocks in Bukit Batok ensured that they were exhausted by the end of the day.Photo credit: Jamiyah SingaporeOnce, pressed for time as they had a long list of households to cover before iftar, they were on the receiving end of a beneficiary’s harsh reply, as their hurried knocking was misperceived as being disrespectful. Thankfully, the misunderstanding was quickly cleared up.Despite these challenges, Rini pressed on. Photo credit: Jamiyah SingaporeNot content with just a cursory ‘Hi’ and ‘Bye’, Rini often makes an effort to chat with them, asking how their day went, or how their health was. Older recipients often remark how grateful they are to have a listening ear.She remembers fondly an encounter with an elderly lady. Her son had gone to work and she was alone at home. To protect seniors, which are one of the vulnerable groups most susceptible to COVID-19 infection, Rini had to maintain a safe distance – meaning she could not enter her home. However, it was clear to her that the hamper would be too heavy for the elderly lady to carry into her flat by herself.Worried that her son would be back too late before she would have time to prepare for iftar, Rini helped to arrange for one of the elderly lady’s close neighbours to share some cooked dishes with her, so that she would be able to break fast in time.The gesture touched her deeply. Before Rini left, the lady earnestly made some doa (prayers) for her and her teammate, thanking them for caring for the less fortunate. Photo credit: Jamiyah SingaporeIt started at homeRini attributes her love for volunteering to her parents and grandparents.Growing up in a family of active volunteers, since the age of 9, Rini would follow her grandparents to the neighbourhood mosques and elderly homes to help out and spend time with the seniors there.Her parents, whom she regard as the most generous people she knows of, also had a big influence on her. Her mother often cooks – not just for friends and family – but also for charity events, while her father would always go the extra mile to help those in need.From following her elders as a child, volunteering eventually became her own way of life.While working life meant that she would not be able to help out in mosques and homes as much as she used to, Rini tries her best to volunteer at Jamiyah’s other outreach activities whenever the opportunity arises.Asked if these volunteering activities take away precious personal time from her, she answers, “I have never really seen volunteering as an activity that will take up my personal time… Because I see that as my personal time.”She adds, “I really enjoy the satisfaction after meeting the beneficiaries and helping them out.”Asked about her hopes for young people like herself, she says she hopes more will join her in stepping up and giving back to society.And it doesn’t have to be grand gestures, she says.“If we see an elderly person downstairs, feeling alone, we can make their day just by sitting down with them, talking to them. You don’t have to be an active volunteer, going door to door, meeting a lot of people.”“The smallest act of kindness can go a long way.”Photo credit: Jamiyah SingaporeWhile COVID-19 has been dubbed the crisis of a generation, Rini believes that the key for Singaporeans to bounce back from it is to be united in our efforts, and to stand by one another. While she acknowledges it is a tough period for young people now, especially those who are still without a job, her hope for her peers is that they would not lose sight of their goals and what they want to achieve.“Opportunities do exist, even in this current situation.”“Keep an open mind, be kind and compassionate to others, because you don’t know what they may be going through. Help other people – who knows, you may be helping yourself as well.”Volunteering her time has served as a reminder for Rini to always remain grateful for everything she has been blessed with in life.Her message to her fellow youth: “I certainly hope that volunteering will have the same impact on you too!”This article is part of a series of stories of Singaporean youth who have come forward to help the community, during this fight against COVID-19.

       " {'text': 'keeping you safe by keeping you apart About 3,000 Enforcement Officers, and SG Clean and Safe DistancingAmbassadors have been walking the ground every day since April 2020. They keeppeople in Singapore safe by making sure that those outside of their homes weartheir masks properly, and keep a safe distancefrom one another.The Ambassadors comprise officers from 65 public agencies as well asthose from private sectors whose usual jobs have been disruptedby COVID-19,like cabin crew and tour guides, and volunteers.Even though the Circuit Breaker period is over, they will still be doingtheir jobs in Phases One and Two as Singapore adopts a phased approachtoresume activities gradually and safely.Here are some of their stories. Sharon Loh, 37, Jetstar Asia air stewardessArea:F&B Outlets\"I am a Safe Distancing Ambassador who covers mainly F&B outlets like cafes, restaurants, coffeeshops in the central area including Bugis, Tiong Bahru, Telok Ayer, Lau Pa Sat and Marina Boulevard.Our focus is not only the people who are coming in for takeaways, but the F&B operators, including kitchens and counter staff. We want to make sure that they are wearing masks at all times and are observing safe distancing.For the kitchens, we go on “surprise” visits where we walk in and say “Excuse me, can I check your kitchen?” Those in the kitchens sometimes do not cover their mouths and noses properly because they are not seen.I understand it’s hot. But when we explain to them that it’s a precaution to prevent virus transmission as they cannot avoid contact with fellow workers completely, and that the last thing they want is for a new COVID-19 cluster to form in their establishment, they comply.What I am doing now is similar to what I was doing as a Jetstar Asia cabin crew for 13 years – I told people how to stay safe too, like putting on their safety belts or stowing their luggage safely. It’s just that now I share safety messages while on the ground.I became a Safe Distancing Ambassador after the company temporarily suspended its operations in March 2020, which left me and my colleagues feeling unsettled. Thankfully, Jetstar Asia helped many of us to secure temporary jobs to tide over this period. Many of my cabin crew colleagues are stationed at other frontline spots including temperature screening at hospitals, contact tracing centres, and foreign worker dormitories.My training means I am not afraid to approach strangers from all walks of life, address them appropriately, and politely remind them about the guidelines. I am never fierce, and everyone has been cooperative.In fact, many of the F&B operators are thankful that we went down personally to guide them. They admire our courage in being out and about on the frontline!I have also gained friends, as I become familiar with the F&B operators whom I see often. I have learnt much more about delicious food in the areas I have been patrolling, which I never knew about.Since I started this role in March, I also find that people have become used to safe distancing, and are automatically doing it on their own without my having to say anything. It has become part and parcel of daily life.\" Amanda Ng, 26, manager working in the Conservation division at NParksArea: Parks \"I patrol Bukit Batok Nature Park and Bukit Batok Town Park to ensure that people wear their masks, comply with safe distancing measures, and are not exercising in groups or with people from different households.I also help with drone operations, which are used to monitor visitorship levels in parks and other green areas managed by NParks.I fly drones in the larger parks and nature reserves to take photos of the grounds. The parks I fly the drones in include Bukit Batok Nature Park, Bukit Timah Nature Reserve and Zhenghua Nature Park.Doing so provides us with a high vantage point to obtain visitorship numbers in these locations, which is used to update the Safe Distance @ Park portal (safedistparks.nparks.gov.sg), which the public can use to look for a park near their homes that is less crowded before leaving their house to exercise. Before the Circuit Breaker period, I usually only saw regulars with a few new faces. Now, we see a lot more people who are new to the parks. The demographic of our park users is also a lot more diverse, from mainly elderly people in the past to more youths now.The most memorable moment for me was when we chanced upon a homeless uncle sitting on a rock at the Bukit Batok Town Park, who had been sleeping rough.We helped him by giving him masks so he would not have to re-wear his old one, chatted with him and got in touch with a social worker who managed to find him temporary shelter.Last I heard, he is adjusting well.The most difficult part of the job is explaining to park users why certain measures are in place. Some park users would try to argue their way out or feign ignorance.We have to patiently explain to them that the measures are in place for their own health and safety, as well as that of others.My colleagues and I are happy to play our part so that the public could come to our parks to stretch their legs and get some fresh air and exercise, especially during the Circuit Breaker period.\" Ow Tai Wee, 40, Banquet ManagerArea:Hawker Centres\"Since I started on 24 April 2020, I have been assigned to various hawker centres in the East, such as the Bedok Food Centre, East Coast Lagoon Food Village and Block 58 New Upper Changi Road.I am an SG Clean Ambassador deployed to help with safe distancing work. I work between 12pm and 9pm with an hour’s break in between.I remind stallholders and patrons, who comprise young adults, the elderly and families, to wear their masks correctly, and for patrons to maintain a safe distance of 1m apart, especially during the peak hours.The job can get quite challenging especially during the peak hours of 3 - 6pm when long queues can form within minutes.It is also difficult for patrons to maintain a safe distance of 1m when queuing within the confined space of a hawker centre.To overcome this, our team members taped additional floor markings with visible arrow signs to guide patrons on how they should queue. When I was working as a banquet manager, I spent most of my time in the hotel and was not subject to the weather. Hence, my first day as a SG Clean Ambassador was quite memorable. It was raining heavily. As I was outdoors, my feet got wet. Since then, I always have an extra pair of socks with me.Thankfully, most members of the public are quite supportive and cooperative when approached by us to practise safe distancing and I look forward to going to work every day.At times, when members of the public encourage or thank me for my contribution, I feel happy that my efforts are recognised. I also feel a sense of fulfilment as I played my part to help make the Circuit Breaker measures a success.\"', 'id': 'ef74e6f3-686d-4655-9fe7-e7e4a235a303', 'score': None, 'probability': None, 'question': None, 'meta': {'category': 'articles'}, 'embedding': None},\n",
       " {'text': 'unmasking the needs of others Wearing a mask has become second nature to most of us – part of the ‘new normal’ brought about by the COVID-19 situation.But for the Deaf and Hard-of-hearing community, masking up has made communication even more challenging – something that HR professional, football fan, and active volunteer Oliver Guo, 33, realised during one of his volunteer sessions. Together with his wife Amanda, Oliver noticed that some seniors had difficulties engaging in conversations when the other party was wearing a mask. Some of these seniors faced partial hearing loss and relied partially on lip-reading to communicate. A family affair The couple decided to look for a solution. They found their answer in clear masks. These unique masks had transparent panels over the mouth area to enable those who are hard of hearing to read the lips and facial expressions of mask-wearers. Such masks would be extremely useful for those who had regular interaction with the Deaf and Hard-of-hearing community – volunteers like themselves, those who teach the Deaf, or even members of the public.Their next challenge was to figure out how to sew the different components of the mask.They enlisted the help of Oliver’s mum, Mdm Cheong – now their oldest volunteer at age 70. Armed with her handy Singer sewing machine and a couple of YouTube tutorials, the couple got to work making clear masks. “Looking back, I probably would not have had the opportunity to spend as much time with my mother had we not started this initiative,” reflects Oliver.Oliver and his family started a Facebook page called ‘The Simple Deed’ to document their journey, gaining a network of volunteers through word-of-mouth. Their team is now 25 members strong. “Our volunteers have been amazing. Many of them with sewing skills have given us feedback or suggestions on ways to improve our prototypes,” Amanda shares.A simple deed goes a long wayTo date, Oliver and his team of volunteers have donated some 650 clear masks, to beneficiaries such as SADeaf - the Singapore Association for the Deaf. As The Simple Deed grew, they received requests from people whom they did not expect would benefit from the clear masks. One such group was preschool teachers, who use it to teach phonics to young children. The masks enable the children to see their teachers’ enunciation more easily, aiding in their social interaction. “Speak to people from different backgrounds,” Oliver adds. “We didn’t realise that some people faced difficulties conversing with masks on until we spoke to the elderly. I think we can become more aware of the needs of others by just speaking to and interacting with the people around us.”Oliver is happy to offer advice to others looking to start their own volunteering initiative. “Do your research – there are many resources online to support you, like the Singapore Together page,” he suggests. Through their Facebook Group, The Simple Deed receives fabric donations, and also makes calls for others who would like to volunteer their time to sew. A couple that gives back together, stays together“Both football and volunteering require an immense amount of teamwork,” chuckles Oliver, who is an avid Arsenal Fan.To Oliver, his wife Amanda is his most important team player. “I often come up with volunteering ideas, but without Amanda’s support, they would just remain ideas.” Indeed, while some couples spend time by going for a run or exploring food haunts, it is volunteer work that bonds the Guos. “In some ways, the time we spend volunteering is also our dating time,” the couple quipped. Oliver and Amanda have been active volunteers since they were in school. After getting married, the couple made sure to set aside time every week for their volunteering activities. Their volunteer work has ranged from helping persons with disabilities through animal-assisted therapy for instance, to sending food to the elderly. Says Oliver, “We don’t have to be doing the exact same thing when we volunteer, but at the dinner table we’ll talk about what we did, the conversations we had, what else we can do.“It’s how we create our shared experiences and goals.”Have an idea that can help others, or want to give back to the community?

Schools will continue to have safe management measures, to keep students and staff safe.During this time, other activities will also be resuming and more community cases may emerge.Hence, it’s important for students to take extra precautions to stay safe as they return to school. Here’s a guide.Before school1.Don’t go to school if you’re sick If you are unwell, please stay at home! You are also required to stay home if you have a household member on Home Quarantine Order/Stay Home Notice, or if a household member has flu-like symptoms such as fever and cough.2.Wear a mask Before you step outside the house, ensure that you are wearing a mask. In situations where this may not be practical (eg. students with health conditions), you may wear a face shield instead.School bus operators will be encouraged to implement fixed alternate seating as far as possible. If this is not posssible, fixed seating arrangements will be put in place. On both the school bus as well as on public transport, keep your mask on and refrain from talking.While in school3.Practise good hygiene Wash your hands often and wipe down tables and shared equipment before and after use. Schools will be frequently cleaned, especially high touch surfaces. Disinfection will be done daily. 4.Monitor your health You will be required to take your temperature daily.5.Keep your mask on at all times You may remove your mask when eating or drinking. You will also not be required to wear masks when participating in strenuous physical activities during PE. But put on our mask at all other times, such as when moving from your classroom to your PE lesson.6.Keep to your class Don’t mingle with friends in other classes and levels.7.Follow fixed seating rules Fixed exam-style seating in classrooms should be followed. Continue with spaced seating arrangements in the canteen where possible. Otherwise, fixed groups of up to 5 from the same class will be allowed.You should also follow staggered arrival, dismissal and recess timings to reduce congestion. After school8.Come home as soon as you can Avoid crowded places and minimise the time spent outside your home. Don’t hang-out at malls or other public places with your friends. 9.Speak softly in public places If you take public transport home, or need to pass by other public spaces on your commute home, refrain from talking (or speak softly) to avoid spreading droplets.Taking these precautions will ensure that our schools can reopen safely.

But there are conditions that we should all abide by, to ensure that we continue to stay safe. When planning for sporting activities like basketball games, booking a gym session and even indoor group workouts, keep the following Safe Management Measures in mind:1. Use SafeEntry, TraceTogether and take your temperature as you enterBefore entering sport facilities, make sure you’re well. If you’re sick , be socially responsible and stay home. Check-in with SafeEntry and use TraceTogether as these are tools to facilitate contact tracing in the event it’s needed.2.

Practice safe distancing and keep group activities smallA physical distance of 2m should be maintained between individuals playing sports. If you’re engaging in indoor high intensity or high movement exercise classes, keep 3m apart from others. If you’re participating in group sports and activities, it has to be limited to a maximum of 5 participants. This may include an additional instructor or a coach for organised programmes and classesFor groups sharing a space, don’t mingle between groups. The groups must keep 3m apart at all times.4. Contact sports are permittedContact sports with prolonged contact (like wrestling and jujitsu) can proceed if a group size limit of 5 is maintained at all times. Multiple groups can share the same space, but groups should keep 3m apart with no intermingling.5. Maintain personal hygieneAbove all, to protect yourself and others, maintain good personal hygiene.Avoid touching public objects and common touchpoints as much as possible, and use a towel to wipe your sweat (don’t touch your face with your hands!). Wash or sanitise your hands after your sport or activity.If you can, bring your own personal equipment.

Read more here.The Secondary 4 student from Greendale Secondary immediately thought about those who would have difficulty affording the face coverings, such as low-income families.Reusable masks would come in handy for them, she thought.And she quickly got to work. Fortunately, Beatrice had picked up sewing skills from her grandmother since she was 12 – in fact, she had previously started a little home-based outfit called “My Ah Ma’s Attic”, which sold items like pouches and pencil cases that she had lovingly stitched together.She chuckles, “I’m very skinny in person, so all my uniforms and skirts were always very loose. I would ask my grandma to mend it and make them tighter so they would fit me.“My grandma was the one who passed her sewing skills to me so that I would be able to do it all myself, and I can pass this skill on to future generations.”But sewing reusable masks was quite something altogether. Sewing masks from scratchAs any other young personwould, she first turned to YouTube to figure out the steps to making a fabric mask.“I learnt that you first needed to trace the template on the fabric, then cut it out. You assemble it together and then use clips to make sure they don’t fly away. The final step is to sew the sides and add the strings so that the users can wear it comfortably,” she explains.The fabric she uses comes from a variety of places. Some came from bedsheets or clothes they decided to upcycle, while others were from a “stash of fabrics we like to buy and hoard at home”, laughs Beatrice’s mum, Brenda Lin, a homemaker. Beatrice admits that she’s got a perfectionist side – “If the lines are not straight, I would want to pick them out and sew them again. If it’s perfect for the first time, I can get a mask done in 20 minutes, otherwise it can be half an hour to 1 hour!”Together with her brother, Adriel, 12, and their mum Brenda, the Wong family has made over 300 reusable masks since January this year. More time during the Circuit BreakerIt’s no mean feat – especially since the Wong siblings both have major national examinations this year.Beatrice is doing her ‘O’-levels, and Adriel is doing his PSLE. But the period of Home-Based learning during the Circuit Breaker gave them the extra time – and push – they needed.“We couldn’t do the outdoor activities that we used to, so the next best thing was to do something unrelated to studying, something not from their textbooks. It’s a different type of classroom learning for them,” says Brenda.For one, Beatrice learnt the value of patience.“By nature, I’m quite impatient, so I like to get things done quick and fast. But I realised thtat doing it fast would cause me to make mistakes. The lines won’t be straight, or I would forget to change the colour of the thread, causing me to have to redo it,” she says.But making masks during their downtime was something that both Beatrice and Adriel embraced.Notes Beatrice, “We have a schedule at home to follow, so during breaktime, instead of wasting time, sitting down there using my phone, why not use that time to do something even more meaningful, which is making those masks for those in need.” It’s not Beatrice’s first foray into helping others in the community.She also does volunteer work with charity organisation Helping Joy, assisting beneficiaries to de-clutter and clean up their homes, enabling them to live comfortably.“Before COVID-19, the volunteers would sometimes bring the beneficiaries out, befriend them and make them happy. Now we can’t really do these things as some of them are quite old and are more vulnerable if they contract the virus,” she says, adding that making masks for them is one way she can continue supporting them.Charity begins at homeFor the Wongs, giving back to the community is part and parcel of life, with the family frequently volunteering with ground-up initiatives since Beatrice was 12. Brenda shares her thoughts, “As parents, we are our children's first teachers. Knowledge can be gained from books, but values can only be learnt from home. “My husband and I firmly believe that some experiences and lessons cannot be taught in books.”She adds that she often reminds her children that all national exams are just a checkpoint. “Their lives and futures are not determined by a few numbers. It is the values and the attitude that will set their future path.”Taking the first stepWhile Beatrice admits that there aren’t many of her friends who are as keen on volunteering as she is, she feels it is a matter of just taking the first step.“I think they are keen, but they don’t really dare. They are scared, they don’t know what the consequences are,” she explains. For instance, some of them might have had experiences where they tried to help an elderly person, but the elderly person may have snapped back that he or she doesn’t really need the help, Beatrice adds. “That could be what’s holding them back.”She urges other youth like her to just give it a shot.“It doesn’t hurt to make the first move to help those in need. What you receive is beyond gratification. Step out of your comfort zones. You’ll be surprised that your hard work has paid off.She smiles, “After all these experiences, I can say that I’m proud of who I’ve become.”This article is part of a series of stories of Singaporean youth who have come forward to help the community, during this fight against COVID-19.Many have stepped up during this time to help Singapore overcome COVID-19.For more stories of youths who embody the #SGUnited spirit: The Beng who feeds the hungry Self-taught engineer puts in 200 hours repairing laptops for those in need Avid volunteer delivered meals to 500 families Find out how you can do your part for the community: sgunited.gov.sg\", 'id': '65f98afb-c401-4e45-ad06-019ca0124ffd', 'score': None, 'probability': None, 'question': None, 'meta': {'category': 'articles'}, 'embedding': None},\n",

       " {'text': 're opening safely in phase 2 [Updated as of 29 Aug 2020]Singapore entered Phase 2 of our gradual re-opening on 19 June 2020.As more activities resume, the number of COVID-19 cases in the community is expected to rise. To enable our economy and society to re-open safely in Phase 2 and beyond, the Government will expand our COVID-19 testing strategy, and further encourage digital tools that support contact tracing.Expansion of testing strategyCurrently, Singapore’s testing strategy is focused on active case finding among the community, and active surveillance testing amongst the more vulnerable groups. The Ministry of Health (MOH) plans to increase our testing capacity to 40,000 tests per day.First, MOH has stepped up testing of close contacts. Where MOH would previously only quarantine close contacts of confirmed cases, they now will test all of them before the start of their quarantine. This broadens the list of suspect cases, and allows MOH to isolate them early, preventing the virus from spreading further.Second, MOH has conducted comprehensive surveillance testing onall individuals above the age of 12 diagnosed with acute respiratory infection (ARI). This has allowed MOH to detect infected individuals early, as there is clinical and scientific evidence that a person is most infectious right before and immediately after the start of symptoms.If you are have respiratory symptoms, please see a doctor immediately so that you can be tested. All COVID-19 tests ordered by doctors at polyclinics at Public Health Preparedness Clinics (PHPC) are fully subsidised.Third, MOH will continue to conduct more active surveillance testing in the community. MOH will set up more Regional Screening Centres (RSC) to bring testing services closer to the community. Individuals with ARI, as well as those who require regular routine testing due to their work in higher risk sectors, will be able to get tested conveniently.Fourth, MOH will progressively reach out to identified community groups to offer COVID-19 testing on a one-time basis (from 29 Aug). For a start, MOH have plans to provide testing to community groups such as taxi and Private Hire Car (PHC) drivers, food delivery personnel, key vendors servicing foreign worker dormtories, as well as stallholders at F&B establishments. While there has been no local evidence that these community groups are of a higher risk of being infected, tests will be offered given the nature of their working environment, such as the high frequency of interactions with members of public. The costs of the tests for these identified groups will be fully borne by the government.Digital tools to strengthen contact tracingTechnology is another key enabler to allow us to open our economy and society confidently. Digital tools – such as SafeEntry and TraceTogether – help to complement manual contract tracing process, by speeding up the contact tracing process and improving its accuracy.SafeEntry – all businesses and services that are in operation are required to use this – it helps fill in a patient’s activity map quickly, so that contact tracers do not start on a blank slate. The records also help patients jog their memory, hence speeding up the time needed for activity mapping.TraceTogether works in tandem, by providing contact tracers proximity data, so that they can quickly identify people who have been in close contact with the patient.With more activities resuming in Phase 2, it is critical that everyone uses TraceTogether. There are currently 2 million uses of the TraceTogether app in Singapore. For those who do not have the requisite smartphones for the app the work properly, the Government will be providing TraceTogether Tokens from end-June, starting with elderly and progressively to the rest of the population.It’s a collective effort – play your partEven while expand our testing strategy and improve contact tracing efforts, it is important that everyone plays their part in our country’s safe re-opening.Remember – you are the first line of defence.Continue to practise strict safe distancing and maintain good personal hygiene, so that we can reduce the risk of transmissions in the community.With our collective efforts as a society, we can re-open safely and gradually resume more activities.', 'id': '97c688a8-7076-4053-9ac7-b68012ba17d1', 'score': None, 'probability': None, 'question': None, 'meta': {'category': 'articles'}, 'embedding': None},\n",

Even as we unwind, remember to stay vigilant and maintain the good habits we have been practicing.1. Use SafeEntry and TraceTogether (TT) when you’re out and aboutContact tracing will continue to be essential in our fight against COVID-19. SafeEntry tracks entry and exit records at venues to identify any COVID-19 clusters. Remember to “Check-in” and “Check-out” when visiting places such as markets and malls. TT – both the app and token – helps to identify people in close contact with COVID-19 cases and ringfence infections quickly. TT does not collect data about your location, but uses proximity data instead. Read more about TraceTogether here.Download the TraceTogether app on your mobile device. For those who do not own or prefer not to use a mobile phone, you can collect the token at your constituency’s Community Centres/Clubs.2. Dine-out, space-outLooking forward to catching up with friends and family over a meal outside? Ensure you and your makan kakis: Mask up once you’re done eating/drinking Keep the group small Practise safe distancing and avoid mingling between tables Avoid sharing food and utensils, use serving spoons instead3. Beat the crowds by doing Christmas shopping online Click here to assess crowd levels in malls before leaving home Use self-checkout or contactless payment when available Whenever possible, make appointments in advance, e.g. for the viewing or testing of products Follow safe management measures – keep a 1m safe distance away from others4.

It is false that there were 1,146 new cases. There was no instruction given by the Minister for Health or the Government to halve or under-report the number of cases. For the purpose of updating the number of new cases of COVID-19 per 24-hour period, MOH has always used 12pm as the cut-off time since the onset of COVID-19. There is no cover-up by the Government or MOH. MOH’s daily press releases publish information on all confirmed cases, including the number of imported cases, and the linked and unlinked cases at that point in time, even as contact tracing and epidemiological investigations are ongoing. MOH also publishes reports on the daily situation as well as an overview of the cases via the case summary table and dashboard which can be publicly accessed on MOH’s website. MOH does not act and has not acted in compliance with any of STR‘s posts.Additional ClarificationsContact tracing is a rigorous and time-intensive process, especially as case numbers increase. As there is significant public interest particularly in the number of new COVID-19 infections daily, MOH has started releasing top line numbers (i.e., the gross number of new cases which have been preliminarily confirmed) in the afternoon of each day, even as contact tracing and investigations continue. Subsequently, further updates and details of those cases are shared via the MOH press release issued later on the same night.We advise members of the public not to speculate and/or spread unfounded rumours.

So, before you step out your door, ask yourself if it’s absolutely necessary.For those of you who have to travel and find yourself on public transport, here are some tips to keep your journey a safer one: Travel during Off-peak periods Safe distancing can be difficult onboard trains and buses, especially during peak hours. Try to plan your journeys around off-peak periods instead, where there may be fewer commuters. Sit and stay apart from one another, if possible. Safe Distancing while queuing Try to keep to safe distances while waiting for the bus or train. Stand at least 1m apart from one another and do not rush when boarding. Keep your mask on Masks have to be worn at all times the moment you leave your home, and that includes throughout your journey on public transport. Try not to speak One way COVID-19 spreads is through droplets when we sneeze, cough and speak. Try not to talk on public transport (even if it’s on the phone). Practise good hygiene Wash your hands with soap and water as soon as you can (especially after touching common surfaces), or use hand sanitiser if washing facilities are not available. Remember to avoid touching your face. While a low number of community cases means that the risk to commuters is low, we can reduce any risk further by being socially responsible and keeping to these measures.

       " {'text': 'national day message 2020 My fellow Singaporeans,Every year, rain or shine, Singaporeans come together on the 9th of August for the National Day Parade, to celebrate the making of our nation, and renew our commitment to Singapore.National Day ParadeI have been privileged to attend almost every NDP since the first in 1966. One of the Parades I took part in was in 1968 at the Padang. The rain poured down, but the contingents stood steady, and marched past proudly, drenched, yet undaunted. We showed ourselves and the world that Singaporeans were rugged people, and had the steel in us to stand firm in adversity. Five years ago, SG50 was another memorable Parade. We celebrated our Golden Jubilee, and what we had achieved in Singapore. We also paid tribute to our founding Prime Minister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew. We mourned his passing that year, but also affirmed what he and the pioneer leaders stood for. In good years, our parades rejoice in our progress, and look forward to a better future together.In difficult years, we still hold National Day Parades, to renew our resolve to weather the storm and take Singapore through to better days.This year, National Day falls amidst COVID-19. We are not able to celebrate in our usual way, but we are determined still to hold the Parade as a symbol of our unity as a nation, like we have done every year since independence. We will have a smaller Parade at the Padang, and also ceremonies at seven other locations around the island this morning. Each location will symbolise one aspect of our response to COVID-19 – Providing medical care for Singaporeans at NCID; supporting our workforce with skills and jobs at the Lifelong Learning Institute; keeping learning going for our students at North Vista Secondary School; or sustaining our community spirit at Kampung Admiralty. We look forward to Singaporeans across the island, and also in far-flung lands, joining the Parade virtually and celebrating with one another. We will all share special moments like when the Red Lions land, the mobile column reaches our town, or the State Flag is flown past. We will all recite the Pledge and sing Majulah Singapura in our hearts together.Stories of everyday heroesThis NDP is also an opportunity for us to salute those on our frontline, fighting COVID-19. Many of them have gone way beyond the call of duty, and shown great generosity of spirit. Retired doctors and nurses volunteered to come back, donning PPE to serve on the front lines, in hospitals and migrant worker dormitories. Full-time national servicemen extended their terms to continue supporting COVID-19 operations. Public officers volunteered to be redeployed to organise and look after the migrant workers. Many Singaporeans stepped up to help others in need. Some went door to door distributing meals and groceries to the elderly and low-income households. Others refurbished donated laptops for needy students, for home-based learning. Thousands of public-spirited Singaporeans volunteered to be trained for swab operations. They served in the hot zones, including the dormitories and community care facilities. Migrant workers too played their part to support these operations. Their help was deeply appreciated by our SAF, Home Team and public officers.These selfless acts have made all the difference to our response to COVID-19.Bracing for economic difficulties aheadWe will need this unity and resilience more than ever. The crisis is far from over. Many countries brought COVID-19 under control and eased restrictions, only to see their cases rise sharply again. This can happen to us too, despite all our precautions. It will most likely take a year or two before a vaccine is widely available, and the threat of the virus is blunted. Until then, we have to maintain our vigilance and resolve, to keep ourselves, our loved ones and our neighbours all safe. We also need to be resilient in the face of the severe economic downturn. Singaporeans are understandably anxious and worried. Business closures, retrenchments and unemployment are all likely to go up in the coming months.But this is not the first economic crisis we have experienced. Just in the last quarter century, we have seen the Asian Financial Crisis (1997-1998), the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks (2001), and the Global Financial Crisis (2007-2009). Each time the outlook was ominous, and we feared the worst, but each time we worked hard to secure our position, gritted our teeth, and came through together.I am confident we will get through this current crisis too, though it may take longer. All of us must do our part, but none of us will be alone. The government is actively helping people find new jobs and acquire new skills. We also have the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) and Self-employed person Income Relief Scheme (SIRS) to ease the burden on employers and individuals. The Labour Movement is working with employers to create job training programmes and career pathways. It will also ensure that every worker is treated fairly and with dignity, especially when job losses cannot be avoided. Employers too must make every effort to keep their workers, and not drop them at the first sign of trouble. This will build loyalty, and encourage the employees to help their employers rebuild when conditions improve.Our experience fighting COVID-19, grim and hard as it has been, has brought us closer together. The shared ordeal will toughen a whole population, and bond us together as one united people. Just like how the Pioneer and Merdeka Generations were tempered by Separation and Independence, and economic crises in our early years as a nation. Let us brace ourselves for the trials ahead, so that many years from now, when our grandchildren celebrate National Day, they will look back on these times and say yes, this generation stood together, sacrificed for one another, and built Singapore for us.NS SquareEvery National Day, we remind ourselves that Singapore is a nation whose story is worth celebrating, whose history is worth cherishing, and whose future is worth building.When we hold the National Day Parade at the Padang, or at the Float@Marina Bay, the audience can see the Marina Bay skyline in the background. Marina Bay used to be open sea, but we reclaimed the land around it, turned the ocean into a reservoir, and progressively built on the new land, to create an outstanding and vibrant downtown. Looking out across the Bay, you can immediately see how far Singapore has come, and imagine the possibility and promise that Singapore holds.Today, when National Service recruits complete their Basic Military Training (BMT), they gather their families and friends at the Float and hold their passing out parade there. It helps them to understand what they are defending, and why generations of national servicemen have been willing to serve and sacrifice, to defend this metropolis that we have built together, and also the society that created all this: Our families. Our friends. Our lives. Our future.Three years ago, I announced that we would rebuild the Float into a permanent space to commemorate National Service, and the central role that NS plays in Singapore, and that we would name this space, NS Square. The design contract has been awarded. This is how it will look like. The development will be aligned on a central axis, with The Promontory on the opposite side of the Bay. The platform will become a red dot, shining bright in our city. NS Square will be the central focus of our new downtown. We will build a gallery there to showcase our National Service story, and honour the contributions of national servicemen past and present. NS Square will also be a community space for everyone, young and old, to enjoy. And of course, we will continue to hold our National Day Parades there.ConclusionThis National Day, as we celebrate across the island, we will be saying the Pledge and singing Majulah Singapura in unison – not aloud as usual because of COVID-19, but in our hearts, with more feeling than ever.We have dreams to realise, and goals to reach for. Let us show the world that whatever the challenges, Singaporeans will stay united, and prevail once more.I wish everyone a very happy National Day!', 'id': '55a15f57-96c2-4ef2-b8e8-e3ee181d3e5a', 'score': None, 'probability': None, 'question': None, 'meta': {'category': 'articles'}, 'embedding': None},\n",
       " {'text': 'weathering a storm finding a new outlook To overcome the loss of income during the COVID-19 crisis, taxi driver Mr Ho Seng Huat decided to take up the opportunity to make food deliveries. For the last two months, taxi driver Ho Seng Huat has been ferrying a very different sort of passenger. They never speak, and often smell good. They also need to be delivered to their destination fast. These aren’t regular passengers, but bags containing boxes of fried chicken and pizza. In his 20 years of driving a taxi with SMRT, this is the first time that the 57-year-old has to deliver food orders to supplement his income. However, this is just one of the storms that Mr Ho has weathered. His income had similarly taken a hit during the 2003 SARS outbreak and the global financial crisis in 2008. Both times, he emerged relatively unscathed as he managed to quickly bounce back from a temporary dip in passenger pick-ups. This time, it’s a different story—one that is more worrying. In his 20 years of driving a taxi, Mr Ho says the COVID-19 pandemic is the worst crisis that he has experienced. The Circuit Breaker measures that were implemented to control the spread of COVID-19 meant that Mr Ho would lose a huge chunk of his income for at least two months, since most people would be staying home. Previously, he could complete between 18 and 20 rides a day on average. But when people started working from home and cancelling their plans to go out, he was lucky to get five passengers in a day. “It was really tough for us between March and April. Whatever we earned was not enough to cover our daily taxi rental costs,” Mr Ho recalls. “I was very worried about my finances.” Fortunately, SMRT introduced a full rental waiver for taxis from April to 1 June, to alleviate the burden of rental costs on their drivers during the Circuit Breaker period. It also dispensed a daily rental rebate, which was partly contributed by the Special Relief Fund under the Government’s Point-to-Point Support Package to help affected drivers financially. It’s been a tough few months of poor business for taxi drivers during the Circuit Breaker period, as most Singaporeans are staying home and not going out. However, with a family to support, Mr Ho still needed to find additional income. While his daughter fortunately secured a full-time job in May, his wife was temporarily unemployed as the shop she was working at as a cashier had to close during the Circuit Breaker period. Hence, in mid-April, he decided to take up the opportunity to make food deliveries, on top of his cabbie duties. This initiative was a collaboration between SMRT, the National Taxi Association (NTA) and various food operators to help taxi drivers supplement their income to tide through these tough times. Each day, from 11am to 2pm and 5pm to 9pm, Mr Ho picks up orders from KFC and Pizza Hut outlets and delivers them to customers. He makes about 12 trips a day, earning between $80 and $100 to supplement the money he gets from passenger trips. Between those two delivery slots, he still tries to pick up passengers, but often, he is greeted by desolate streets and long queues of taxis lined up in front of empty taxi stands. “It’s a depressing sight,” he says. “But I’m relieved that I still have the opportunity to earn some income, it’s better than nothing.” Mr Ho makes about 12 trips each day delivering Pizza Hut and KFC orders to customers to supplement his income. In addition to the support offered by his company, Mr Ho also benefited from the financial assistance dispensed by the Government. So far, he has received the first payout of $3,000 from the Self-Employed Person Income Relief Scheme (SIRS), which grants eligible self-employed Singaporeans three cash payouts of $3,000 each. As one of the union leaders at the NTA, he also reminds his colleagues to apply for SIRS if they do not automatically qualify, as well as other avenues of financial support such as the NTUC Care Fund, which provides a one-off cash relief payout of up to $300 for eligible union members. During the early stages of the Circuit Breaker, he also joined fellow union leaders in distributing masks, hand sanitisers and bento sets to their colleagues to lift their spirits. In the past, Mr Ho always had something to look forward to—chit-chat sessions with his friends at a coffee shop, which offered a nice respite after hours of driving. These days, a phone call to check in on their whereabouts and well-being would have to suffice. “Everyone’s feeling a little down now, so we just remind each other to stay positive, adjust our lifestyle habits if need be, and hope that this crisis will soon pass.” After making his trips during the lunchtime peak period, Mr Ho sneaks in a short mid-day break before resuming food deliveries in the evening. Despite the tough times, Mr Ho has been making good use of the extra time on his hands. For a start, he has been thinking about what he wants to do next after the COVID-19 crisis is over, though it may take a while. He feels that it is difficult to be a taxi driver in this climate, and there will come a time when he would be too old to drive a cab anymore. So, Mr Ho plans to take up a security course to ‘future-proof’ himself and ensure that he still has a job after he switches his taxi’s engine off for the last time. He is also cherishing the time at home with his family. “Last time, I would drive for about 12 hours each day, sometimes late into the night, and rarely saw my family. But now, I get to spend more time with them, have conversations, and even get to eat home-cooked meals!” Eligible self-employed persons whose livelihoods have been affected by the COVID-19 outbreak can receive three cash payouts of $3,000 each in May, July, and October 2020, to help them tide through these tough times. Those eligible for this Self-Employed Persons Income Relief Scheme can apply at ntuc.com.sg/sirs/. Under the Point-to-Point Support Package, eligible taxi and private-hire car drivers also receive Special Relief Fund payments of $300 per vehicle per month till end-September 2020 to help them defray business costs.

       " {'text': 'pm lee hsien loong on the covid 19 situation in singapore We have faced the new coronavirus situation for about two weeks now.The Ministerial Task Force, advised by DPM Heng Swee Keat, has been leading the Government’s response to this outbreak. They have been dealing with new developments every day, and holding regular press briefings to keep Singaporeans informed every step of the way. Today, I want to speak to you directly, to explain where we are, and what may lie ahead. We went through SARS 17 years ago, so we are much better prepared to deal with nCoV this time. Practically, we have stockpiled adequate supplies of masks and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). We have expanded and upgraded our medical facilities, including the new National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID). We have more advanced research capabilities to study the virus. We have more well trained doctors and nurses to deal with this situation. We are psychologically better prepared too. Singaporeans know what to expect, and how to react. Most importantly, having overcome SARS once, we know that we can pull through this too.The new coronavirus is similar to SARS, but with two important differences. First, the new virus is more infectious than SARS. Therefore it is harder to stop it from spreading. Second, the new virus is much less dangerous than SARS. About 10 per cent of those who caught SARS died. With the new virus, outside of Hubei province, the mortality rate is so far only 0.2 per cent. In comparison, seasonal influenza has a death rate of 0.1 per cent. So in terms of mortality, the new virus is much closer to influenza than SARS.But the situation is still evolving. Every day brings new developments, and we have to respond promptly and dynamically. So far, most of our cases have either been imported from China, or can be traced to imported cases. When we discover them, we have isolated the patients, done contact tracing and quarantined close contacts. This has contained the spread and helped stamp out several local clusters. But in the last few days, we have seen some cases which cannot be traced to the source of infection. These worried us, because it showed that the virus is probably already circulating in our own population. This is why we raised the DORSCON to Orange yesterday, and are stepping up measures. We are reducing mingling in schools. We are tightening up access to our hospitals. We are taking extra precautions at large public events. I have already postponed my Chinese New Year Istana Garden Party for grassroots leaders, which was to be held tomorrow. We have raised DORSCON to Orange before. You may not remember, but this was in 2009, for the H1N1 swine flu. So there is no need to panic. We are not locking down the city or confining everybody to stay at home. We have ample supplies, so there is no need to stock up with instant noodles, tinned food, or toilet paper, as some people did yesterday. Whatever the situation, we can each do our part. One, observe personal hygiene – wash your hands often, and avoid touching your eyes or face unnecessarily. Two, take your temperature twice daily. And three, if you are not well, please avoid crowded places and see a doctor immediately. These simple steps do not take much effort, but if we all do them, they will go a long way towards containing the spread of the virus.Right now, we are continuing to do contact tracing and to quarantine close contacts. But I expect to see more cases with no known contacts in the coming days.If the numbers keep growing, at some point we will have to reconsider our strategy. If the virus is widespread, it is futile to try to trace every contact. If we still hospitalise and isolate every suspect case, our hospitals will be overwhelmed. At that point, provided that the fatality rate stays low like flu, we should shift our approach. Encourage those who only have mild symptoms to see their family GP, and rest at home instead of going to the hospital, and let hospitals and healthcare workers focus on the most vulnerable patients – the elderly, young children, and those with medical complications.We are not at that point yet. It may or may not happen, but we are thinking ahead and anticipating the next few steps. And I am sharing these possibilities with you, so that we are all mentally prepared for what may come.I am confident of the medical outcome of this outbreak. Most Singaporeans should remain well, and of those who get ill most should expect to recover. Among those who have been hospitalised so far, most are stable or improving. Several have already recovered and been discharged, although a few remain in critical condition. But the real test is to our social cohesion and psychological resilience. Fear and anxiety are natural human reactions. We all want to protect ourselves and our families from what is still a new and unknown disease. But fear can do more harm than the virus itself. It can make us panic, or do things which make matters worse, like circulating rumours online, hoarding facemasks or food, or blaming particular groups for the outbreak. We should take courage and see through this stressful time together.That is in fact what many Singaporeans are doing. Grassroots leaders and Team Nila volunteers have stepped forward to help distribute masks to households. University students are delivering food daily to schoolmates confined to their dorms on leave of absence. Healthcare workers are on the front line, treating patients in hospitals and clinics and helping them get well again. Business federations, unions, public transport workers, are going the extra mile to maintain services, take care of workers, and keep Singapore running. They are inspirations to all of us. This is what it means to be Singaporean. This is who we are.Let us stay united and resolute in this new coronavirus outbreak. Take sensible precautions, help one another, stay calm, and carry on with our lives.', 'id': '0c266689-e654-4f1b-8710-cd8f80dbf12f', 'score': None, 'probability': None, 'question': None, 'meta': {'category': 'articles'}, 'embedding': None},\n",
       " {'text': 'consultancy a dynamic industry on the rise If you think that it’s too late in your career to change industries, a chat with 36-year-old Zen Lye, a senior associate at PwC Singapore, might just change your mind.Previously an assistant manager in the construction industry, Zen made the switch toconsultancy, so that he could pursue his passion for new technologies.Following a dreamMoving into the world of consultancy work was something that Zen had never expected. But it must have been kismet, that his work in construction got him involved in the development of PwC’s Experience Centre – a centralised location that combines experimental, technical and creative resources to create an immersive experience for consulting. “What I learnt about Experience Centre intrigued me and I wanted to learn more,” says Zen, who then applied for a consulting role at PwC.Zen Lye at the South East Asian Experience Centre in Singapore Transferable skills in managing projectsWhat he lacked in consultancy experience, Zen made up for in transferrable skills in project and stakeholder management. “When I was in construction, I had to manage several projects and many different stakeholders at the same time,” Zen explains. The project management and communication skills he gained in construction proved to be useful in his current role, which requires him to juggle multiple projects. PwC Singapore also valued Zen’s earnest attitude towards learning, and his passion for technology.From implementing to creating solutions It was a shift that Zen desired – instead of implementing existing solutions like lighting and CCTVs, he could now move to what’s known as “iterative solutioning”, where he was involved in the creation of a brand-new product, testing it, and revising it for the next versions. To bridge the gap in skills required for his new role in consulting, PwC Singapore placed him in a year-long Professional Conversion Programme for Consultants. The programme enabled him to acquire new skills not just in consultancy, but also 3D Modelling, 3D printing as well as Python Programming. These skills would come in useful in building prototypes for new products in his area of work.Potential for consultancy growth in technology and cybersecurityDespite the current COVID-19 climate, major consulting firms have seen growing demand for technology and cybersecurity expertise. Opportunities in the professional services sector Consultancy is part of the growing professional services sector. Since April 2020, 9,000 opportunities for jobseekers have been curated in professsional services. For job opportunities in professional services, click here. For instance, PwC’s Experience Centre team began developing a contact tracer in light of the pandemic. Inspired by the centre’s Bluetooth enabled access-controlled system, the tracer enables social distance monitoring using a low energy beacon, and it’s currently deployed in Singapore, Australia and Luxembourg. Zen says he is especially glad about how the contact tracer has contributed to the fight against the pandemic. “The tracer was piloted in a foreign worker dormitory to help the organisation understand the possibilities of infections in confined locations, and also at a healthcare institution to ensure compliance to safe management measures,” he says.Stepping out of one’s comfort zone and being global-readyWith the COVID-19 pandemic affecting large sectors of the economy, both businesses and workers need to be agile and adapt to the current environment.All the more reason that one should “continue to push oneself, and be ready to try new things by stepping outside your comfort zone,” advises Zen. One way that employees can do this, to seize the chance to gain market knowledge through internships and overseas work opportunities. Mao Zheng, a Senior Associate in Capital Projects and Infrastructure at PwC, was on secondment to Yangon, Myanmar, from September 2019 to March 2020.Mao Zheng, during his secondment to Myanmar Besides relishing his visits to Mandalay, the ancient capital city of Myanmar, Mao had first-hand updates on project developments there, as well as face-to-face meetings with local clients and partners. “Being physically on the ground provided me with a good understanding of business norms in Myanmar” he explains. Sharing similar sentiments is Yi-chung Tay, Asia co-CEO of marketing and communications company VMLY&R, who feels that employees stand to benefit from having overseas work experience. Having worked in China for 15 years at companies like PepsiCo and VMLY&R, Tay shares that “it’s great to be in such a large market, as the stakes are very high.”While working overseas “gives you a certain perspective on dealing with uncertainty and change,” Tay admits that it took a while for him to acclimatise to a different cultural context. But he got used to it – albeit a bit too well in some areas. He chuckles, “My friends say I now drive much more aggressively.” Nurturing Local Talents for Global Aspirations The Global Ready Talent Programme (GRT) aims to develop global-ready local talent for Singaporean enterprises to expand both locally and globally. Through internships and overseas work opportunities, Singaporeans will be equipped with market knowledge to navigate the different challenges in overseas markets. To find out more, click here. Strength in difference Singaporeans are well equipped to work overseas – “we are bilingual, and work in a cosmopolitan environment,” says Tay. Many local companies have a strong regional presence, offering Singaporeans opportunities to be seconded overseas. For Mao, working overseas is a “great opportunity to learn and grow, both in and out of work.” Now back in Singapore, he is confident that he can apply the knowledge and leverage relationships he made in Myanmar for projects in South East Asia. Mr Tay agrees, “You gain a heightened awareness, and an ability to handle different perspectives.”', 'id': 'be5b2ff8-7e9d-466d-a2b5-1d4a035bb793', 'score': None, 'probability': None, 'question': None, 'meta': {'category': 'articles'}, 'embedding': None},\n",
       " {'text': 'the beng who gives out free packets of food Some hawker stalls in the CBD area may have closed their shutters temporarily, after seeing their businesses take a hit due to the COVID-19 pandemic. But not for young hawkers Jason Chua, 28, and Hung Zhen Long, 27, who run a rice bowl stall called “Beng Who Cooks” at Hong Lim Food Centre.The pair even started an initiative to serve food to anyone who is unable to afford meals – no questions asked. An Instagram post, on the @bengwhocaresfoundation page set up for this initiative, calls for people to DM them to place meal orders if they were ‘’unable to put food on the table’’.Indeed, during this outbreak, jobs have been affected and some are facing financial difficulties. *For information on relief packages and schemes available, click here.During the circuit breaker period, Jason recalls juggling both cooking meals, and replying to more than 500 texts a day. He received many donation enquiries too – not before announcing to his Instagram followers that the best way for them to help was simply to spread the word and order meals for those in need. Pressing on despite difficulties Not all was smooth-sailing – Jason and Zhen Long have been scolded by customers, and some have even taken advantage of their generosity. Jason recounts an instance where he realised one of their regular beneficiaries who had been getting free meals for two weeks was not who he said he was, after he bumped into him at a private gym nearby. These moments can be demoralising, but he says he tries to take these instances as a lesson learnt as they’re still new to this. He confesses that the finances are a challenge – the money he spent during the two months in Circuit Breaker comes close to their earnings in one and a half years. But still, the drive to continue remains. “At the end of the day, I just want to make my family proud”The motivation for this initiative runs deep from Jason’s own personal experiences. He recalls to a time when he was young and his dad was out of a job due to the financial crisis that hit Singapore. He recounts being oblivious to the situation as his parents did not tell him what happened then. “My dad was hit pretty badly, but he didn’t tell us. I was still eating fast food everyday. It was only when I was in secondary school that my mum told me how my dad was starving so much at that time.These are the life lessons that help Jason press on. During the Circuit Breaker period, Jason says he has spent more time with his parents. Through this, he has also realised that his parents have advanced in their years, and he feels the desire to make them proud. It further motivates him to carry on with this initiative. Despite the busy-ness, he says his wife is still supportive. One of his most memorable moments was his wife telling him “you’re always so busy, you don’t even have time for me.... but, I’m proud of you, I love you”.Inspiring those in needThere are moments that make it all worthwhile. A homeless man who had been taking free meals from them for over two weeks eventually told them that he didn’t need free meals anymore.Jason recalls, “He just came up to us and said, ‘I don’t need (the free meal) any more. I found a job. You guys motivated me. Seeing you work inspired me to get back on my feet.” Another beneficiary is a blind 80 year-old man, whom Jason says he’ll continue to give free meals to, even if the list of beneficiaries whittles down over time.As for his future plans, Jason says he will keep going for now – at least for the 10 to 15 customers who really need it. He’ll continue to give these regular beneficaries free food everyday. He admits that this whole journey has been a struggle at times, and his advice to fellow Singaporeans during these difficult times is to persevere and not give up.

       " {'text': \"standing by her patients and an olympic dream For many, the COVID-19 pandemic was a time to put plans on hold – but not for 29-year-old Joan Poh.Joan, who is part of Singapore’s national rowing team, continued her pursuit of her Olympic dream, while at the same time, taking a step further to join healthcare workers at the frontline. Gunning for the Olympics When COVID-19 struck, Joan was training in Melbourne. Her sights were set on the qualification race in April 2020 that would qualify Singapore for rowing in the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. At this point, she had been on no-pay leave from Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) for more than a year, to focus on full-time training. But when it was announced that the Tokyo 2020 Olympics were to be postponed due to the COVID-19 situation, it took some time for the news to sink in for Joan. Her dreams of being the second Singaporean rower to qualify for the Olympics would have to be put on hold. Naturally, she was frustrated. “I did put aside all my other life plans and goals, to chase the Olympic dreams for the past three years… And finally, come 2020, I suddenly couldn't see the finish line”While she had much to be upset about, she did not wallow in self-pity. Instead, when she saw that the healthcare industry needed all the manpower it could get, she made the decision to return to nursing, at TTSH.She felt it was the right thing for her to do, even though her goal so far had been solely focused on training for the Olympics. “I felt like I needed to do something, something more. I felt like it was a time for me to put on my uniform and go back to work,” she explains.Pouring her heart into nursing As a staff nurse in TTSH’s renal unit, Joan’s job is to assist dialysis patients. But she sees her job as more than simply treating patients. “I personally like to see the patient as a person with a dream and aspiration, like myself. And being able to speak up for their best interest is something that really draws me in, to learn about them as a person,” she tells us.Joan feels strongly that nurses hold an important collaborative role, in acting as the advocate for the patient, especially when the patient has to deal with medical professionals from various departments.As a nurse, she feels that she’s in a privileged position to make a difference, simply by listening to patients. “We see a lot of patients, right? But patients only see a few nurses or doctors. We are going to be how they remember their experience in the hospital.” she muses.Keeping the dream alive Even as she’s back in her scrubs, helping patients, it has not been an easy road juggling both training and nursing. When she was training full-time, she had the luxury of planning her training time and setting aside time for recovery. Now, she can no longer do that, as the better part of her day is taken up by work. “I try to wake up earlier in the morning to put in one (training) session. Then after work, I'll put in another session,” she tells us. It does take a toll on her. Her best friend, Qihui Ng, 35, notes how Joan is so tired at times it’s hard for her to stay awake even at gatherings with friends. But despite her grueling routine, Joan has taken things one step further, even finding the time to mentor her juniors in the sport. Sherdyn Teng, 25, who has benefitted from Joan’s guidance, is appreciative, as “not many elite athletes, with their busy schedules, are willing to go the extra mile of guiding juniors, but Joan does it, even while juggling her nursing job”. “I still want to know whether I'm Olympic material” Joan still has a firm vision to pursue her Olympic dream, and says she’ll keep going till she sees it come to fruition.Her journey was made possible by the people around her. Joan shares that the people who stood by her – family, close friends, and partner - were those who believed in her, even when they did not understand what she was doing. Her organisation, TTSH, played a big part too, allowing her to go on no-pay leave for a whole year. “I wasn't a winning athlete, all I had was a dream. And they saw value in it,” she says. With that, she’ll continue pushing forward as a rower, and the people around her have complete faith in her pursuit. Qihui points out, “Both representing Singapore in rowing, and being a nurse requires hard work and ‘heart’ work.“Joan has both.” The article is part of a series of stories of individuals who have showed support to fellow Singaporeans during this fight against COVID-19.\", 'id': '2e448536-4e9b-4cd0-a500-cde3f8c6734f', 'score': None, 'probability': None, 'question': None, 'meta': {'category': 'articles'}, 'embedding': None},\n",
       " {'text': \"how to practise the 3rs Reduce, reuse, recycle.We've all heard this refrain many times. However, did you know that the 3Rs of waste management are listed in order of priority?Reducing waste is the best option, with reusing products coming next. If the first 2 Rs are not possible, then recycle.Reduce – the best of the 3Rs. The most effective way to manage waste is to not create it. Whether at home, at work or outside, be mindful of the ways that you can reduce consumption of water, electricity, plastic and paper. Here are some simple ways you can get started: Water Turn off the tap when it’s not in use, e.g. while brushing teeth, or washing hands Avoid long showers; keep them to no more than 15 minutes Electricity Turn off lights and fans when they are not in use If possible, set the air-conditioner temperature at about 25°C Opt for energy-efficient appliances with either “very good” or “excellent” ratings Plastic Reduce the use of disposable cutlery by eating in, or invest in reusable sets Choose items that have less packaging Paper Use both sides of a piece of paper Reduce the letters you receive by opting for email alerts, or removing your name from mailing lists that you no longer wish to receive mail from Reuse – the second best R. If you are thinking of throwing away an old item, stop first and consider ways you could reuse it. Reusing or repurposing items gives them a new lease of life, and prevents unnecessary wastage. You've just finished your soda, and are thinking of throwing the empty plastic bottle away. While recycling is a good option, why not give the old plastic bottle a new lease of life as a watering can for your plants? Some other creative ways you can reuse old items: Old clothes could be re-sewn into bags, or reused as cleaning rags Old jars and pots as storage items, e.g. mason jars for food canning Invest in reusable items, e.g. a tote bag instead of plastic bags for your groceries Recycle – the last stage of the waste hierarchy is to recycle what you have used. While 60% of Singaporean households recycle regularly, according to a household recycling study in 2019, a significant proportion of respondents are mistaken about what items can be recycled. For example, 67% thought that soiled paper food packaging is recyclable, and 49% believed that tissue paper can be recycled.However, both soiled food packaging and tissue paper have come into contact with contaminants like food waste and grease. A lot of tissue paper is also made from previously recycled paper – the fibres are too short and cannot be recycled. Thus, both items are not suitable for recycling and should be disposed of as general waste. When recycling, remember to: Drop off electronic waste (e.g. old mobile phones, IT accessories) at these designated collection points Check what can be recycled by following the labels on recycling bins. Recyclable items include paper, metal, plastic and glass items. Make sure that the recyclables are not contaminated with food or liquids. Rinse containers before recycling. Do not put clothes, shoes and bags in the recycling bins – donate them if in good condition The Singapore Green Plan 2030 aims to advance Singapore’s national agenda on sustainable development.

       " {'text': 'factually clarifications on falsehood posted by sst on covid 19 cases in schools There is a false statement of fact contained in a Facebook post by Singapore States Times (SST) on COVID-19 cases in schools.FalsehoodOn 4 May 2020, SST published a Facebook post stating that “Education Minister Ong Ye Kung is responsible for numerous infections in schools after he refused to close down the schools. The schools were only closed on April 3rd, but at least 50 students and teachers were already infected.” These statements imply that at least 50 students and teachers had become infected with COVID-19 by 3 April 2020 as a result of transmission in schools, which is false.As of 3 April 2020, 69 students and staff in MOE schools, including the Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs), were reported to have been infected with COVID-19. Based on contact tracing and investigations by MOH, all the cases (except for 3 which are still unlinked) were attributed to transmission via overseas travel, within households, social settings, and a non-school workplace (for a part-time student). In short, none of the 69 infections were traced back to MOE schools, including the IHLs.Additional ClarificationsEven before the implementation of Full Home-Based Learning (HBL) as part of the broader national Circuit Breaker measures, our schools and teachers have put in tremendous effort to ensure that our students can learn in a safe environment. Precautionary measures included establishing new hygiene and cleaning routines for our students, fixed seating and assigned play areas, suspension of co-curricular activities, and placing students who are unwell, have a travel history, or who stay with family members who have a travel history, on a Leave of Absence.As part of the national Circuit Breaker measures, schools were closed and we moved to Full HBL on 8 April 2020. With most parents telecommuting from home, the closure of schools did not become a major disruption to our lives. Although students no longer attend school physically, the restrictions in place prevented them from moving around the community freely and exposing themselves to the virus. Nevertheless, a major concern with school closure is our students from vulnerable backgrounds, who need the support of schools for lessons, meals and guidance. These students, together with students whose parents work in essential services, have therefore been allowed to come back to school for care and supervision, with the necessary safe distancing measures in place. The arrangements for these students will continue during the May school holidays. If MOE had simply closed schools early, say from Feb 2020, we would have disrupted lives significantly, and the impact on students from vulnerable backgrounds would have been immense. Instead, we have kept schools open as long as possible, while keeping our students safe.', 'id': 'a63e5233-c798-460c-ae63-f3a6c30c2ae9', 'score': None, 'probability': None, 'question': None, 'meta': {'category': 'articles'}, 'embedding': None},\n",
       " {'text': 'govsg how tos how to keep safe if you must return to the office Working from home must remain the default for all businesses where feasible. This, along with video and tele-conferencing instead of physical meetings, would allow us to keep safe by keeping COVID-19 transmissions low.If you must go back to the workplace, however, here are five top tips for keeping safe:1) Stagger work and break hours Adopt safe management measures at your workplace to ensure a safe environment for you and your colleagues. This includes staggered work and break hours such as shift or split team arrangements. On top of these measures, you should avoid mixing between teams. These allow for the reduction of physical contact, lowering the likelihood of workplace transmissions.2) Avoid socialising with colleagues and sit at least 1 metre apart Some would be excited to reunite with your favourite colleagues after a long and isolating period of working from home – we are too! However, try to dine alone and minimise physical contact with colleagues from other teams in and out of work as much as possible. Should you dine with others, avoid sharing food and cutlery, using a serving spoon if necessary. Remember that the 1 metre safe distance continues to apply in Phase 2, in and out of your workplace!3) Maintain good personal hygiene Practising safe distancing is important but not enough to keep the community safe. Remember to wear a face mask even at the workplace and continue to wash and sanitise your hands regularly. Apart from keeping yourself clean, take time to disinfect common surfaces and high-touch surfaces (e.g. phones, keyboards, switches, doorknobs). These good personal hygiene practices would keep yourself and the people around you safe. Public health is literally in your hands!4) Use SafeEntry and TraceTogether We need to do our part to speed up contact tracing and minimise transmission as we ease restrictions. Check in and out on SafeEntry diligently and download the TraceTogether app to help establish potential clusters. With technology, this can be done quickly– a small price to pay to lend a tremendous helping hand to our contact tracing effort!5) Stay home if you are sickIf you develop any COVID-19 symptoms, be sure to wear a surgical mask and see a doctor immediately. Keep to one doctor as much as you can – do not ‘doctor hop’. Most importantly, keep safe by not going to work. It’s better to be safe than sorry!For more tips on how to keep safe in Phase 2 and beyond, check out the Gov.sg How-Tos.', 'id': '9c005e23-08f6-45b1-bd1e-6a39f3d8af85', 'score': None, 'probability': None, 'question': None, 'meta': {'category': 'articles'}, 'embedding': None},\n",
       " {'text': 'senior minister tharman shanmugaratnam a stronger and more cohesive society Singapore will face not just an economic recession with the COVID-19 pandemic, but threats to our social cohesion as well. We will need to work together to strengthen our society, especially in the midst of the economic dangers we now face. This requires ensuring everyone has full opportunity to do well for themselves through education, skills, and good jobs, keeping social mobility alive, and strengthening the culture of solidarity. To tackle unemployment, the Government is working with companies to ensure Singaporeans get work opportunities and get paid, and pick up skills while waiting for permanent jobs. Singapore has a more mature labour force today, hence we are making a concerted effort to help older and middle-aged workers. As COVID-19 is fast-forwarding many of the technological changes to different occupations, we are also investing heavily in upskilling and reskilling. Good schools are critical for social mobility – we are thus investing in schools and in equalising opportunities for children when they are young. We must strengthen our culture of solidarity. We are working systematically to provide greater support for lower and middle-income Singaporeans and to build a fair and just society. Ultimately, the greatest confidence we get in our future as Singaporeans comes from our social compact.Full transcript:My fellow Singaporeans,In this fifth Ministerial broadcast, I will talk about the challenges we face as a society, and how we must work together to strengthen our social compact in the years to come.The COVID-19 pandemic has raised the stakes. The fall in incomes around the world is expected to be the most severe in the last 100 years. But this is not just an economic recession. It has the makings of a profound social crisis, in one country after another.We are already seeing this happen elsewhere. It did not begin with the pandemic. Social divisions were already growing in these countries. But they are now getting even wider. Job and income losses have hit some groups much harder than others. Children without well-off parents are falling behind, with their schooling disrupted and little done to help them. All this is sharpening feelings of helplessness, and the sense that the system is stacked against those who are already disadvantaged. And it is bringing long-standing perceptions of racial injustice to a boiling point. Never think these trends cannot take hold in Singapore. There are many societies which used to be cohesive, but are now fragmenting, both in the West and in Asia. No society remains cohesive simply because it used to be.The economic dangers we now face compel us to fortify our society, and reinforce the strengths that we have developed over many years.Strengthening our Social CompactWe will redouble efforts to strengthen our social compact. First, we will ensure everyone has full opportunity to do well for themselves, through education, skills, and good jobs. Second, we will boost support for those who start life at a disadvantage, so that we keep social mobility alive in Singapore, and lessen inequalities over time.And third, we must all play a role to strengthen our culture of solidarity, so we know we have each other to depend on, in good times and bad. We are doing this through government policies to help those with less, at every stage of life, as well as through citizen-led initiatives and communities of care that are growing in every neighbourhood. As PM said in his opening broadcast, in Singapore no one will be left to walk his journey alone.Tackling UnemploymentOur first priority today is to save jobs, and to help Singaporeans who do lose their jobs to bounce back into work. This is not just an economic issue, but a social priority. We will do all we can to prevent people from being out of work for long, so they can stand on their own feet and retain their sense of dignity. Good jobs are also at the heart of our whole approach to building a cohesive society and tempering inequalities.The National Jobs Council is moving full speed ahead. We will secure the 100,000 jobs and training places targeted by the SGUnited Jobs and Skills package that DPM Heng Swee Keat introduced.The reality of the matter is that we face strong headwinds. As long as grave uncertainty hangs over the global economy, and trade and travel are down, new job openings in Singapore will very likely be fewer than job losses. So if we leave things to market forces, unemployment will rise significantly over the next year, or even beyond that if COVID-19 remains a threat.We are therefore working with companies, sector by sector, to take on Singaporeans through temporary assignments, attachments and traineeships during this down period, so they get real work opportunities and get paid, and pick up skills while waiting for permanent jobs to open up. The Government is heavily subsidising these opportunities. It gives people far greater benefit when Government provides support this way. No amount of unemployment allowances can compensate for the demoralisation of being out of work for long.The public sector will also bring forward hiring for future jobs, in areas such as healthcare, early childhood development, education and social services. It will step up recruitment especially in sectors which earlier had difficulty finding enough Singaporeans to fill up the positions.We have faced conditions of high unemployment before, but we are in a much stronger position to address the challenge today. Twice before, unemployment rose well beyond 6% - In the late 60s, when the British began pulling out their forces, and in the mid-80s, when we suffered a major recession. Our economy is much better diversified today. Our people are far more skilled. And the trust and confidence that investors have in Singapore is much stronger, as Minister Chan Chun Sing explained in the last Ministerial broadcast.Helping our Middle-Aged and Mature WorkersHowever, our labour force is much older today than in the late 60s when the British began pulling out, and in the mid-80s recession. In those times, less than 30% of our labour force was 40 years or older. Today, the proportion is 60%, double what it was before. And many of today’s workers are in fact 50 years or older.This is why we are making a concerted effort to help our middle-aged and mature Singaporean workers. Most of those in their 50s and 60s did not go beyond secondary school. They had much fewer educational opportunities than today’s younger generation. But they are a hard-working and vigorous generation, who have accumulated valuable skills and experience over the years, and still have many good years ahead of them. We will spare no effort to help them carry on with their careers in the most productive jobs they can do, so that they can continue to provide for their families and contribute to Singapore.The Government will give employers extra support when they hire middle-aged and older Singaporeans. We will also scale up the new Mid-Career Pathways programme in the months to come, so they get opportunities to work at companies and public sector agencies, and can prepare for more permanent jobs in future.This is, and must be, a national effort. And it needs new thinking among employers, to give middle-aged and mature Singaporean workers a fair chance to prove themselves. Employers need to reorient their management philosophies, and their HR and talent management practices.No Singaporean who is willing to learn should be ‘too old’ to hire. And no one who is willing to adapt should be viewed as ‘overqualified’. We will work closely with the business associations to bring all employers into this national effort. MOM will also watch companies’ hiring practices to ensure they comply with the Fair Consideration Framework.If it becomes the norm to hire mid-career Singaporeans and train them for new jobs, everyone is better off. Our workers will be able to build on their skills and experience and we will have a more capable and motivated workforce, with a strong Singaporean core, that every employer can rely on.The Future of Jobs Begins NowWe are also investing heavily in reskilling and upskilling the majority of Singaporeans who still have jobs.Many occupations are being transformed by the digital revolution and other technological advances. We have been preparing for this for several years.But COVID-19 is fast-forwarding the changes. When we talk of the jobs of the future, therefore, it is not some far-off or hypothetical possibility. The future begins now.That is why we have expanded training opportunities in every sector and every job, through the Next Bound of SkillsFuture, like here at e2i. Keeping Social Mobility AliveThese efforts will not only give Singaporeans good jobs, but also help with social mobility. When everyone keeps learning throughout life, they can advance through the skills and mastery they acquire rather than grades earned long ago in school. We are progressively developing this meritocracy of life.But good schools are critical to social mobility too.Social mobility is what Singapore has been about, and how we have transformed our society since the 1960s. Generations of children from humble backgrounds have moved up in life, through education, and by working hard in their jobs and businesses. Even today, Singaporeans who grow up in lower income families have a better chance of moving up the income ladder than those in most other advanced countries.We must never become a society where social pedigree and connections count for more than ability and effort.However, there is nothing natural or pre-ordained about social mobility. Every successful country has in fact found that it gets more difficult to sustain this with time. Parents who themselves had higher education or who have become better off are investing more in their children, and moving them further ahead of the rest. We are investing a lot more into equalising opportunities when children are young. We are expanding KidStart, to help lower income families and their children in the earliest years, which are critical to their development. And we have upgraded the preschool profession, and set up the National Institute of Early Childhood Development to raise standards. So whichever preschool your child goes to, he or she will have a good start.We are also investing more in our schools, to make sure that every student who needs extra support will get it. During the recent circuit-breaker, our teachers made great effort to help students from poorer homes and those at risk, to ensure they did not fall behind.But it is also an ongoing, broader effort. MOE has been allocating extra resources to schools for students from disadvantaged backgrounds. We will give them even more support in the coming years, by hiring more teachers, allied educators, student welfare officers, and teacher-counsellors. They will strengthen the school teams that support students who are doing less well in primary schools, and our UPLIFT efforts to help those at risk. And they will help students to go as far as they can through the Full Subject-Based Banding system in secondary schools.Minister Ong Ye Kung is also accelerating plans to equip all secondary school students with a personal laptop or tablet for learning. They will each have their own device by next year, seven years ahead of the original target. When you add up all we are doing, starting from the earliest years of childhood, we are making a determined effort to keep Singapore a place where every individual can do well, regardless of their starting points.Building a Stronger Culture of Solidarity We must remain a society where self-effort is rewarded, and each one of us takes pride in achieving something in life. But we also need, more than we did in the earlier years, a strong spirit of selflessness and solidarity, looking out for the vulnerable, and supporting each other. Not because we are obliged to do so, but because it makes us a better society together.We have seen this solidarity in action in the COVID-19 crisis. Singaporeans from all walks of life have come forward to support those who were most affected by the crisis, including by serving on the frontlines.These community efforts have complemented the Government’s social support schemes to help Singaporeans through the crisis. They are schemes responding to today’s crisis, but they are also part of a broader re-orientation in our social policies, that began well before COVID-19, and will outlast it. We are working systematically to provide greater support for lower and middle-income Singaporeans and to build a fair and just society.We will strengthen these policies in the coming years. No one can tell what world will emerge when COVID-19 is over, or whether it has entered a long period of economic stagnation as many fear. But we will do all we can to make ours a more cohesive society, and do it in ways that can be sustained into the next generation. And we must all do our utmost to avoid the rifts and fractures that we see developing in many other societies.The Government has increased subsidies for lower and middle-income families in education, housing and healthcare, including CHAS. We are also boosting Silver Support, to help our poorer retirees.But very importantly, we continue to strengthen support for our lower income Singaporeans at work. Through Workfare and the Special Employment Credit, the Government pays as much as 40% on top of the wages that employers pay older lower-income workers.We are also making progress in uplifting our lowest paid workers, and will go further. Through the Progressive Wage Model (PWM), our cleaners, security officers and landscape workers have seen their wages increase by 30% in real terms over the last 5 years. That is not the end of it. Progressive Wages are not a one-off, but a ladder for continuing improvement.In time, we want every sector to have Progressive Wages, with this clear ladder of skills, better jobs, and better wages for those with lower pay. Minister Josephine Teo at MOM is working actively with the tripartite partners on this. They will bring in the industry associations, to work out schemes that can be practically adopted in the different industries.Likewise, we want to provide lower-income Singaporeans in short-term contract work with opportunities to get more stable jobs, better protection and the chance to progress in their careers.These measures will bring meaningful and continuing improvements in pay and conditions for our lower-income workers. It may lead to a small rise in the cost of services that we all pay for. But it is a small price for us to pay for better jobs and income security for those who need it most, and a fair society.Our Confidence in the Future It is about the compact of self-effort and selflessness that we must strengthen in our culture. It is about the networks and initiatives that we saw spring up in this COVID-19 crisis. About the interest we take in each other, at workplaces and in the community, because we all make up the fabric of Singapore. About respecting every individual regardless of their job, and respecting their effort to overcome setbacks and make the best they can of life. And it is about how we draw closer to each other, regardless of race, religion or social background.It is how we journey together. A forward-looking, spirited and more cohesive society.From 7 to 20 June 2020, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat, Senior Ministers Teo Chee Hean and Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Minister Chan Chun Sing and Minister Lawrence Wong will deliver a series of national broadcasts, explaining what a post-COVID-19 future looks like for Singapore.Click herefor the other speeches.', 'id': 'c631ea3e-4f34-445d-9895-c0429c7bd327', 'score': None, 'probability': None, 'question': None, 'meta': {'category': 'articles'}, 'embedding': None},\n",

       " {'text': 'charting a path amid uncertain waters When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, Loh Wei Hao, 25, was in his final year of university. While the naval architecture undergrad and his course mates adjusted to online classes and doing projects at home, another transition beckoned – entering the workforce.Wei Hao began looking at employment options about a month before his final examinations, starting with jobs opportunities in Marine and Offshore. What he encountered was a job market reeling from an unprecedented global pandemic. “There were many applicants eyeing the same job. I sent out many resumes but the majority of them did not get back to me,” Wei Hao recounts. Wei Hao’s challenging job search was by no means unique. Across Singapore and around the world, fresh graduates faced the stark reality of a global jobs crisis. Permanent jobs were hard to come by. So, when the Government implemented the SGUnited Traineeships programme, Wei Hao’s interest was piqued. “The programme would provide a stepping stone for me to transition into the industry, while picking up valuable skills,” he says. Because of his interest in process automation, Wei Hao secured a traineeship in September 2020 as an automation hardware design engineer at an SME, Excel Marco Industrial Systems.Dropping an anchor in the Marine and Offshore sub-sectorThrough the traineeship, Wei Hao gained technical skills in areas such as hardware design and the testing of automation control systems. Working with colleagues from different backgrounds has also allowed him to strengthen soft skills like communication. Additionally, Wei Hao sees the benefits of working at a SME. “Instead of being limited to working on hardware, I have been exposed to all aspects of projects,” he says. “I am always encouraged by my seniors to be curious so that I can learn more.” The traineeship has also been useful in directing Wei Hao in the next course of his career – he now aims to become a technical specialist for process automation and safety systems. Jobs and traineeships in Marine and Offshore The Marine and Offshore sub-sector is part of the wider Manufacturing industry in Singapore. As of October 2020, there were around 10,400 openings in Manufacturing under the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Package. Of these openings, 800 were in the Marine and Offshore sub-sector. Traineeship opportunities, like the one Wei Hao took up, are available in roles such as Project Management Engineer, Design Engineer and Automation Process Engineer. Explore job and training opportunities available here. Learning never stops, even for someone at a different stage of his career, like 38-year-old Steven Lee.A Mechanical Engineering graduate, Steven joined Sembcorp Marine (SCM) 18 years ago as an Assistant Engineer and worked his way up the ranks. In 2018, Steven enrolled in a six-month redeployment Professional Conversion Programme (PCP) for Marine Engineers. This included both classroom and on-the-job-training where he attended a two-week overseas attachment at the Malaysia Institut Teknologi Petroleum PETRONAS (INSTEP) to gain experience at a production plant.“It was a significant change,” Steven recalls. “I had to familiarise myself with new technical terms in floating production storage and offloading systems (FPSO) and gas-related projects.” Captaining his own crew Following the PCP, Steven’s duties shifted to project management in the area of design and system integration. There was also an increase in responsibility, as Steven began managing his own team. Having since led his team in various projects, he is grateful for how the PCP prepared him for his new role. “The PCP bridged my knowledge gaps and I was able to quickly apply what I learnt,” he says. Steven now engages customers with greater confidence, as he better understands their requirements and is able to propose customised technical solutions to meet their needs. And he is excited to upgrade his skills even further. “I am a firm believer in lifelong learning and am keen to take up more training programmes in growth areas.”Setting sail into new watersAnother mid-career worker to undergo the PCP for Marine Engineers is George Wee. George is currently an assistant manager for production (marine and offshore engineering) at ICF International, a company that specialises in cruise ship solutions.Previously a technical sales executive in precision engineering, the 39-year-old was recommended by a friend to join ICF International. “I did some research about cruise ship refurbishment and ICF. And since going on a cruise is often cheaper compared to flying, I thought the cruise industry would continue to do well,” George explains. To ease his transition and plug the skills gaps, ICF International enrolled him in the PCP for Marine Engineer after getting the mid-career switcher onboard the company. George initially found the transition to a new field challenging. “The work environment is totally different. I had to re-learn everything,” George recalls. As part of the PCP, George would regularly go aboard ships and learn from his mentors involved in ongoing projects. Besides that, he underwent a variety of courses, of durations ranging from a few days to two-weeks.During overseas training stints in Germany and Finland, George also had the opportunity to experience working at large and established shipyards. “From ground zero, I got to see how things were being put together for large cruise ships.” George enthuses. Back in Singapore, he is able to apply what he had learnt –for instance, he was involved in fabrication and steel work in the recent “Cruises to nowhere” that resumed in December 2020. Looking back, George highlights the AutoCAD (a computer-aided tool that helps designers create drawings and design) course as being especially useful. “Previously, I was involved in sales, so I didn’t have much background in technical drawings. At my current workplace, I need to understand technical drawings to manufacture different products,” he says. While he admits that it is tough “move from your comfort zone into a new industry”, he urges others to persevere through the challenges. “I encounter new problems quite regularly”, he laughs. “But I’m learning something new every day.” PCP for mid-career workers The Professional Conversion Programme (PCP) is a career conversion programme aimed at helping mid-career professionals undergo skills conversion to transit into new occupations and sectors. Steven and George went through the redeployment and place-and-train modes of the PCP for the Marine Engineers respectively.

       " {'text': 'tips for battling stress and anxiety during covid 19 Some of us have never lived through a crisis like COVID-19, and may find it difficult to handle the pandemic mentally and emotionally.Trained psychiatrist Lieutenant-Colonel (Dr) Soh Teck Hwee recently volunteered with the National CARE Hotline, which was set up to support people who feel stressed and anxious about the evolving COVID-19 pandemic.Dr Soh, who is also a member of the Singapore Armed Forces Medical Corps, provided a listening ear and dispensed advice to hotline callers who needed emotional support.Is it normal to feel stressed during this COVID-19 pandemic?Yes. It is normal to feel concerned, worried, anxious and even mildly depressed. These are unprecedented times for Singapore residents and it is important that their emotional and psychological health are being taken care of.The 24/7 National CARE Hotline complements existing support measures – such as phone or online counselling platforms – by providing additional emotional support and psychological first aid to individuals who may be distressed and in need of mental health and psychosocial support.During my volunteer stint, people who called the hotline had a range of concerns – some experienced negative emotions, while others had challenges in daily living such as financial hardship, as well as fears of domestic violence.We provided a listening ear and comforted the callers and, for most of them, these were sufficient. We also connected them to information and avenues of help, such as financial assistance or caregiver facilities for those struggling with caring for elderly family members.How do I tell if I am stressed?People may not know that they are stressed, or that what they are feeling or doing is a result of stress. Stress can affect how we feel, how we think and how we behave. Some possible symptoms include:Mental Having a loss of concentration Being more forgetful Having difficulty making decisions Physical Feeling more tired Having unexplained aches Having rapid breathing and heart rate Emotional Being short-tempered Getting irritated more easily Being more prone to worrying or tearfulness Children and elderly may show stress in different ways. For instance, children might refuse to play, become clingy, or suffer from poor sleep.How can I cope with anxiety and stress? Don’t bottle up your feelings. Recognise the symptoms and accept your feelings. Connect with others, either within your household or with friends online or over the phone, and express your emotions. It is important to continue to self-care. Keep exercising, eat regular healthy meals and keep to your normal bedtime even if you do not have to go to work the next day. If you find that your mood is worsening and you are having increasing difficulty coping with the pandemic, it is important to seek help early. Do not rely on alcohol or other maladaptive coping mechanisms like drugs of abuse.Please call the 24-hour National CARE Hotline and speak with our trained counsellors who can help you process your feelings and guide you through practical and healthy coping tactics.What can I do to support my loved ones if they are showing signs of anxiety and stress?One simple step is to acknowledge the concerns and provide simple reassurance or instil hope. For example, for someone facing financial difficulties, you could say “I know we may lose our income and things could be hard over the next few months but let’s take it one step at a time together to see what can be done\".If you are a frontline worker and your family is worried for your health, you could assure them, \"I know you are worried about me, and you are right to be worried. I will take the necessary precautions and look after myself\". Need Help? Call 1800-202-6868 If you are feeling stressed, anxious or alone and you need to talk to a trained professional, the National CARE Hotline is open 24/7. Over 400 psychologists, counsellors, social workers, psychiatrists and public officers have volunteered to man the hotline. They will offer emotional support if you are feeling stressed over your job, finances, marital and family tensions arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. Our trained officers will also direct you to community and public resources, such as social service agencies or hospitals and polyclinics, should you require further assistance.

       " {'text': 'coping with covid 19 economic measures The 2019-Coronavirus, or COVID-19 has impacted the global economy – as well as our local economy – in a big way.Sectors such as tourism and transport havebeen directly affected. And since China is an indispensable part of the global economy, other sectors, such as manufacturing, retail and F&B can expect to be impacted too.Here are six ways that the Government is helping companies and workers stay afloat.1. A Stabilisation and Support package for workers and enterprisesThe Government will support Singapore firms and workers in the coming months, with a $4 billion package.A Jobs Support Scheme will help enterprises retain local workers, while an enhanced Wage Credit Scheme will support wage increases for Singaporean workers.To help firms with cash flow, a Corporate Income Tax rebate was announced for 2020, and several tax treatments under the corporate tax system will be enhanced for a year. There will also be help for enterprises to access working capital more easily with the enhanced Enterprise Financing Scheme’s Working Capital Loan component.To support tenants and lessees of Government managed properties, options for more flexible rental payments will be introduced.Besides these measures, firms are also encouraged to diversify.Diversification should apply to(i) Supply chains; as China is involved in many high-tech manufacturing activities(ii) The country’s foreign workforce2. Support for the tourism sectorThe Singapore Tourism Board earlier announcedthat the licence fees for hotels, travel agents and tour guides will be waived as part of measures to help the tourism sector.The STB had earlier estimated that international visitor arrivals may fall by 20 to 30 per cent this year.This is due to a decline of travellers coming through Changi Airport, as well as an increase in hotel room cancellations. A number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 were travellers from Wuhan, and had put up in Singapore hotels.STB will defray the cleaning and disinfecting cost of these hotels that provided accomodation to the confirmed and suspected cases.Up to 50 per cent of third-party professional cleaning fees will be covered, with a cap of $20,000 per hotel with confirmed cases, and a cap of $10,000 per hotel with suspected cases.At Budget 2020,DPM Heng announced property tax rebates for the year 2020, for the accommodation and function room components of licensed hotels and serviced apartments, and prescribed MICE venues. Rebates will also apply to ferry terminals and Integrated Resorts.A Temporary Bridging Loan Programme will be introduced to provide more cash flow for enterprises in the tourism sector.3. Support for the aviation sectorRebates on aircraft landing and parking charges, assistance to ground handling agents, and rental rebates for shops and cargo agents at Changi Airport were announced at Budget 2020.There will also be a 15 per cent Property Tax Rebatefor Changi Airport.4. Helping taxis and Private Hire Car driversA $77-milion package willhelp taxi and Private Hire Car drivers through this uncertain period.It’s a co-funded package – with the Government funding $45 million, and taxi and private-hire companies paying for the rest.All main taxi hirers will receive $20 in their hiring account each day. Active Private Hire Car drivers will also be eligible for this package. This benefits some 40,000 drivers in Singapore.5. Support for F&B establishmentsThe National Environment Agency will be providing a full month of rental waiver to stallholders in NEA-managed hawker centres and markets.Other Government agencies, like HDB, will provide half a month of rental waiver to its commercial tenants.6. Help for employers affected by Leave of Absence and Stay-Home NoticesSingapore residents and Long-term pass holders returning from Mainland China (outside of Hubei) are issueda Stay-Home Notice of 14 days.The Government acknowledges that such a requirement can cause inconvenience to Singapore companies.As such, eligible employers will be able to apply for the Leave of Absence Support Programme.It gives the employer $100 daily per affected worker for the duration of the LOA. From 18 Feb 2359hr, this will be extended to those affected by the Stay-Home Notice requirement.Eligible self-employed persons can also apply for the $100 daily.', 'id': '41adff09-9b2c-4b32-9b82-010d0a922989', 'score': None, 'probability': None, 'question': None, 'meta': {'category': 'articles'}, 'embedding': None},\n",

In other words, all dormitories will be COVID-cleared, with the exception of several standalone blocks which serve as quarantine facilities.Workers in these quarantine facilities will be tested when their isolation ends. Case counts will remain high.After completing their isolation, most of the workers will be able to resume work, as soon as dormitory operators and their employers complete the necessary preparations to do so in a safe manner.With the completion of dormitory clearance, and facilitation of resumption of work by sector agencies, the vast majority of dormitory residents is expected to be able to resume work by mid- to late August.---The circuit breaker measures so far have helped to substantially reduce COVID-19 infections, with the number of new cases in the community falling to 8 new cases daily, as of 12 May.Progress has been made in controlling the outbreak in the migrant worker dormitories: Number of workers from dormitories reporting sick daily has dropped 1,735 migrant workers have recovered and been discharged As many as 20,000 workers may be ready for discharge by the end of May Systematic clearance of dormsAs of 12 May, more than 32,000 migrant workers have been tested and more than 3,000 workers are tested daily. In anticipation of measures being eased after the circuit breaker period ends, there is a need to ensure the health of all migrant workers before they return to work. Hence, the Multi-Ministry Taskforce has in place a plan to systematically test all workers in the dormitories.

       " {'text': 'singapores largest active covid 19 cluster what went wrong at changi airport Read 3 articles daily and stand to win ST rewards, including the ST News Tablet worth $398. Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - In less than a month, the Covid-19 cluster at Changi Airport has swelled to more than 100 people, including airport workers whose jobs did not require them to interact with passengers, family members of front-line staff and visitors. It is now the largest active cluster in Singapore, and accounts for four of the 30 new community cases reported on Friday (May 21). Stringent measures - including strict limits on social gatherings and proactive testing of airport staff - are currently in place to ring-fence the cluster and prevent further transmission in the wider community. But how did Singapore land itself in this situation? In early April, Covid-19 cases in India began to rise, leading to questions being raised about whether Singapore should take pre-emptive measures to stop flights from the country. On April 22, the country announced it would ban all long-term pass holders and short-term visitors who had travelled to India in the past 14 days. A week later, these restrictions were extended to four neighbouring countries: Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. But by then, the new, more transmissible B1617 strain had already made significant inroads here. As an outward-looking country with a globalised economy, highly dependent on workers from abroad for several key industries, Singapore took \"the strategic decision to remain open as long as possible\", noted Associate Professor Natasha Howard from the National University of Singapore\\'s Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health. It was therefore to be expected that some cases would be imported even with rigorous border control measures, given how differently the virus has been controlled in many countries, she said. In other words, cutting off flights from high-risk countries would simply have delayed the inevitable, said Associate Professor Jeremy Lim, also from the Saw Swee Hock School. Even so, this delay could have been crucial in \"bolstering the bulwarks\", Prof Lim added. \"Could we have closed off for a short period, to review and tighten our defences?\" Associate Professor Hsu Li Yang, vice-dean of global health at the school, also pointed out that the World Health Organisation and other agencies classified the B1617 strain as a variant of concern only in early May, after the infections in Singapore had occurred. \"I think hindsight is 20/20 here,\" he said. \"Although the overwhelming outbreak in India - and perhaps more importantly, the displacement of all other variants in India by this variant - would have signalled that greater caution was necessary here.\" Phylogenetic test results from an initial batch of infected airport workers found that they had the B1617 variant, and were similar enough that they pointed to a common source of infection. Early signs suggest that this initial transmission could have occurred through an airport worker who had assisted a family from South Asia, said the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore and Changi Airport Group in a joint statement on Friday (May 21). The family later tested positive for the virus. It remains unclear exactly how the virus subsequently spread to other workers and members of the public, although doctors have pointed to the air-conditioned environment as a possible contributing factor. Some infected workers having their meals in the Terminal 3 foodcourt could also have exposed other diners to the virus. In addition, the airport has segregated the immigration halls, baggage belts and toilets used by incoming passengers from different risk categories, suggesting that these areas may also be suspect. As the more transmissible Covid-19 variants appear able to spread in such enclosed spaces despite existing infection prevention and control protocols, these measures may need to be enhanced, Prof Howard said. It is also possible that the current polymerase chain reaction tests may not have picked up some infections caused by virus variants, added infectious diseases expert Paul Tambyah, president of the Asia Pacific Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infection. \"That may have contributed to silent transmission by people who may have tested negative, but had actually been infected,\" he said. The discomfort of working long hours in personal protective equipment - including N95 masks, face shields and medical gowns and gloves - may also have increased the likelihood of lapses in infection control measures, said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, another infectious diseases expert from Rophi Clinic. \"I have trouble myself... Wearing full headgear without a break is extremely challenging,\" he said. \"Hence, implementation and practicality is a big concern.\" All the experts stressed the importance of vaccination in helping to keep cases mild and the cluster under control, with Professor Teo Yik Ying, dean of the Saw Swee Hock School, summing it up as follows: \"I believe the outbreak among airport front-line workers would be bigger, if not for the fact that many of these workers have already been vaccinated.\" What can Singapore now do to plug the gaps in its defences that the Changi Airport cluster has revealed? First, employers should ensure that front-line workers are properly trained and equipped for their tasks. Unvaccinated staff should also be redeployed to less risky environments, especially if they are elderly. \"We would not send partially or untrained soldiers into battle,\" Prof Lim said. \"The parallel here would be whether our front-line staff - like airline staff, cleaners and immigration officers - are adequately trained and resourced for the pivotal roles they play.\" Importantly, such workers should have access to \"good quality standardised occupational health services which encourage them to get tested for all infectious diseases\", Prof Tambyah added. In particular, they should be able to take medical leave without being penalised, he said. Next, those reviewing the cluster should look beyond the individual, scrutinising instead the complex systems involved in stopping viruses from spreading. As the healthcare sector has learnt, the design and engineering of buildings and work processes are equally important as, if not more than, the individual\\'s role in preventing infection, Prof Hsu said. Lastly, Singapore has to remain open to the fact that new gaps will emerge, and be poised to adapt quickly to these challenges. Dr Arpana Vidyarthi, an academic hospitalist with the University of California in San Francisco, pointed out that blind spots exist and will continually evolve. \"Our systems are complex and adaptive - we fix one hole, and another reveals itself,\" said Dr Vidyarthi, an American specialist physician who worked in leadership positions at Duke-NUS Medical School and the National University Hospital for eight years before returning to the United States. \"The key is to expect them, keep fixing them, and continually search for new ones.\" Although the new variants are more transmissible, they are not impenetrable, she said, adding that Singapore has one of the most advanced public health infrastructures in the world. \"Trust the experts, there are many of them.\" Added Prof Teo: \"Despite the best planning and forward planning, there will be new gaps that emerge and we will need to remain agile.\" This is why the country has not eased off on measures such as mask wearing and social distancing, and continues to encourage Singaporeans to work from home to some degree, he said. \"We know that there will be the inevitable spillovers from time to time, and we need to minimise the chance that these spillovers result in an uncontrollable community outbreak.\" Join ST\\'s Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.

       " {'text': 'one week into new phase 2 restrictions fb among the worst hit sectors Read 3 articles daily and stand to win ST rewards, including the ST News Tablet worth $398. Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - One week into the tightened restrictions that kicked in on May 16 for food & beverage (F&B) outlets, it is deja vu for the owners of newly opened eateries Asador Singaporein Joo Chiat Place, and Low Tide in Club Street. Their barely two-week-old venues are already forced to go into a takeaway or delivery-only model, with no dining in allowed under the new phase two rules. And it is a repeat of what happened to the owners around this time last year. Asador is the second venue after Next Door Spanish Cafe for co-founders Houssein Rodriguez and Joseba Madina, both 33;while Low Tide owners Jay Gray, 31, Desiree Jane Silva, 34, Abhishek Cherian George, 35, and Joseph Haywood 35, had earlier opened Sago House. Next Door Spanish Cafe in Siglap opened just a few weeks before the circuit breaker, while dive bar Sago House in Chinatown started with home deliveries on the second day after the restrictions kicked in last year. But their first venues not only survived the circuit breaker -which was from April 7 to June 1 last year -but thrived, enough for them to consider expanding this year. But with two venues each now, and fixed costs like rent, the situation seems more bleak this time. \"We decided to open Asador as we had a captive audience in Singapore with people who can\\'t travel... so we wanted to open as soon as possible and take advantage of the situation,\" said Mr Rodriguez, a Spaniard who has been here for more than nine years. Now they have consolidated kitchen operations for both restaurants at Asador, and do 20 to 25 deliveries a dayand up to 40 on the weekend. But it is barely enough to cover costs. \"We don\\'t have any big investors... we put in all our own money, our savings. Right now, we are able to survive until the end of the month, if not I need to find another line of cash flow,\" added Mr Rodriguez, who has a total of 40 employees at the two venues. It is a similar case for the people at Low Tide - a dual-level bar and eatery concept that offers food and Tiki-style drinks on the upper floor, and food in a speakeasy bar on the lower floor. \"It\\'s harder this time because not only are we on a prime site like a corner shophouse in Club Street with higher overheads, it is fully staffed with a team of eight that we hired before we opened,\" said its co-founder Mr Gray, who is British. They also have a staff of seven at Sago House to look after. \"We barely had the chance to get the word out and we are already expecting to see losses within our first month of operations,\" he said. \"There are suppliers and staff who need to be paid, and if this goes on for three months, we will need to look at refunding the business.\" While several other sectors such as gyms,education and enrichment centres are feeling the pinch while being forced to close or operate under tightened measures, the F&B sector is seen as being among the worst hit. \"Aside from taxis and private-hire drivers and tuition centres, in particular, we expect players in hospitality to be the hardest hit,\" said KPMG in Singapore partner and economist Paul Kent. \"Supermarkets are likely to remain resilient because any businesses selling household products with available online channels are always going to be in demand. This is similar to what we saw last year.\" Even when F&B businesses were able to pivot quickly, having learnt from last year\\'s circuit breaker, business is not as brisk. A spokesman for the Restaurant Association of Singapore (RAS) said F&B concepts across the board saw reduced sales of between 40 per cent and 90 per cent over the first few days of tightened restrictions under phase two. \"This time around, many of our members are more prepared, and managed to switch gears more quickly to the food-delivery mode,\" said RAS. \"However, this does not necessarily result in the increase infood delivery salesas consumers also have more options this time round, resulting in spreading consumption across a much broader base, and thinning revenues for each F&B brand.\" Several restaurants The Straits Times spoke to are already feeling the effects of this. \"The sales from takeaways and deliveries can never match the sales of dine-in customers, and it is not even 20 per cent of the sales we used to make,\" said Mrs Nagajyothi Mahendran, director of Indian restaurant Samy\\'s Curry in Dempsey. Sales on weekdays have plummeted. \"Even if more people order delivery on weekends , we are not really seeing much profit because of the commission cut that needs to be shared with delivery partners,\" she added. At Old Bibik\\'s Peranakan Kitchen in Joo Chiat, director Adrian Loh said business had dropped by almost 70 per cent. \"We used to do at least $1,000 to $1,200 per weekday, but in the last few days, sales have averaged $300 per day, including sales via our online platforms (including our website and delivery platforms).\" Hawkers and coffee shop operators have also been severely hit, and have experienced a 50 per cent to 70 per cent dip in sales, according to the Federation of Merchants\\' Associations, Singapore (FMAS). Not all are able to pivot to deliveries. \"Senior hawkers and wet market owners who are not tech savvy are suffering the most,\" said FMAS president Yeo Hiang Meng. \"We hope the government will send more digital ambassadors to help them, while our subsidiary, Heartland Enterprise Centre Singapore, is trying to assist them as much as it can.\" Among the affected hawkers is Madam Ngern Kah Cheng, 72, who has been running a duck noodle stall in Tanglin Halt for 52 years. With very few customers coming by, she has been preparing about 30 per cent to 40 per cent less food per day. She also closes her shop half an hour earlier than usual, and has told her hired help to stop coming to the stall. Despite the fall in customers, Madam Ngern said she still has loyal customers who come to her stall for takeaway. \"I\\'m thankful for their support,\" she said. \"Finances do not affect me that much, I\\'m happy enough to have work to do and food to eat.\" Businesses, however, could be forced to take drastic measures if the restrictions extend beyond the projected end date of June 13. Already, Mr Rodriguez of Asador and Next Door Spanish Cafe is encouraging his staff to clear their annual leave during this period. \"As a company rule, I don\\'t want to fire anyone... we will need everyone once dine-in starts again,\" he said. \"I believe what we do is a good product, so I want to be ready to reopen.\" Mr Gray of Low Tide and Sago House is also adamant about his commitment to keeping his staff, and is instead working on sharpening their skills and foundation in cocktail knowledge and hospitality for now. \"But once this has subsided, it\\'s going to be a struggle for us... it\\'s going to be a long climb back up to the start line,\" he added.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - A breath test that can accurately detect Covid-19 within a minute will be rolled out in Singapore, with a trial slated to begin at Tuas Checkpoint in the next few days. Developed by Breathonix, a spin-off from the National University of Singapore, this breath test system has received provisional authorisation from Singapore\\'s Health Sciences Authority (HSA), the first such system to receive it here. This was announced on Monday (May 24) in a joint statement by Breathonix and NUS. Using these breathalysers will enable Covid-19 testing to be done much faster and more efficiently, without the need for the samples to be processed elsewhere. Trained personnel will administer the test, with no need for medically trained staff. Breathonix is now working with the Ministry of Health for its deployment trial at Tuas Checkpoint, where incoming travellers will be screened. This breath analysis will be carried out alongside the current compulsory Covid-19 antigen rapid test. Antigen rapid tests produce results in around 30 minutes and can be done on site. Meanwhile, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, considered to be the gold standard for testing, take a few hours. Swabs for PCR tests also have to be transported to labs. For the new BreFence Go Covid-19 Breath Test System, people simply exhale into a disposable one-way valved mouthpiece that is connected to a breath sampler. A mass spectrometer analyses the invisible particles called volatile organic compounds (VOC) in a person\\'s exhaled breath. A healthy person will have a different VOC signature from someone who is ill, and different illnesses produce different signatures. The total time from breath sampling to results takes less than a minute. Any individual with a positive breathalyser result will need to undergo a confirmatory PCR swab test. Dr Jia Zhunan, chief executive of Breathonix, said: \"Our breath test is non-invasive. Users only need to breathe out normally into the disposable mouthpiece provided, so there will not be any discomfort.\" She added: \"Cross-contamination is unlikely as the disposable mouthpiece has a one-way valve and a saliva trap to prevent inhalation or saliva from entering the machine.\" The breath analysis system underwent clinical trials at three locations conducted from June 2020 to April 2021. Locally, trials were carried out at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases and Changi Airport while the third trial was carried out in Dubai, in collaboration with the Dubai Health Authority and the Mohammed Bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences. Breathonix is in discussion with several local and overseas organisations to use the system, given its strong commercial interest. Breathonix is founded by three NUS graduates -Dr Jia, Mr Du Fang and Mr Wayne Wee -along with Professor T. Venky Venkatesan. It is supported by the NUS Graduate Research Innovation Programme (Grip), a scheme that encourages talented NUS graduate students and research staff to establish and run high potential start-ups based on deep technologies. Professor Freddy Boey, deputy president (innovation and enterprise), who oversees the NUS Grip team, said: \"Securing provisional authorisation in Singapore is a major milestone for Breathonix, and NUS is very proud of this achievement by our start-up. \"The pandemic is likely to go on for several years. Mass, repeated testing has to be widely adopted as a key public health strategy to support the safe reopening of economies, and Breathonix\\'s home-grown technology hits the right spot. \"I\\'m confident that their novel technology will make a significant contribution towards protecting the safety and health of Singaporeans and the global community,\" he added.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - Singapore\\'sMinistry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) on Wednesday (May 19) said it was \"disappointed\"that a prominent Indian political figure like Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had failed to ascertain facts before making claims about a \"new strain\" of Covid-19 found in Singapore. In a statement, the ministry said it \"regrets the unfounded assertions\" made on Facebook and Twitter by Mr Kejriwal, who claimed on Tuesday that a \"Singapore variant\" was particularly harmful to children and could cause a third wave of infections in India. \"MFA met the High Commissioner of India P. Kumaran this morning to express these concerns,\" said a spokesman. Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan quoted Mr Kejriwal\\'s original post in a tweet and said: \"Politicians should stick to facts! There is no \\'Singapore variant\\'.\" Dr Balakrishnan also included a link to a May 11 article in established science journal Nature, which explained how virus variants like B1617 have been dominant in India before spreading to about 40 nations, including Singapore. Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar tagged Dr Balakrishnan in a tweet that sought to clarify that Mr Kejriwal \"does not speak for India\". \"Singapore and India have been solid partners in the fight against Covid-19,\" wrote Dr Jaishankar. \"Appreciate Singapore\\'s role as a logistics hub and oxygen supplier. Their gesture of deploying military aircraft to help us speaks of our exceptional relationship. \"However, irresponsible comments from those who should know better can damage longstanding partnerships.\" Last month, Singapore sent to West Bengal 256 oxygen cylinders on board two C-130 planes. The Republic and several other countries have pitched in to help an overwhelmed India, which has registered more than25 million cases and 279,000 deaths as atWednesday morning. Dr Balakrishnan tweeted a note of thanks to his counterpart, saying: “Let’s focus on resolving the situation in our respective countries and helping one another. Nobody is safe until everyone is safe.” Indian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arindam Bagchi also tweeted to say that Mr Kumaran had clarified to MFA that Mr Kejriwal \"had no competence to pronounce on Covid variants or civil aviation policy\". Mr Kejriwal\\'s original Twitter post, in Hindi, had also called on India\\'s government to cancel flights with Singapore. \"The new form of corona that came to Singapore is being said to be extremely dangerous for children; in India, it may come as a third wave. My appeal to the central government is for air services with Singapore to be cancelled with immediate effect and to prioritise the options for vaccinating children at the earliest,\" he wrote. Singapore\\'s Ministry of Health (MOH) issued a rebuttal shortly after, saying there is \"no truth whatsoever\" to the assertions. There is no \"Singapore variant\", an MOH spokesman said. \"The strain that is prevalent in many of the Covid-19 cases in recent weeks is the B16172 variant, which originated in India. Phylogenetic testing has shown this B16172 variant to be associated with several clusters in Singapore,\"the spokesman added. Late on Tuesday, Senior Minister of State for Transport Chee Hong Tat wrote on Facebook that it was \"disappointing to see such nonsense coming from Chief Minister Kejriwal\".

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - Veteran actor Terence Cao Guohui has admitted that he unlawfully hosted 12 guests at his home amid the Covid-19 outbreak last October and was fined $3,500 on Tuesday (May 25). Cao, 53, pleaded guilty to an offence under the Covid-19 (Temporary Measures) Act after hosting the party at his condominium apartment in Daisy Road, off Braddell Road. The Singaporean had breached phase two regulations that restricted social gatherings to no more than five people. He is the last person involved in this case to be convicted in court. One of the guests, former magazine editor Lance Lim Chee Keong, 50, who had invited four people to the gathering, was fined $3,000 last week over an offence under the same Act. The court heard that Cao had initially organised a gathering at his home for himself and five others last October. It was held to celebrate Cao\\'s birthday as well as those of two other artistes, Shane Pow Xun Ping, 30, and Jeffrey Xu Mingjie, 32. Lim later invited four more people and the total number of guests swelled to 12 as the celebrations progressed. The event received flak on social media after pictures of the unmasked group went viral online. Twelve guests were in the unit between 9pm on Oct 2 last year and 1am the following day. Among them were seven artistes - Julie Tan Shaoyin, 29; Sonia Nicola Chew, 30; Dawn Yeoh Yishan, 34; Jeremy Chan Ming Yuew, 39; Heng Tee Kok, 45; Pow and Xu. The five other guests were managers Tan Jun Chuan, 30; Debbie Lu Shuyi, 33; and Eleanor Wang Chunwei, 34; as well as part-time model Valnice Yek Jia Hui, 22, and Lim. Eleven of those in the gathering had earlier been fined $300 in lieu of being prosecuted due to their lower level of culpability. The celebrities have since apologised via Mediacorp, saying they \"deeply regret\" their actions. Following the incident, Chew was dropped from hosting Mediacorp\\'s annual countdown show. Pow, on the other hand, was handed an unrelated drink-driving charge last month, and Mediacorp has since terminated his contract. His case involving this charge is pending. On Tuesday, Deputy Public Prosecutor Norman Yew urged the court to sentence Cao to a fine of $3,500 - $500 more than Lim’s - to reflect the actor’s “increased culpability” as he was the host of the party. Defence lawyer S.S. Dhillon, however, pleaded for a lighter fine and added that it would have been “ethically wrong” for Cao to turn the guests away from his birthday celebration. Cao could not tell his guests to “get out of here”, said the lawyer. First-time offenders who breach laws under the Covid-19 (Temporary Measures) Act can be jailed for up to six months and fined up to $10,000. Repeat offenders can be jailed for up to a year and fined up to $20,000. Join ST\\'s Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - Many groups in Singapore have raised millions in aid in the form of cash and supplies for India as it battles a devastating Covid-19 wave. The Pan Indian Institutes of Management Alumni (PIIMA), an alumni association, has raised $5.4 million with the #BreatheLifeIntoIndia campaign launched on May 1. The amount raised includes $2.4 million in cash which will go towards the Singapore Red Cross (SRC) for purchasing 2,500 oxygen concentrators. The remaining $3 million is in the form of material aid. Individual donors, comprising mainly Indian Institute of Management (IIM) alumni, contributed the bulk of the cash portion, at $1.6 million. The remaining $800,000 came from corporate donors approached by PIIMA. Through the campaign, PIIMA also helped in the acquisition of medical supplies for India by identifying suppliers, negotiating prices and coordinating with various entities for the purchase of oxygen cylinders and oxygen concentrators for partners includingACT Grants - a non-governmental organisation that handles last-mile distribution in India -Temasek Foundation and the Indian High Commission. Among other things, theyenabled the shipment of 6,300 oxygen cylinders and eight Pressure Swing Absorption (PSA) plants. Mr Benjamin William, chief executive and secretary-general of the SRC, said: \"This collaboration has helped to accelerate the delivery of equipment to India by the Singapore Red Cross. The Singapore IIM alumni team has brought value beyond just raising funds and we are grateful for this collaboration.\" Coordinating with the India Red Cross, SRC is managing the last-mile distribution of oxygen concentrators funded and sourced by PIIMA. PIIMA said its volunteer sourcing team worked across its alumni network to place orders with trusted suppliers, organise logistics, make quality checks and get last-mile delivery organised. The community leveraged its networks to identify supply sources within Singapore, Malaysia, China, Taipei and Turkey. Mr Suresh Shankar, president of PIIMA, said: \"(The alumni community) opened their wallets and their networks, but also gave the most precious asset in this crisis - their managerial time.\" Other organisations have also helped to raise funds for India. The Indus Entrepreneurs (TiE) Singapore, the local chapter of the global TiE community and the largest global entrepreneur and investor foundation, has led a Mission India campaign that has raised US$2.2 million (S$2.93 million), more than double its target of US$1 million through the \"I Breathe For India\"celebrity fund-raiser. The Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industrydonated $50,000 to the India Covid Relief Fund steered by the Singapore Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and Little India Shopkeepers Association.

SINGAPORE - The death of a 57-year-old man the day after he took his first Covid-19 jab on March 5 was due to a heart attack, and was not linked to the vaccine, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Monday (May 24). In response to queries from The Straits Times, MOH said it was alerted on March 8 by the National University Hospital (NUH)to the death of the Singaporean patient, who had been treated at the hospital\\'s emergency medicine departmenton the evening of March 6. He had received his first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine on March 5. \"Based on the assessment by an independent clinical panel, there is no indication that the death was due to Covid-19 vaccination,\" said MOH. The ministry added that the certified cause of death was a heart attack, and the man had a history of hypertension and diabetes. MOH said the man was assessed by trained healthcare personnel to be suitable for vaccination, and he was observed on-site for about 30 minutes after getting the shot. \"We offer our sincere condolences to the family during this difficult time,\" the ministry added. MOH said that to date, there has not been any deaths in Singapore assessed to be caused by the Covid-19 vaccine. Online news outletToday reported on Sundaythat the man, named Yak Hock Hwa, a private-hire car driver, collapsedonMarch 6 evening. NUH told the news outlet that the man\\'s condition deteriorated rapidly and he did not respond to resuscitation efforts. The man\\'s family told Today that he had no history of heart problems, and they are hoping the authorities can provide further explanations on how they assessed that his death was not caused by the vaccine. They are also hoping to receive compensation from the Vaccine Injury Financial Assistance Programme - a one-time goodwill payout for those who suffer from serious side effects linked to the vaccine. The news outlet also reported that the family declined an autopsy into his death because the NUH doctors were confident that the man died of a heart attack.

SINGAPORE - There are 78 vaccinated individuals who have been infected with Covid-19 in the current outbreak in Singapore, compared with about 300 unvaccinated cases, Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said on Sunday (May 23). This means close to 80 per cent of recent cases involve those who have not been vaccinated. Many of the vaccinated cases are front-line workers, Mr Ong noted. \"International studies continue to show that vaccinations are very effective in preventing infections and severe illnesses,\" he stressed in a Facebook post on Sunday, debunking the notion that there is no point in getting inoculated as many vaccinated people are infected. The minister also addressed what he said were the most common questions people are asking about Covid-19 in Singapore, including whether the recent testing operations at Housing Board blocks mean the outbreak must be bad. \"No,\" Mr Ong wrote. \"Testing is a very effective way to prevent further spread. You should feel safer when you hear (about) all these testing ops. \"They help us detect and isolate people early, including persons who are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic and would otherwise be missed.\" The authorities will be doing even more testing and surveillance moving forward, he added. He made the point that Singapore\\'s three-day moving average of total community cases has been hovering around the same number - close to 30 - since May 16. The same average for unlinked community cases was 7.7 on May 16, rose to 12 on May 18 and then fell to six on May 21. \"We are monitoring the situation closely, to see if we are trending up, down or flat,\" he said. On the B1617 variant of the virus being airborne and very contagious, Mr Ong noted that Covid-19 has always been spread when a person coughs, sneezes, talks or sings, through droplets and aerosols in the air.

       " {'text': 'ring fencing intensified to avoid a second circuit breaker here Read 3 articles daily and stand to win ST rewards, including the ST News Tablet worth $398. Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. Ring-fencing strategies that aim to limit Covid-19 transmissions and contain their spread have been intensified recently, helping Singapore stave off a second circuit breaker for now. Experts note that larger areas are now being closed off and more people made to undergo swab testing. Professor Teo Yik Ying, dean of the National University of Singapore\\'s (NUS) Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, said that ring-fencing can help to flatten the curve of infections by preventing transmissions from spilling over to other sectors. \"It is a form of sectoral lockdown so that all the people within a location or sector can minimise further interactions with the public,\" he said, adding that it allows the authorities to understand the extent of the outbreak in that area. However, it has to be executed promptly upon the discovery of cases, said Prof Teo, though the speed of execution is relative to how fast transmissions can occur. \"This depends on the extent of human-to-human interactions, personal safe management measures and the characteristics of the coronavirus infection, such as whether infected cases have high viral loads,\" he said. Ring-fencing was used in 2003 amid the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak, with close contacts of patients quarantined at home. More recently, the approach was used in Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) with some success. When a 46-year-old nurse followed by a few patients in Ward 9D were diagnosed with Covid-19, the hospital moved quickly to close the ward. It expanded the ring fence when it emerged that there was potential exposure to these confirmed cases in other parts of the hospital. By April 30, three days after the first infection was reported, the hospital had locked down four wards. On May 4, it stopped admitting new patients. All close contacts were placed on quarantine, with TTSH staff and patients in the affected areas tested. There was also increased clinical surveillance of all patients who developed fever and acute respiratory infection symptoms, and deep cleaning was conducted. Close to 28,000 people were tested for Covid-19, including 12,000 TTSH staff and 1,000 patients, as well as close to 2,500 individuals who were quarantined following contact tracing. Contact tracing, mandatory testing and deep cleaning are carried out for areas that are ring-fenced, followed by monitoring and heightened vigilance, said Professor Josip Car, director of the Centre for Population Health Science at Nanyang Technological University\\'s Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine. But he noted that Singapore\\'s ring-fencing strategy has been tweaked since last year. \"The areas being ring-fenced are now bigger for each potential outbreak. For instance, last year, outbreaks in schools first started with classes or levels being ring-fenced, but this year, the response is swifter and wider,\" he said. Last July, then Education Minister Ong Ye Kung said his ministry\\'s approach was to ring-fence schools on a small scale, and to put students and staff on leave of absence instead of fully closing schools. The approach was to close a class to keep the school safe and, if need be, the school. But amid the current surge which has seen more children across several schools infected this year than last year, the ministry moved schools to home-based learning from May 19 to May 28. On Friday night, the Education Ministry reported the first case of school-based transmission - a second student of Anglo-Chinese School (Junior) had tested positive for Covid-19, after his classmate had done so on May 19. When multiple areas are concurrently affected, Prof Car said broader measures covering larger areas may be needed to stem or slow the spread. This would also require the co-operation of those who were potentially exposed to the virus to go for testing, and to see a doctor if they develop any symptoms, he added. Take White Sands shopping mall, which was listed 14 times on the Health Ministry\\'s list of locations visited by Covid-19 community cases during their infectious period. The authorities moved to get people who visited the mall from May 2 to May 11 tested. Through the TraceTogether app and token, close contacts were identified and notified by SMS. However, a more aggressive approach was taken for residents of Block 506 Hougang Avenue 8, after a number of residents there tested positive. For the first time, it was made mandatory for all 116 households to get tested. Prof Car said that in scenarios of limited transmissions, locking down areas not exposed to the source of the virus could overstretch resources and may not be more effective than ring-fencing in breaking the chain of transmissions. \"Whole-country lockdowns may be necessary, but only in the event of many localised outbreaks or uncontrolled spread where contact tracing resources are overstretched,\" he said, adding that Singapore has been following this playbook and extending the ring-fence outwards when needed. As at yesterday, Singapore has had over 90 unlinked local Covid-19 cases reported since May 7, compared with a total of 68 unlinked cases reported from the start of the year till before the spike. Associate Professor Hsu Li Yang, an infectious diseases expert from the NUS Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, said: \"If unlinked cases start appearing in the majority of sectors in the economy, it will probably trigger a more general lockdown.\" Agreeing, Prof Car said that these unlinked cases signal leakages from containment areas, and could be a result of higher infectivity of the new viral strain, rather than the non-effectiveness of the localised ring-fencing strategy. Prof Teo said: \"If the pace and scale of the spillover is so great that the contact tracing and ring-fencing are basically trying to play catch-up, then a complete lockdown becomes the only viable option to arrest the growth of the outbreak in the community.\" Join ST\\'s Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.

When news broke that Singapore was further tightening rules from Sunday (May 16)to limit social gatherings to just two people, halt all dining in at eateries and get employees to work from home, memories of the circuit breaker (CB) period last year came flooding back. Never mind that most schools remain open and you can still watch a movie or attend a concert, though audiences will be smaller. Some people still decided it was time to rush to the stores to stock up on groceries and household goods for the phase which some have dubbed mini-CB and CB-lite. The new measures have come amid Singapore\\'s largest active cluster at Changi Airport growing to 59 cases and an increase in unlinked Covid-19 cases in the community. The second-biggest cluster at Tan Tock Seng Hospital has 44 cases. The Republic is experiencing its worst spate of locally transmitted Covid-19 cases in close to a year, and mass testing is ongoing. But it seems that the fear of being stuck at home with no toilet paper or familiar food items is more immediate than being infected with the virus. In April last year, Singapore announced a \"major circuit breaker\" to break the chain of Covid-19 transmission and prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed after cases surged, clusters formed at migrant workers\\' dormitories and a cluster was discovered at a nursing home. People could go out only for essential services, with most working from home. The Government halted dining in at eateries, closed recreation venues and attractions, and moved schools to full home-based learning. All social gatherings with people not within the same household had to stop, and people were asked to exercise alone or with those they lived with. The circuit breaker exacted a heavy toll on the economy and people. The virus was new and spreading fast, there were no known treatments or vaccines, and tests were still being developed. Today, all that has changed, but as the recent surge in cases has shown, human behaviour plays a pivotal role in the battle against the virus. Vaccines are but one strategy, as public health measures still need to be adhered to. Singapore cannot afford to shut out the rest of the world for long. As cases rise and clusters form, the Government will ring-fence them quickly. Last year, Singapore locked down migrant workers\\' dormitories to prevent the spread of the virus. This year, after clusters formed in Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) and Changi Airport, the Government moved to conduct aggressive testing, contact tracing and deep cleaning, among other things. The hospital also ceased to take in new patients, while a two-week closure of Jewel and restricted access to Terminals 1, 2 and 3 from Thursday was announced. Social gatherings were whittled down from groups of eight to five, and now to two. Meanwhile, indoor gyms and fitness studios had to close. Tests done show that both the TTSH and Changi Airport clusters are associated with the coronavirus variant first detected in India that now accounts for half of the world\\'s Covid-19 cases and 30 per cent of the deaths caused by the disease, according to the World Health Organisation. The \"big worry now\" is the onward community transmission coming out of the commercial areas of Terminal 3, said Mr Ong Ye Kung, who assumes the role of Health Minister today and is co-chair of the multi-ministry task force on Covid-19. Mr Lawrence Wong, who assumes the role of Finance Minister today and who is also a co-chair of the task force, has said that the new variants appear to be more infectious and form larger clusters. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, in a Facebook post, said that the new clusters and unlinked community cases in the past fortnight are \"very worrying\". \"Please stay at home as far as possible, go out only for essential tasks and follow government advisories,\" he wrote. But some people are more lax now when it comes to social distancing, mask wearing and personal hygiene practices. They sit closer to one another in cafes and small eateries, and enter lifts when there are already several people inside. The free hand sanitiser at lift lobbies and shops is now often ignored. Yes, we have TraceTogether, increased testing capability and vaccinated people among us. But vaccination does not remove the risk of infection, though it can prevent people from becoming severely ill with Covid-19. Guarding against the coronavirus may remain a part of life for a long time, with the virus mutating as it spreads. So, we will have to adapt, be it by taking booster shots if needed or doing more tests. As PM Lee said, if we all play our part and look out for one another, we will succeed in stemming the transmission of the virus, just like we did last year. Singapore is at a critical point in this latest round of the battle against Covid-19. By now, surely, we all know what we must do.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - Singapore cannot afford to slacken in its effort to keep Covid-19 in check as the virus will rear its head in new and unimaginable ways, said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. While the country has kept its number of Covid-19 deaths low at 31 and is in a stable position, it is \"far from out of the woods\",with a fresh superspreading cluster leading to tightened restrictions and gathering rules again, he added. \"Each time you think you have got the Covid-19 situation under control, and you know how to respond to it, it pops up in a new direction,\" he said. \"It can be a mutant, it can be a new avenue which you did not spot, but you cannot afford to slacken, and you must always think beyond what you imagine is likely to happen.\" PM Lee was speakingon Wednesday (May 19) at the US Chamber of Commerce\\'s inaugural Global Forum on Economic Recovery, which brings together government and business leaders to discuss opportunities and barriers to global recovery. In a virtual fireside chat with US Chamber executive vice-president Myron Brilliant, he said Singapore\\'s prior experience with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) in 2003 helped it handle the coronavirus pandemic. \"That primed our system to gear up for a next new disease, and primed our population to understand what was at stake and what kind of collective responses we needed,\" he said. There were 38 new Covid-19 cases reported in Singaporeas at noon on Wednesday, including 34 in the community, taking Singapore\\'s total to 61,689. The pandemic also reminded everyone of the importance of international cooperation, which has largely held up, added PMLee. \"There was a scramble for PPE (personal protective equipment) at the beginning, there is a scramble for vaccine doses now, but internationally, supply chains have not broken down. You can still buy iPhones made in any number of countries, you can still buy cars, which require parts from many continents.\" He noted that the world has not taken \"giant strides towards autarky\", meaning \"total self-reliance\". Nor can a small and open country such as Singapore afford to seal its borders off. \"Protectionism? Yes. Autarky? No. That is a qualified plus. \"Other bigger countries can (close their borders), to a very great extent. For Singapore, you need food, fuel, people moving in and out, even during Covid-19. You have to do it to the extent that you can, while keeping ourselves safe with all the precautions... Not without risk, but unavoidable.\" PMLee also said it would be a long way off before countries can open up completely again and have free travel. While countries talk about travel bubbles, this needs confidence on both sides, and Singaporewants to set up bubbles only with countries which are safer than itself, he added. \"That means it is not easy to make a match. But I hope that as societies get vaccinated, and as confidence returns and the disease gets brought under control, that will be possible.\" The air travel bubble to allow for quarantine-free travel between Singapore and Hong Kong was deferred for a second time on Monday, after a spike in cases here. PMLee said that globally, it is not just India that is in a very difficult spot now, but also Latin America and even Africa, where many have not been vaccinated, though the number of reported cases are low. \"We are very anxious that what has happened to the rest of the world will not befall Africa too, which would have consequences not just on that continent.\" Stressing the need for global cooperation to mitigate supply chain disruptions, he warned that it would be \"very harmful\" for every country to make everything onshore. While there is greater desire to have more resilience, if that goes too far, the price will be very high, he said. \"You can have the final assembly of your devices in your own country, but to make all the components yourself is a stretch. And to get all the raw materials yourself, in most cases, it is going to be impossible. \"You cannot even make vaccines all by yourself. You do need not just the raw materials, but also the bottles, the bottle stoppers, all sorts of things which come from all around the world.\" He said he was happy that the current US administration is re-engaging with the World Trade Organisation (WTO), and urged the US to work multilaterally with more partners to establish trust and rules that apply to everyone. \"The WTO has weaknesses, but we should work together to remedy and strengthen the WTO, not to marginalise and cast it aside. \"That is at the top level, but there will be many other areas of cooperation regionally.\" Join ST\\'s Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.

       " {'text': 'sg hk travel bubble deferred again after covid 19 cases spike in singapore Read 3 articles daily and stand to win ST rewards, including the ST News Tablet worth $398. Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - The air travel bubble (ATB) to allow for quarantine-free travel between Singapore and Hong Kong will be delayed again, after a spike in Covid-19 cases in Singapore. Both cities had said the air travel bubble - which was due to take off on May 26 - would be suspended when the seven-day moving average of unlinked community cases in either Singapore or Hong Kong increases to more than five. As at Monday, the seven-day moving average of unlinked community cases in Singapore hadincreased to six. There have also been dozens of other linked cases reported in the community in the past week. The Ministry of Transport (MOT) said on Monday (May 17) that Transport Minister S. Iswaran had a meeting in the morning with Hong Kong Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Edward Yau on the issue. \"Both sides remain strongly committed to launching the ATB safely,\" said MOT. \"However, in the light of the recent increase in unlinked community cases, Singapore is unable to meet the criteria to start the Singapore-Hong Kong ATB.\" Both sides have therefore agreed to defer the launch of the ATB to protect the health of travellers and the public in these two places, MOT added. It said the two cities will monitor the public health situation and review the new launch date of the ATB towards the end of phase two (heightened alert) of Singapore\\'s reopening. MOT said airlines will contact affected passengers to offer help. Travellers can still continue on their trips to Hong Kong on non-ATB flights. But this means that they will face more stringent health and border restrictions in both cities, such as a seven-day stay-home notice when they return to Singapore. In a Facebook post, Mr Iswaran acknowledged that many have been looking to travel under the ATB for various reasons. “I seek your understanding as this is the unpredictable nature of the pandemic,” he said. A Hong Kong government spokesman said on Monday that both cities will also monitor the effectiveness of more stringent Covid-19 measures implemented in Singapore since Sunday. The measures, such as a ban ondining out, will stay in place till June 13. “During this period, both sides will continue to maintain communication, exchange relevant data and statistics, and review developments closely before deciding on the way forward with the inaugural flights under the ATB,” said the Hong Kong spokesman. “A further announcement will be made on or before June 13.” The bubble was slated to take off on May 26, six months after its initial planned launch on Nov 22 last year. It was first deferred last year by both parties owing to the worsening Covid-19 situation in Hong Kong. Former transport minister Ong Ye Kung, who is now health minister, had said last Fridaythat both cities are strongly committed to the bubble, but have to start it safely. They would also respect the resumption mechanisms that both sides had agreed on. Mr Aaron Wong, 33, who had made bookings for both rounds of planned air travel bubble flights, said the suspension was disappointing but understandable given the worsening Covid-19 situation in Singapore. The founder of frequent flier website MileLion said that even if the bubble had been launched as planned, Hong Kong tourists coming to Singapore would not have much to do owing to restrictions such as a cap on social gatherings and a ban on dining out. Hong Kong’s residents may also feel uneasy about an influx of Singapore visitors, he added. “When the revised ATB launch date is announced, I will make bookings again, with the hope that third time’s the charm,” Mr Wong said. “Of course, you take sensible precautions, such as ensuring all your flight/hotel bookings are fully refundable. It also helps if you go in with the mindset that actually travelling is a bonus.” The share price of national carrier Singapore Airlines, which was due to operate half of the ATB flights, rose 3.11 per cent to close at $4.64, despite the news of the suspension of the bubble.

       " {'text': 'why some continue to suffer covid 19 symptoms after recovery Read 3 articles daily and stand to win ST rewards, including the ST News Tablet worth $398. Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. Many who survive Covid-19 find themselves confronted with another challenge - recovering from \"long Covid\", which involves residual symptoms such as fatigue and chest pain weeks and months after the infection. The Straits Times delves into why this happens, how prevalent it is and if vaccination will alleviate any of the lingering symptoms. A: It is a condition where some people continue to experience Covid-19 symptoms for longer than usual, even after recovering from the infection. Fatigue, shortness of breath, chest pain, joint aches and \"brain fog\" - where one\\'s thinking is sluggish - are some of the commonly described problems that emerge or linger four weeks or more after an infection. Long Covid is a serious concern from a societal perspective, adding to the hidden toll of the pandemic years later, said Associate Professor Alex Cook, vice-dean of research at the National University of Singapore\\'s Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health. It justifies the strong measures taken to cut community transmission since the beginning of the pandemic and to prevent people from being infected in the first place. The prevalence has been estimated from about one in 10 to one in three cases, though the symptoms are quite diverse, and it is difficult to be sure how many people experience these symptoms and for how long, Prof Cook said. When Prof Cook and his team early this year interviewed recovered foreign workers who lived in dormitories, about 20 per cent of them reported still having side effects. This was more than six months after they had been infected in the middle of last year, when Singapore was battling outbreaks in workers\\' dormitories. Though data is slowly emerging, researchers have yet to study enough patients over a long duration to gauge the full range of long-term effects. If you have a question, e-mail us at askst@sph.com.sg \"There really is a pressing need to study the problem in depth and to alleviate any residual symptoms,\" Prof Cook said. A: The main reason behind Covid-19\\'s long tail is related to the autoimmune response of the body. When a patient is infected, he may develop an overactive immune response. The long-term side effects might be due to the body attacking itself, an issue that vaccination is unable to resolve. A large survey of more than 800 people has recently suggested that mRNA vaccines, in particular, are beneficial in alleviating long Covid. The analysis, which is yet to be peer-reviewed, was based on a survey conducted by advocacy group LongCovidSOS that involved 812 people with long Covid in Britain and internationally, The Guardian reported on Tuesday. Generally, the survey found that those who received mRNA vaccines, such as the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna jabs, reported greater improvements in symptoms than those who received an adenovirus vaccine, such as the AstraZeneca-Oxford jab. Researchers say more data and time are needed to get a full understanding of what happens in the long term when a vaccinated person is infected but displays only mild symptoms. A: Yes, it can happen with certain viral infections, such as the common cold, influenza, HIV, measles and hepatitis B. A Canadian study identified 21 healthcare workers from Toronto who had post-viral symptoms for as long as three years after being infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) in 2003 and were unable to return to their usual work. Some people who were hospitalised with Sars in Hong Kong still had impaired lung function two years later, a study of 55 patients published in medical journal Respirology in 2010 found. But it remains unclear whether this finding can be translated into what we know of Covid-19. Join ST\\'s Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - There were 28 new Covid-19 cases, including 21 in the community, as at noon on Monday (May 17), said the Ministry of Health (MOH). Of the community cases, 11 are currently unlinked.The remaining 10 are linked to previous cases. Of the new community patients, six had already been placed on quarantine. There were also seven imported cases who had been placed on stay-home notice on arrival in Singapore, said the ministry. Of these, two are returning Singaporeans or permanent residents. There were no new cases in the workers\\' dormitories. The new cases take Singapore\\'s total to 61,613. More details will be announced on Monday night. In a statement on Monday, Marina Bay Sands (MBS) announced that its casino will be closed temporarily for deep cleaning from noon after two casino staff were confirmed to have the virus on Sunday. \"Their last day at work was on the morning of May 15,\" said MBS. It was also working with MOH to trace guests who may have interacted with the employees. On Sunday, 38 new community infections were announced by the ministry, with 21 cases linked to previous patients. Nine more people, including four primary school pupils, who tested positive for Covid-19 have been linked to the Learning Point tuition centre cluster. They comprise pupils from Kong Hwa School, Yu Neng Primary School and St Margaret\\'s Primary School. This took the total number of cases in the cluster to 18, after a 50-year-old woman who works as a tutor there was confirmed to have Covid-19 on May 12. Two new clusters were also reported by MOH on Sunday. The first is linked to a chef in Changi Prison Complex who tested positive for the virus on May 13.There are four cases in this cluster, two of which - a 35-year-old cargo driver at Sats Food Services and a 22-year-old unemployed man - are household contacts of the chef. The second cluster is linked to a cook at Wok Hey (White Sands) who was confirmed to have Covid-19 on May 13. There are three cases in this cluster, including acustomer service officer at Wareesan Management who is a family member and household contact of two previously confirmed cases. Meanwhile, the Changi Airport Terminal 3 cluster had six more cases, including a one-year-old Singaporean boy. He is a family member and household contact of a 44-year-old Singaporean man who works as a private-hire driver at Gojek and had visited the terminal on May 6. The man was confirmed to have Covid-19 on May 12. A 39-year-old male Philippine national who works as a nurse at Ren Ci Nursing Home (Ang Mo Kio) also tested positive and was linked to the cluster. He is a household contact of a 37-year-old male Philippine national who was also among the cases announced on Sunday. The man works as a sales representative at JR Life Sciences and had visited Changi Airport Terminal 3 on May 4. MOH added on Sunday that it was making special swabbing arrangements for all tenants and staff who have been working at White Sands Mall and the Giant outlet at Block 440 Pasir Ris Drive 4 since May 2, as some visitors to these venues tested positive for the virus in the past two weeks. There were also 17 unlinked community cases on Sunday, including a 29-year-old female Philippine national who works as a nurse at Raffles Hospital. Six of the seven cases that tested preliminarily positive for the B1617 variant - which was first detected in India - were unlinked. There were also 11 imported cases announced on Sunday. Globally, the virus outbreak, which began in December 2019, has infected more than 163 million people. Over 3.37 million people have died.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - It\\'s been five long years of waiting for administrative assistant Karen Lim, but she is finally in sight of getting the keys to her build-to-order(BTO) flat in Punggol. She had hoped to move in early this year but construction hold-ups due to the Covid-19 pandemic delayed the schedule by six more frustrating months to this August. Getting her hands on the keys will be a long-held dream come true for 49-year-old Ms Lim, who has lived with her parents all her life. \"When I have my own home, I can have more freedom, although I will make sure to visit them often,\" said Ms Lim, who applied for her two-room flat in Waterfront I @ Northshore under the HDB scheme for singles. \"But the delay makes me sad, especially when I see neighbours from nearby projects sharing photos of them collecting their keys.\" She is crossing her fingers that there will be no further delays even as the Housing Board said the completion dates of some projects may be pushed back even further as a result of the tighter border measures affecting the construction sector. Many BTO projects are expected to be behind schedule by a year or more, up from the original delay timeline of six to nine months announced by the HDB before the latest entry restrictions on South Asian workers took effect. The HDB said last month that about 85 per cent of the 89 ongoing BTO projects were behind schedule, although the agency is taking steps to expedite construction. That means about 43,000 households will get the keys to their flats late. The possibility of a longer waiting time weighs heavily on process technician Nisa Noorkhalam, 31, who recently had a baby boy. Ms Nisa and husband Yunos Jamil, 33, who works as a customer engineer, were looking forward to moving into their four-room BTO flat in Casa Spring @ Yishun early next year. But they will now have to wait until at least the third quarter of next year, with the threat of an even longer waiting time looming over them. \"The waiting time seems to be getting longer and longer. If we could let go of the BTO flat without penalty and get an HDB resale flat, we will definitely consider doing that,\" she said. The couple was unable to extend the rental for their condo unit, so they have moved into the five-room HDB flat of Ms Nisa\\'s parents in Woodlands and will stay there until they get their keys. But there is a positive note, she said, as her parents can now take care of their baby when she returns to work next month. Mr Jerry Loo and wife Corrine Ho, both 30 and working as bank executives, were looking forward to embracing married life in a new home after their January wedding but will now have to wait six more months. Their four-room Bidadari BTO flat in the Woodleigh Hillside project will be ready only around the third quarter of next year, forcing the couple to stay separately with their families. Mr Loo said renting is not an option as the money could be put to better use in the future, adding: \"The small excitements of getting our own flat, renovating it and enjoying the newlywed life and planning for kids are now pushed back, so that\\'s the disappointing part.\" Join ST\\'s Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.

       " {'text': 'vaccination centres step up safety measures as community cases rise Read 3 articles daily and stand to win ST rewards, including the ST News Tablet worth $398. Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - When Ms Hu Lu Yue, 60, visited the vaccination centre at Toa Payoh West Community Club on Thursday (May 20), she noticed that a few new measures had been introduced since her previous visit last month, when she was there for her jab. Ms Hu, a piano teacher, was accompanying her mother for her first jab. She said that during registration, staff at the vaccination centre asked them if they had visited Changi Airport recently. Ms Hu was asked to wait outside the centre while her mother was in the observation area after getting her first shot. She said: \"I am okay with these changes because the staff know that I am outside, so they can just call me if anything happens.\" Fullerton Health, a healthcare provider that runs vaccination centres, said that it is reminding its staff at the centres of its protocols and is monitoring their health more closely. Added precautions are also being taken at three other vaccination centres that The Straits Times (ST) visited. This follows Singapore entering a month of heightened alert on May 16 to stem the spread of Covid-19 cases in the community. For instance, at the Kebun Baru Community Club on Thursday, Raffles Medical staff running the vaccination centre wore face shields over their surgical masks. Mr Sam Weng Kin, 52, who was there for his second dose of the vaccine, said this was a good move. Staff were not wearing face shields when he went for his first jab on April 15, he said. Mr Sam, who is a food and beverage manager, said: \"Last month, people had to queue outside to enter, but now, there is a waiting area where they can sit.\" ST understands that the waiting area is for those who turn up for their appointments at the vaccination centre early, and also for people to wait during the 30-minute observation period after their jabs, so that it does not get too crowded inside. \"We are also progressively rolling out table shields at the respective registration and discharge stations at the vaccination centres,\" said Raffles Medical Group. Meanwhile, at Yew Tee Community Club, Healthway Medical staff were giving out free masks to those who were there to receive the vaccine. Healthway Medical Group said that it verifies whether the people visiting the vaccination centre were at Changi Airport on or after May 1. The Covid-19 cluster linked to Changi Airport Terminal 3 had grown to 95 cases as at Wednesday (May 19). Those who have visited the airport will be held in an isolated waiting area in the clinic away from others, and the doctor will see them as soon as possible, said Healthway. Masks were also being given out at Senja-Cashew Community Club, where Thomson Medical operates a vaccination centre. Mr Simon Tan, 51, who accompanied his wife there for her first jab on Thursday, said she was given a box of disposable masks. He had received his jab at the same centre last week and did not receive any masks then, he said. A spokesman said that Thomson Medical has increased the frequency of disinfection of the cubicles in which the vaccinations take place from a few hours to after every jab. \"I think they are being very careful about the Covid-19 situation because of the new variant,\" said Mr Tan, who runs an import-export business. \"With these unlinked cases, they definitely can\\'t take any chances.\" Join ST\\'s Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - Counselling is being provided to migrant workers who are concerned and worried about the well-being of their loved ones in their home countries, said Manpower Minister Tan See Leng on Sunday (May 23) during a virtual May Day celebration for workers. Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) such as HealthServe and the Migrant Workers\\' Centre are attending to the counselling needs of workers, many of whom come from India and Bangladesh, he said. Other NGOs, such as My Brother SG, have also been working with the Ministry of Manpower\\'s (MOM) Assurance, Care and Engagement (ACE) Group to produce and distribute booklets on mental health to migrant workers across dormitories, said Dr Tan. \"We are grateful for the show of support from all our community partners, who often go the extra mile for our migrant workers,\" he said in a pre-recorded video message in the event, which was organised by the National Trades Union Congress. He added that with the recent increase in Covid-19 cases in the community, there was a need to remain vigilant to protect migrant workers. Aside from going to work, they are still mostly not allowed to leave their places of residence. Non-essential activities outside of the dormitories will be \"limited\", said Dr Tan. \"To aid our migrant workers in fulfilling essential needs, we will work with employers and dormitory operators to facilitate access to supplies, remittanceand telco services,\" he added. To keep workers engaged, the ACE Group is working with community partners to organise virtual activities such as online contests and courses. \"Our MOM officers are also on the lookout for distressed migrant workers who may require assistance,\" said Dr Tan. During the live stream, workers tuned in from their dormitories to watch song-and-dance performances by artists from China, Myanmar and fellow migrant workers in Singapore. About 20,000 care packs with items such as face masks, towels, hand sanitisers, vitamin D tablets and other toiletries will be distributed to workers at a later date than planned because of the current Covid-19 measures. The items, sponsored by DSM, Lazada, Procter & Gamble, Singtel, TS Group andZero1, will be distributed by logistics and transport partner Shalom Movers. The labour movement also penned messages of encouragement to migrant workers on a virtual mosaic wall. Members of the public who wish to show their appreciation to migrant workers can also share their good wishes here.

       " {'text': 'post vaccine infections and reinfections could happen say experts Read 3 articles daily and stand to win ST rewards, including the ST News Tablet worth $398. Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - The past week has delivered a Covid-19 shocker to Singapore, not just because of the increase in community cases - there were 10 - but also the infections in people who had been vaccinated or who had been previously infected. The Ministry of Health (MOH) said last Thursday (April 22) that 17 workers residing in Westlite Woodlands dormitory who had recovered from Covid-19 infections were found to be infected again. Others are now being tested. The following day, the MOH announced that an Indonesian seaman who had received his first vaccine dose tested positive. Last Saturday, two more seamen who had received their first dose of vaccine were also found to be infected. Since they had not received both vaccine jabs, their getting infected is not of great worry since they had not achieved maximum vaccine protection. Of greater concern, however, is another man who had received both vaccine doses by March 19 and who became infected. His parents had flown in from India on April 15. His father was diagnosed with Covid-19 on arrival and sent to hospital, while his mother was placed under quarantine. He received permission to care for her, and he was diagnosed with the disease last Saturday. Experts that The Straits Times spoke to said such post-vaccine infections, as well as reinfections for those who had been previously diagnosed with the disease, are to be expected, even after the majority of the people here have been fully vaccinated. It is a reflection of things to come for the nation at large. Associate Professor Hsu Li Yang, an infectious diseases expert at the National University of Singapore\\'s (NUS) Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, said these cases are \"disappointing, but not a real shock\". He said: \"We expect an average of five out of 100 Pfizer- or Moderna-vaccinated persons to come down with symptomatic Covid-19 if exposed, and 10 per 100 vaccinated persons to come down with any Covid-19 infection (asymptomatic or symptomatic) based on the clinical trials and real-world data from Israel and the United States.\" In a sense, it is like measles, he said. Although 95 per cent of children here are vaccinated against it, cases still pop up. Professor Ooi Eng Eong of Duke-NUS Medical School\\'s emerging infectious diseases programme said: \"These trends are consistent with what we know about vaccines and vaccination.\" He said that most vaccines cannot \"elicit immune response to levels sufficient to prevent infection\". But those who have received Covid-19 vaccines \"around the world have also shown greatly reduced risk of hospitalisation and death\". They are also less likely to spread the infection to others. Prof Hsu explained that as these people are less sick, or totally without symptoms, they have lower viral loads, thus reducing the risk of transmission. He added that newer variants may also have increased infection rates in people who had previously been infected or who had received both vaccine doses. Viral mutations may also increase infections, Prof Hsu said. In Singapore, the most commonly isolated variant in the past month is the B1617 \"Indian\" variant. As to why so many in the dormitory have been reinfected, Professor Teo Yik Ying, dean of the NUS Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, postulated: \"We have known that their living environment continues to be one of the higher-risk environments. \"That means the foreign workers living in the dormitories are always at a higher risk of being infected by someone sharing the same room or communal facilities. \"Also, many of the foreign workers previously infected exhibited no or mild symptoms, and that means their immune response after infection may not have been as strong, which may make them more susceptible to reinfections.\" Prof Ooi said people who are found to be infected but asymptomatic do not pose a problem, as they present no burden on the healthcare system. It may in fact be a good thing for people who have been vaccinated to get asymptomatic infection, he suggested. \"It would naturally boost the immune response without any problems to the person. The vaccine triggers immune response against only the spike protein, but not the other components of the virus. \"Asymptomatic infection could thus provide an even broader repertoire of immune response against Sars-CoV-2,\" he said. Dr Asok Kurup, who chairs the Academy of Medicine\\'s Chapter of Infectious Disease Physicians, questioned the efficacy of some vaccines given globally. He said he has seen a few patients from India - the imported cases - who had received both doses of other types of Covid-19 vaccines \"and yet developed full-blown disease with no antibody response\". He added that the mRNA vaccines - like the Pfizer and Moderna ones used here - do protect against severe illness, and breakthrough infections are few and mild, or asymptomatic. Prof Ooi said with great emphasis: \"The evidence that vaccines work is now more and more abundant, even incontrovertible. \"Places with high vaccination rates, such as Israel, the United Kingdom and California, have all experienced sharp declines in Covid-19 cases. This is despite raging epidemics in these places at the start of the vaccination campaigns.\" But Professor Dale Fisher, an infectious diseases expert at the National University Hospital, cautioned: \"A vaccine was never going to deliver a fairy-tale ending to this pandemic, and actually the exit strategy now is quite complex and varies by country.\" He said Singapore \"is particularly well poised\" to gradually relax its Covid-19 measures as, unlike some countries, it has not made \"confusing recurrent changes in social restrictions\". <!--//--><![CDATA[// ><!--iFrameResize()//--><!]]> <!--//--><![CDATA[// ><!--iFrameResize()//--><!]]> <!--//--><![CDATA[// ><!--iFrameResize()//--><!]]> Prof Fisher added: \"With our strong and consistent policy on mask wearing, mass gatherings, case isolation and quarantine of contacts with support for contact tracing by electronic means, Singapore can progress without the back-and-forth confusion seen elsewhere.\" But even with a high take-up of vaccines, further easing of restrictions will not come soon, he said. Dr Kurup said going forward, Singapore needs to \"manage our weak links, such as dormitories and nursing homes\". Prof Teo warned that from time to time, infections among people who have been vaccinated will emerge, \"especially if they are moving about in high-risk environments where they are constantly being exposed to the coronavirus\". Peeking into the crystal ball, he predicted: \"Unless we can assess an individual\\'s immunity to infection, the likelihood that we will have to remain masked up for a long time more is a very real one.\" Agreeing, Prof Hsu said vaccines will not return us to a pre-Covid-19 era in the next couple of years, where people went mask-free and had the freedom to travel and congregate. But there is some upside, he said. \"Going around masked in public and observing safe distancing has resulted in dramatic drops in the rates of other infectious diseases such as hand, foot and mouth disease and influenza.\" Singapore has not had a single laboratory-confirmed influenza case since May last year.

       " {'text': 'what lies beneath the unhappiness over covid resurgence in spore Read 3 articles daily and stand to win ST rewards, including the ST News Tablet worth $398. Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. There is a word from the ancient Greeks that might explain why some, perhaps many, Singaporeans have turned from being very appreciative of the Government\\'s valiant effort in containing the pandemic last year to feeling let down by its failure to prevent the entry of the B1617 variant from India. It is thumos. Sometimes spelt as thymos, the term does not lend itself to easy translation. Scholars writing in English have translated it - poorly, some say - as \"spirit\" or \"spiritedness\" which together with \"reason\" and \"emotion\" form the three parts of a person\\'s soul, according to Greek mythology. Western political philosophers and commentators have since used it to describe the inner force that moves a person to speak out or act in resentment against those who brush him and his views aside because they consider him as uninformed or incapable of understanding the truths they know. Indeed thumos is one of the reasons which American commentator Francis Fukuyama offered for the rise of the kind of identity politics and new nationalism that propelled Mr Donald Trump to the White House and the United Kingdom out of the European Union. In a long essay in the September/October 2018 issue of Foreign Affairs, he pointed to the example of middle class Americans who feared job losses and displacement as a result of globalisation and free trade and who felt their misgivings had been cast aside by the elite as economic illiteracy. So, as payback, they gave these smarty-pants... Donald Trump. So is thumos at work here triggered by the sudden surge in community infections? Anecdotal evidence and open expressions of disaffection in the social media space would suggest that there is certainly unhappiness that early calls for a pause to arrivals from high-risk countries had gone unheeded. It is this, coupled with the suspicion that complacency had set in, that upset the complainants. And it is exacerbated by the perception that their honest misgivings have either been met with silence or deflected by officials who believe they have thought through everything and that the disgruntled Singaporeans just do not get the big picture. What fuelled this perception is the regular official reminder that Singapore needs migrant workers and that there will be a grave economic cost if the country shuts its borders. This has not gone down well because Singaporeans, by and large, do understand that foreign workers are needed in construction, nursing and other sectors which the local workforce shuns. And they are not clamouring for a complete shutdown of the borders. The exasperation is over the letting in of dependants of other employment pass holders, whether a computer programmer or a logistics manager. Further, talk of a heavy economic cost to the country cannot but strike a discordant note with those who are already suffering a loss of earnings as a result of the tightened restrictions. More likely than not, this dissonance between complaint and response buttresses the feeling that the powers that be have chosen to obfuscate, temporise or not address what they consider as uninformed outbursts. And so thumos kicks in. Only those with the resources to do a detailed study would be able to find out just how prevalent the disaffection is but even in the absence of that, it would be a mistake to dismiss the dissatisfaction uttered thus far as just \"noise\" in the ether or the opportunistic cavilling of those who have an axe to grind. It would also be wrong to call it xenophobic or racist. Singaporeans who complain about letting in dependants do understand that it is only human for work pass holders or permanent residents here to want to get their loved ones out of their home countries as these are being devastated by the pandemic. But Singaporeans want their Government to put their safety first. Did not Cicero the Roman statesman and philosopher lay down this first principle of governance, the welfare of the people is the supreme law (salus populi suprema lex)? It needs to be pointed out that thumos is not all negative though in its earliest manifestation, it drove Achilles into a murderous rage, or so the Homeric epic poem Iliad has it. Thinkers like Plato have written that when exercised within reason, the other part of the soul, it would be a force for the good. It would move individuals to stand up against injustice or wrongdoings, and seek truth, virtue and wisdom. As he wrote in The Republic, within the ideal city state, every citizen would possess a healthy thumos within his soul, allowing him to play his rightful role in civic life. If it is indeed thumos that has moved Singaporeans to, figuratively, raise their eyebrows if not their voices over the entry and spread of the B1617 variant, it is, in all likelihood, a plaintive cry for meaningful engagement on the part of the authorities, beginning perhaps with an honest acknowledgement that the issue could have been handled better. All said, better a Singapore in which citizens have thumos in their soul, as Plato prescribed, than a nation of sullen sheep.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - New measures were announced on Friday (May 14) by the multi-ministry task force on Covid-19, in the light of increased community cases. They will take effect from this Sunday for a month to June 13. A review will be taken after two weeks to see if the measures need to be adjusted further. The new measures are: The current permissible group size will be cut from the current five people to two. The cap of five distinct visitors per household per day will also be reduced to two distinct visitors per household per day. In a statement, the task force said that individuals should continue to limit their overall number of social gatherings to not more than two per day, whether to another household, or meeting friends and family members in a public place. But grandchildren being cared for by their grandparents on a daily basis would not be counted towards the cap of two distinct visitors per household, or to the number of social gatherings per day. However, the task force strongly encouraged grandparents to be vaccinated against Covid-19to protect both themselves and their grandchildren from infection. To reduce the risk of transmission, grandparents should also minimise intermingling between grandchildren from different households. There will be some flexibility for family members who may need to move in bigger groups - especially those with young children or elderly parents - to go for medical appointments, attend classes or go to work in the same vehicle, for instance. People from different households who use public amenities like playgrounds and fitness corners should keep to groups of two and maintain safe distancing. READ FULL STORY: Social gatherings capped at 2 people from May 16 Safe management measures are tightened for higher-risk settings, such as when there is a high density of people who are without masks for a prolonged period. All dining in will cease, including athawker centres and foodcourts, indoors and outdoors. Wedding banquets will have to cease. However, a special arrangement can be made for those with wedding plans this Sunday. They can proceed, but with required pre-event testing for all guests. Food and beverage establishments will allow only takeaway or delivery. Other activities that will also not be allowed include strenuous indoor exercise classes or strenuous individual and group indoor sports and exercise activities. Personalised services which require masks to be removed such as facials and saunas, singing, and the playing of instruments that require intentional expulsion of air like for wind or brass instruments will also not be allowed. But medical and dental services can continue. READ FULL STORY: No dining in at F&B outlets, hawker centres Employers must ensure that employees who are able to work from home do so, the task force said. Those who need employees to return to the workplaces should have staggered start times and flexible working hours for staff. Social gatherings at the workplaces will not be allowed. Meal breaks can be taken at the workplaces, but staff should refrain from intermingling with their colleagues when their masks are taken off. READ FULL STORY: Work from home to be default, workplace social gatherings banned Worship: Only 50 people are allowed at events without pre-event testing, and 100 with pre-event testing. This will apply to congregational and worship services. Live singing will be suspended during this time. Malls: The occupancy limits for shopping malls and showrooms will be further reduced from the current limit of 10 sq m per person of gross floor area, to 16 sq m per person. Odd and even date entry restrictions on Sundayfor popular malls will continue. Places of attraction: The operating capacity of attractions with approval will be cut to 25 per cent from the current 50 per cent. Indoor and outdoor shows can proceed with up to 100 people with pre-event testing, and 50 people without testing. Museums and public libraries can operate with a reduced capacity of 25 per cent. Up to 100 people may be allowed into cinema halls with pre-event testing, but only 50 are allowed without testing. The same rule applies for meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions. Weddings: Wedding receptions will not be allowed. Marriage solemnisations may continue for up to 100 participants with pre-event testing, and 50 participants without testing. Funerals: The cap for attendees is applicable to all days of the funeral, including the burial and cremation, at 20 peopleor fewer, down from 30 peoplecurrently.

This will be done together with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. The time from swab registration to notification of results is typically around 30 minutes for ART, but can take up to 48 hours for PCR tests. Both tests will be funded by the Government for all individuals with those symptoms. This enhanced testing regime will be rolled out progressively, starting with around 200 Sash PHPCs that are already licensed as ART providers from May 15, and will be expanded to include all Sash PHPCs through May alongside polyclinics, emergency departmentsand RSCs.

       " {'text': 'askst why is my arm sore after getting the covid 19 vaccine Read 3 articles daily and stand to win ST rewards, including the ST News Tablet worth $398. Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - The most common side effect experienced among those who have received a Covid-19 vaccine has been soreness around the injection site. This was also more frequent among younger vaccine recipients, with 83 per cent of those between 18 and 55 reporting sore arms after receiving the first jab, noted a Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine clinical trial. This compared with 71 per cent of those aged above 55. Similarly, 87 per cent of people under the age of 65 reported localised pain after the first shot of the Moderna vaccine during clinical trials, compared with 74 per cent of those over 65. The Straits Times looks at why the side effects vary between different groups of people. A: Professor Ooi Eng Eong from the Duke-NUS Medical School said the commonly reported side effects of the mRNA Covid-19 vaccines are largely caused by the body\\'s immune response. These are pain at the injection site, tiredness, headache and body aches. \"For instance, the pain at the injection site is caused not only by the insertion of a hypodermic needle, but also by immune cells infiltrating the injection site to \\'pick up\\' the vaccine,\" he said. \"Moreover, activated immune cells would \\'talk\\' to other immune cells to coordinate their response through chemicals, which causes the... side effects.\" This explains why more people experience side effects after the second dose than the first, as the first jab primes the immune system to the Sars-CoV-2 spike protein. So the immune response to the second dose is likely to be more robust than the first, said Prof Ooi. Dr Tseng Hsien Cho, physician lead at Raffles Medical Group, said the immune system has two layers of response - the innate immune response followed by the adaptive immune response. \"The innate immune response is activated as soon as our body detects any foreign material, from a speck of dust to a virus. The goal is to identify and eliminate the foreign substance with specialised white blood cells known as neutrophils and macrophages,\" he added. This form of inflammatory response explains the aches and pains after receiving the first jab, said Dr Tseng, and this usually lasts for only a few hours or days. It is the adaptive immune response - the second layer of immune defence - that takes days or weeks to develop. \"This is when the immune system\\'s T-cells and B-cells learn to recognise specific invaders, such as proteins from the Sars-CoV-2 virus.\" This time, the immune memory generated is a long-lasting one, such that if the body encounters the same viral protein in future, the immune cells will be able to recognise the invaders and start generating antibodies for defence. A: Prof Ooi said the robustness of the body\\'s immune response to the vaccine can explain why the incidence of side effects differs depending on age. Health Sciences Authority data has shown that about 0.13 per cent of the doses administered resulted in suspected adverse reactions, with younger people more likely to experience side effects. \"Like the rest of our body, the immune system ages. Younger individuals react more robustly to vaccines than older individuals,\" said Prof Ooi. However, he noted that it is unclear whether the side effects are caused by the immune response to the spike gene or protein encoded in the vaccine, or due to other components in the vaccine formulation. Professor Paul Tambyah, president of the Asia-Pacific Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infection, said that while it is possible for the side effects to be \"immune-mediated reactions\", there is no data on exactly how this occurs. For instance, one of the common side effects - facial swelling - is related to the release of a protein by various kinds of cells and can be in response to an allergen or some types of medications, he added. A: Dr Tseng said there has been a higher incidence of allergies linked to mRNA vaccines than non-mRNA vaccines. This is because the mRNA component in the vaccine is wrapped in a bubble of lipids with polyethylene glycol, which is a compound that could trigger allergic responses, he said. However, Prof Tambyah said there is a need to carefully scrutinise the data from various health authorities to determine the range of side effects for different vaccines. For instance, he pointed out that in the clinical trials of the mRNA vaccines, Bell\\'s Palsy, which causes temporary weakness or paralysis of facial muscles, occurred more commonly in subjects who received the vaccine versus those who received a placebo.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - Singapore is tightening rules on social interactions in a bid to tackle the growing number of Covid-19 cases in the community. This means stricter limits on the number of people who can be present in malls, attractions and large standalone stores, with residents urged to have no more than two social gatherings a day. From 11.59pm on Saturday (May 1), the country will also bar all long-term pass holders and short-term visitors who have been in Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka in the last two weeks. The number of new community cases has increased to 35 cases in the past week, from 10 cases in the week before, with the first Covid-19 hospital cluster growing to 13 cases. On Friday (April 30), Education Minister Lawrence Wong, who co-chairs the multi-ministry task force tackling the pandemic, reiterated that Singapore\\'s economic reopening would not be a smooth process. \"From the very start, we have emphasised that this will not be a one-way street, there will be stops and starts and there would be bumps along the way,\" he said at a press conference. \"We are now encountering one such bump in our journey of reopening. But let us also take confidence in the fact that today, we have better capabilities and tools to control the infection.\" The minister acknowledged that these restrictions would create inconveniences but urged Singaporeans to cooperate and scale back their social activities. Doing so is the only way Singapore can slow the virus\\' spread, he said, warning that more stringent measures may have to be considered should the situation worsen. Under new rules that take effect from May 1 to May 14, occupancy limits for malls and large standalone stores will be reduced to one person per 10 sq m of gross floor area, down from one person per 8 sq m. Odd and even entry date restrictions will be reinstated on Sundays at Lucky Plaza and Peninsula Plaza, while outdoor barbecue pits and campsites will be closed. These include pits in parks, HDB estates, condominiums and country clubs. All attractions that received prior approval to operate at 65 per cent of their operating capacity will have to reduce this to 50 per cent from May 7 to 14. Mr Wong added that the restriction on eight unique visitors a day per household remains. Employers should allow staff to work from home as far as possible, he said, noting that the public sector - in particular agencies in the Novena area near Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) - will take the lead in this regard. The hospital hasplaced four wards under lockdownafter it detected a cluster of 13 cases, involving both staff and patients. This means patients will leave the wards only for essential tests, with \"full precautions\" taken when they are moved. No new patients will be admitted into the affected wards, which will be managed by a dedicated group of staff, said TTSH chief executive Eugene Soh. A total of 61 patients - including those infected - have been transferred to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases. Other patients in the affected wards have tested negative for Covid-19 so far. The TTSH cluster consists of eight patients and five staff members - two doctors, a nurse, a healthcare assistant and a cleaner. Four staff members and one patient had been fully vaccinated against the virus, while another patient had received one dose. \"We always knew that vaccinations are not 100 per cent,\" Mr Wong said, warning that Singaporeans should not jump to the conclusion that there is therefore no need for vaccination. \"They protect (you)... from the risk of severe disease, and they do help to reduce transmission. It\\'s not 100 per cent, but there is an impact. And the more of us who are vaccinated, the bigger the impact would be in reducing overall transmission of the virus in our community.\" <!--//--><![CDATA[// ><!--iFrameResize()//--><!]]> Join ST\\'s Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.

But frankly, while such measures indicate how seriously the Government is taking the surge in cases here - there are now nine different clusters - they will not work without the full cooperation of the population. It is the people of Singapore whose actions will decide if the country will face a continued surge in cases, or whether these can be rapidly contained. There are probably several reasons for the recent surge in locally transmitted cases here. One is that more infectious variants have been found here, including all three variants of concern from Britain, Brazil and South Africa, as well as the two variants of interest underlying the massive explosion of cases in India. This makes the surge in cases more difficult to prevent. In the case of the large Tan Tock Seng Hospital cluster, the fault may even lie \"with the airflow and ventilation in the ward\", postulated the Health Ministry\\'s director of medical services Kenneth Mak. Nevertheless, complacency among the population here is also likely to have contributed to the local transmissions. Singapore\\'s success in controlling the outbreak over the past year has probably played a part, as has Covid-19 fatigue. This is very human, very understandable, but very dangerous. Mask wearing is compulsory, but it is not uncommon to see people with their masks pulled below their noses; or even not being masked at all so long as they have a drink in hand. In other words, they have been following the letter of the law, but not the spirit behind it. Similarly, train commuters are repeatedly reminded not to talk - but there is hardly a compartment where one does not find at least one passenger on the phone, or a group animatedly chatting. A country can put the most stringent rules in place, but without the willing cooperation of its citizens, it will find it hard to ward off a second wave of infections. It is not enforcement that will determine whether the measures just introduced succeed or fail, but the behaviour of the people. In order to control community spread, Singapore needs the full cooperation of the community. Some of the recent cases had symptoms but did not see a doctor till their illness became more severe. They were probably worried that they would have to stay isolated while awaiting results. But by not getting checked for Covid-19 and going about life as normal, they raised the risk of transmitting the virus to others. People need to remember that the ones most likely to pick up the disease from them would be the people they are closest to - family, friends and co-workers. A country can put the most stringent rules in place, but without the willing cooperation of its citizens, it will find it hard to ward off a second wave of infections. It is not enforcement that will determine whether the measures just introduced succeed or fail, but the behaviour of the people. If Singaporeans act responsibly, they would again be able to enjoy a relatively normal lifestyle, where friends can meet, games can be played, live entertainment can resume - though with safety measures still in place. If they don\\'t, they only have to look at countries which thought they had defeated the virus - only to pay a terrible price.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - Several children who have been infected with Covid-19 have mild symptoms but none of them are seriously ill, said Education Minister Chan Chun Sing on Sunday (May 16). Still, the situation is worrying because new strains of the coronavirus are much more virulent and seem to attack younger children, he added. \"This is an area of concern for all of us... The sharp rise in the number of community cases today requires us to significantly reduce our movements and interactions in the coming days. We are watching this very closely because we do not think it is a random thing that just happened in one day or so,\" he said at a press conference by the multi-ministry taskforce (MTF) on Covid-19. Associate Professor Kenneth Mak, the Health Ministry\\'s director of medical services, was not present at Sunday\\'s press conference. However, Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said he had spoken to Prof Mak before the briefing, and added: \"He did mention it would appear the B1617 strain appears to affect children more, so you\\'ll notice that for schools, the response has been different compared with last year.\" He said that the Ministry of Education (MOE) has acted quickly to get schools with pupils who had tested positive for Covid-19 to shift to home-based learning, and to test the entire school for the virus. \"That is also a precaution that has been put in recently, in view of (the) different behaviour of this strain of virus.\" Several pupils have been testing positive for the coronavirus in recent days, with many linked to the cluster at the Learning Point tuition centre in Parkway Centre. Five of them - two from Kong Hwa School, one from St Andrew\\'s Junior School and two from St Stephen\\'s School - had tested positive on May 13 after attending classes run by an infected private tutor at the centre. Two pupils from St Andrew\\'s, who took the same school bus as one of the five, tested positive on Saturday (May 15). Another four pupils from the same centre - two from Kong Hwa, one from St Margaret\\'s Primary and one from Yu Neng Primary - also tested positive on Saturday (May 15). Another group of three pupils linked to the EduFirst Learning Centre in Hougang - two from Yio Chu Kang Primary and one from Palm View Primary - tested positive in recent days. A Yio Chu Kang Primary pupil who attended the centre had tested positive on May 13, and other pupils from the centre were quarantined and tested. Two of them later tested positive. Mr Chan said: \"To our knowledge, all the students who are either under quarantine or who have been confirmed to have contracted the virus, a few of them have mild symptoms but no one is seriously ill at this point in time. \"As to how this virus may affect the children differently from the other strains, I think that is best answered by the medical fraternity and we are certainly keeping a close watch on this.\" The MOE announced on Saturday that these seven primary schools with pupils who tested positive for Covid-19 will shift to home-based learning from Monday (May 17). On Sunday evening, MOE announced that students from all primary and secondary schools, junior colleges and Millennia Institute, as well as those from special education schools, will switch to home-based learning (HBL) from Wednesday. However, schools will remain open to continue providing support to children and families who need it. Mr Chan said that besides schools, there is also a risk of transmission in activities outside the classroom, so Singaporeans cannot afford to be complacent. \"As the nature of the virus continues to evolve, we must never make the wrong assumption that the characteristics remain unchanged for the different strains of the virus.\" Join ST\\'s Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.

       " {'text': 'more channelling more cash into cpf amid covid 19 uncertainties Read 3 articles daily and stand to win ST rewards, including the ST News Tablet worth $398. Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - More people sought to tap the benefits of the Central Provident Fund (CPF) last year to stretch their savings amid the pandemic\\'s uncertainties. The number of members who topped up their own or their loved ones\\' CPF retirement savings was nearly 40 per cent higher last year, compared with 2019. At the same time, people who made voluntary housing refunds nearly tripled over the same period, according to the latest CPF Board figures. Also slightly up is the proportion of members who died last year and had specified a recipient for their CPF savings. It is no surprise that more people are channelling more cash into CPF accounts, observers told The Straits Times, since they are now realising the benefits of using the scheme to save. Last year, some 141,130 CPF members made top-ups under the Retirement Sum Topping-Up Scheme, contributing a total of $2.97 billion. In 2019, only 103,800 members grew their CPF funds under the scheme. Total top-ups in 2019 were also lower at $2.14 billion. Meanwhile, about 14,980 members made voluntary housing refunds last year, putting in a total of $1.48 billion. This involves members who had used CPF savings to pay for their property choosing to make a refund of the amount withdrawn. In comparison, only 5,500 members did this in 2019, with a total of $513 million being refunded. OCBC Bank\\'s head of wealth advisory Kelvin Goh said CPF funds offer members more attractive risk-adjusted returns, compared with regular savings accounts and even some investments. The higher take-up rate is likely boosted by the lower interest rate environment and market volatility brought about by the pandemic, said DBS Bank\\'s head of financial planning literacy Lorna Tan, noting that the trend of CPF top-ups is expected to continue. The Retirement Sum Topping-Up Scheme allows members to use cash or CPF savings to top up their own or their loved ones\\' accounts. For recipients under 55, the Special Account can be topped up to the current Full Retirement Sum, which is $186,000 this year. Those aged 55 and older can have their Retirement Accounts topped up to the current Enhanced Retirement Sum, which is $279,000 this year. Mr Wilson Loy, Standard Chartered Bank Singapore\\'s head of investment advisory and strategy, said another factor for the increase could be the tax reliefs granted for topping up CPF accounts. <!--//--><![CDATA[// ><!--iFrameResize()//--><!]]> <!--//--><![CDATA[// ><!--iFrameResize()//--><!]]> CPF members can get tax reliefs of up to $7,000 per calendar year for top-ups made to their own accounts, and up to another $7,000 for top-ups made for their parents, parents-in-law, grandparents, grandparents-in-law, spouse and siblings. Ms Jacquelyn Tan, UOB\\'s head of group personal financial services, said the bank saw more customers tapping programmes like the CPF Investment Scheme and Supplementary Retirement Scheme last year. These allow them to use their savings for investments that generally carry lower risk. Some people who made top-ups last year said they were attracted to the higher risk-free returns that CPF funds offer. Mr Joel Siew, who topped up his own CPF Special Account last year, said the 4 per cent interest rate on funds in it is a draw. Like many working adults, the 32-year-old banker believes that starting his retirement planning early will give him better returns over time. Human resource manager Lydia Ong, 38, who put more money into her CPF Special Account last year, said the pandemic has brought about much uncertainty and volatility in the financial markets. \"In such times, it makes sense to go with something less risky,\" she added.

       " {'text': 'spore hk travel bubble wont start if covid 19 threshold is breached Read 3 articles daily and stand to win ST rewards, including the ST News Tablet worth $398. Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - The Singapore-Hong Kong air travel bubble may not start if the threshold of a seven-day moving average of five or fewer unlinked community cases in either city is breached. Responding to a question about how the recent spike in community cases here may affect the travel bubble, which will allow quarantine-free travel between the two cities from May 26, Education Minister Lawrence Wong said on Friday (April 30) that Singapore will continue to apply the mechanism of the seven-day moving average, as agreed by both parties. \"If it starts, but along the way the threshold is breached, then it may well be suspended,\" said Mr Wong, who is co-chair of the multi-ministry task force tackling Covid-19. Given the fluid Covid-19 situation around the world, Singaporeans have to be mentally prepared that such new initiatives could be disrupted or suspended, he added. \"This is not a situation where new initiatives are rolled out and then they will continue permanently without any potential for disruption,\" said Mr Wong. The May 26 commencement date for the air travel bubble was announced earlier this week by Transport Minister Ong Ye Kung and his Hong Kong counterpart, after being deferred last year following a spike in Covid-19 cases in Hong Kong. The travel bubble will have a cautious start with one flight a day in each direction, capped at 200 passengers on each flight for the first two weeks. This will then be increased to two flights per day from June 10. Passengers from both sides must test negative for Covid-19 before boarding the direct flights, and take a test on arrival as well. Those using Hong Kong passports leaving the territory are also required to be fully vaccinated before travelling. This will not apply to Singapore citizens and others using non-Hong Kong travel documents for departure. As at Friday, the number of unlinked cases in the community had increased from five cases in the week before to six cases in the past week. <!--//--><![CDATA[// ><!--iFrameResize()//--><!]]> Join ST\\'s Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.

       " {'text': 'the best and worst places to be in the world as covid 19 variants outrace vaccinations Read 3 articles daily and stand to win ST rewards, including the ST News Tablet worth $398. Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. HONG KONG (BLOOMBERG) - A combination of nailing the virus and rolling out vaccines at one of the fastest rates in Asia saw Singapore top Bloomberg\\'s Covid Resilience Ranking this month, dethroning New Zealand for the first time in the measure of the best and worst places to be in the pandemic era. The tiny city state had gotlocally transmitted cases down to near zero thanks to border curbs and a strict quarantine programme, allowing citizens to largely go about their everyday lives, even attending concerts and going on cruises. At the same time, Singapore had already administered vaccines that cover the equivalent of a fifth of its population, an aspect of pandemic control that other virus eliminators like New Zealand, Australia and Taiwan are lagging on. But if there\\'s one lesson from April, it\\'s that vaccination alone isn\\'t ending the pandemic. Places like France and Chile, where people have good access to shots, fell in the Ranking as outbreaks swelled - fuelled by mutations of the virus that increasingly have their source in the developing world, where vaccines are in short supply and mitigation efforts are failing. While more than one billion doses have now been administered globally, not enough are going to poorer nations like India, which are driving global infection levels to new records. Nowhere has this played out more worryingly than in Poland and Brazil, which dropped to the bottom two spots among the 53 economies ranked. Mexico, which has been last since the Ranking debuted in November, inched up in April for the first time, to 48th, as its virus testing improved. The United States climbed four rungs this month to 17th, as its fast vaccination programme saw a reduction in deaths, though cases ticked up amid a loosening of precautions. Britain - up seven places to No. 18 as its lockdown lifts- was pairing rapid inoculation with tighter border controls to keep out new variants, the most recent barring travellers from India, where a new \"double mutation\" strain has emerged. The Asian giant, which is now seeing more than 300,000 infections every day in a resurgent outbreak, sank 10 places to 30th in April. The Covid Resilience Ranking uses a wide range of data to capture where the pandemic is being handled most effectively, with the least social and economic disruption - from mortality and testing rates to vaccine access and freedom of movement. It scores economies of more than US$200 billion (S$265 billion) each month on 10 core metrics. The start of vaccinations in a number of places a few months ago meant some governments loosened restrictions too early, presenting an opening for variants to seed widely before high enough levels of immunity had been established. Poland has administered vaccinations enough for 13 per cent of its population, greater penetration than two-thirds of the world. Yet the variant first identified in Britain took over, accounting for 90 per cent of new infections and causing a record spike in cases and fatalities. Meanwhile, the virulent strain first identified in Brazil is ravaging Latin America, even in places like Chile where nearly a third of the population has been fully vaccinated. Though some places like Israel have seen marked reductions in their outbreaks thanks to early and widespread vaccination, experts caution against complacency that could still undo their progress. With over 55 per cent of its population fully vaccinated, Israel rose to 4th in April\\'s Ranking. \"This is not over by any means,\" said Dr Ali Mokdad, chief strategy officer for population health at the University of Washington. \"The longer this drags on, the more likely it is that we will see new variants. Then there is a need for a new vaccine or a booster vaccine, and we start all over again.\" With the variants\\' spread outpacing vaccination in many places, the Asia-Pacific region\\'s success at eliminating and keeping out Covid-19 means its economies continue to dominate the Ranking. The top three - Singapore, New Zealand and Australia - are able to provide a pre-pandemic quality of life for their populations, with the exception of international travel, which is basically shut down to prevent the virus from slipping back in. Vaccine supply in most places around the world is grossly inadequate, with richer nations like the US and Japan snapping up stock of the highly sought-after and effective mRNA shots. Even among the biggest vaccine manufacturers in the world, supplies are tight, with India and China having difficulty producing enough doses for their vast populations. Side effects associated with shots from AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson are adding to hesitation among people in some places to get inoculated. The fate of tenuous steps towards reopening by some countries, and the race between vaccination and virus variants, will be the key focus for the Covid Resilience Ranking into May. <!--//--><![CDATA[// ><!--iFrameResize()//--><!]]> While the failure of powerful, developed economies to curb the spread of the coronavirus has been a stunning development of the pandemic, major Western nations like the US and Britain have since gained back ground in sewing up vaccine supply and rolling out shots. Meanwhile, most developing nations have yet to start inoculations in a significant way, lacking the purchasing power to sign supply deals. Countries with the highest average incomes are getting vaccinated about 25 times faster than those with the lowest. Covax, the World Health Organisation-backed effort to help poorer countries procure doses, started distributing shots onlyat the end of February. Disparities in immunity pose a threat to the world: The more the coronavirus spreads unchecked, the more opportunity there is for dangerous new mutations to develop. Some existing vaccines have already been shown to be less effective against new variants like the one from South Africa, and the chance of a mutation entering a vaccinated country and igniting a new wave cannot be discounted. \"We need countries and companies that control the tools that could save lives to share financial resources, vaccine doses and know-how and to be transparent about their bilateral donations,\" WHO director-general Tedros AdhanomGhebreyesus tweeted in April. The growing crisis in the developing world is putting pressure on advanced economies to do more to help. In India, where devastating scenes of oxygen shortages and overwhelmed crematoriums are unfolding, vaccine makers say that production capacity is limited by the US prioritising raw materials for its own use. Meanwhile, US President Joe Biden\\'s government is also sitting on a stockpile of tens of millions of extra doses after securing enough for the American adult population. The pandemic\\'s hit to emerging economies is likely to be longer and more sustained. Most countries in Latin America won\\'t be able to return to pre-pandemic growth levels until 2023 and per capita income won\\'t recover until 2025, later than anywhere else, according to the International Monetary Fund. The World Bank says the pandemic will push as many as 150 million people into extreme poverty by the end of 2021. It\\'s in vaccination where former laggards like the US and Britain have made up for lost ground, with investment in science and research proving pivotal to their leads when it comes to shots. Operation Warp Speed saw some US$18 billion ploughed into developing the first Covid vaccinesthat have now been administered to cover the equivalent of 35 per cent of the American population. In Israel, where more than half of the country\\'s ninemillion people have been fully vaccinated, life is normalising fast. Live theatre and sporting events are back on, mask wearing is no longer required outdoors, restaurants and bars are packed, and students are attending classes in person. In Britain, some pubs are allowed to open while in the US, domestic travel bookings are surging. Still, in an acknowledgement that these gains are fragile, officials are trying to reopen only cautiously. Israel will allow international tourists starting from May 23, but only in stages, starting with groups for easier monitoring. Britain will allow non-essential travel to a list of \"greenlit\" countries next month, but the government is asking citizens to lower their expectations for summer vacations. Even in the US, which has largely refrained from imposing travel curbs throughout the pandemic, the State Department issued guidance in April advising travellers not to go to over a hundred countries due to the Covid-19 risk. The worldwide vaccination effort has seen some major setbacks, with reports of blood clotting after inoculation associated with the AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines. Although roll-outs have resumed after regulators said the vaccines\\' benefits outweigh the risks, the controversy has discouraged some people from coming forward. In the Asia-Pacific region, a delay in starting inoculation is being compounded by widespread hesitation. After early success containing the virus, people in places like China and Japan appear less enthusiastic about taking shots compared with Western nations, with some not seeing an urgent need. With smaller outbreaks and few fatalities, these economies still have an edge in the Resilience Ranking, but for how long? The underperformance of some of the world\\'s most prominent democracies in containing the coronavirus, contrasted with the success of authoritarian countries like China and Vietnam, has raised questions over whether democratic societies are cut out for tackling pandemics. Bloomberg\\'s Covid Resilience Ranking tells a different story: Democracies have made up the majority of our top 10 since the measure\\'s debut in November. Success in containing Covid-19 with the least disruption appears to rely less on being able to order people into submission and more on governments fostering a high degree of trust and societal compliance. When citizens have faith in the authorities and their guidance, lockdowns may not be needed at all, as Japan and South Korea showed through most of 2020, though fierce winter waves definitely challenged those more open approaches. Now No. 2 after a five-month run at the top, New Zealand emphasised communication from the start, with a four-level alert system that gives people a clear picture of how and why the government acts as the outbreak evolves. Like China, Singapore and Australia, it also shut its borders, which has proven a key metric for containment success. Investment in public health infrastructure also matters. Undervalued in many places before 2020, systems for contact tracing, effective testing and health education bolstered the top performers, helping socialise hand-washing and the wearing of face masks. This has been key to avoiding economically crippling lockdowns, according to Dr Anthony Fauci, the US\\' top infectious diseases official. Singapore - the new No. 1 - mandates masks in public and uses apps to make contact tracing easier. Bloomberg\\'s Covid Resilience Ranking is a snapshot of how the pandemic is playing out in 53 major economies. By zeroing in on the progress of vaccine distribution, it also provides a window into how these economies\\' fortunes may shift in the future. It\\'s not a final verdict - it never could be, given the imperfections in virus and vaccine data and the fast pace of this crisis, which has seen subsequent waves confound places that handled outbreaks well initially. Circumstance and pure luck also play a role, but are hard to quantify. Vaccine roll-out is a decisive factor in 2021, with challenges from logistics and storage to hesitancy about getting inoculated. Still, having endured over a year of fighting Covid-19, governments and populations now have a better understanding of the pathogen andhow best to curb its spread and mitigate the damage it inflicts. As the data shift, the Ranking will change too. Join ST\\'s Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. SPH Digital News / Copyright © 2021 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - A possible Covid-19 cluster has surfaced at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, with a nurse infected and likely infections in a doctor and three patients in a general ward. The Health Ministry said that one of the three new Covid-19 community cases on Wednesday (April 28) was a nurse from Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH). The 46-year-old Filipino womanwas deployed at Ward 9D, a general ward. She developed a cough, sore throat and body aches on Tuesday, and sought medical treatment at TTSH, said MOH. Her test result came back positive for Covid-19 infection on the same day, and she was warded at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID). Her serology test result is pending. She received her first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine on Jan 26and the second dose on Feb 18. The vaccine is effective in preventing symptomatic disease for the vast majority of those vaccinated, but it is possible for vaccinated individuals to get infected, said the ministry in a statement. TTSH has locked down the affected ward, and tested the patients and staff who had been in the ward. The hospital said late Wednesday night that it is also tightening its ward visiting policy till further notice as a necessary precaution to contain the situation and protect its patients and staff. \"We are tightening our ward visiting policy till further notice, allowing only two pre-registered visitors throughout a patient\\'s stay,\" it said in a Facebook post. \"We will monitor the situation and review our policy accordingly. We will also be swabbing all staff in the main hospital’s ward block.\" So far, MOH said it has detected four more cases in TTSH who have tested preliminarily positive for Covid-19 infection. These are a doctor and three patients who were being cared for in the same ward. As a precautionary measure, all staff who treated the infected patients, as well as all visitors, patients and staff working in Ward 9D will be placed under quarantine, it said. Epidemiological investigations and contact tracing are ongoing. As it is conducting further testing for these four cases, they have not been included in Wednesday\\'scase count,MOH explained. The Straits Times understands that one of the patients found to have tested positive for the virus is a 72-year-old woman who had been warded at the hospital since April 20. She had been admitted to Ward 9D- a C class ward - for rheumatoid arthritis and developed a cough and fever on Sunday. She was told by a doctor around noon on Wednesday that she had to go for a Covid-19 test because she had been \\u200bhaving a fever for several days. The results came back positive at about 5pm. Meanwhile, her husband received a call at about 2pm from a nurse saying there was a suspected Covid-19 case in his wife\\'s ward\\u200b, but that it was not his wife. The woman, a housewife, had not yet received the Covid-19 vaccine but was scheduled to get her first shot on Wednesday. Her husband, son, daughter and a seven-year-old grandson who had visited her will be quarantined. Generally, the incubation period for the virus is five to six days, but can be as short as two daysor longer than 14 days. Patients are also believed to be infectious for a couple of days before symptoms appear. The number of new cases in the community has increased to 13 cases in the past week from ninecasesin the week before.The number of unlinked cases in the community has also increased to sixcases in the past week from fivecases in the week before. Among the other two community cases on Wednesday is a 38-year-old Singaporean man who works as an Immigration andCheckpoints Authority (ICA) officer deployed at Changi Airport Terminal 1, but hadnot gone to work after an onset of symptoms. He developed a cough last Fridayand sought medical treatment the next day at aGP clinic, where he was given twodays’ medical leave. On Monday,he developed a fever, loss of sense of smelland body aches, and sought medical treatment atTTSH the next day. He was tested for Covid-19 and his test came back positive on the same day. His previous tests from rostered routine testing– the last wason April 22 – were all negative. His serology test result ispending. The second case isa 58-year-old Singaporean man who works as a constructionproject manager in Nepal, and had been there last year from Feb 13 to Dec 13. When he returned to Singapore, he served his stay-home notice (SHN) at a dedicated facility until Dec 27. His test taken on Dec 23 during SHN was negative and he was asymptomatic, said the ministry. He was detected when he took a Covid-19 pre-departure test on Monday in preparation for his trip back to Nepal. His test resultcame back positive the next day, and he was taken to the NCID. His serology test result is pending, but hisCt value was very high, which is indicative of a low viral load. MOH said he could beshedding minute fragments of the virus RNA from a past infection, which are nolonger transmissible and infective to others. There were 20 imported cases and no dormitory cases on Wednesday. <!--//--><![CDATA[// ><!--iFrameResize()//--><!]]> <!--//--><![CDATA[// ><!--iFrameResize()//--><!]]> <!--//--><![CDATA[// ><!--iFrameResize()//--><!]]> Join ST\\'s Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - The Sars-CoV-2 virus that sparked the Covid-19 pandemic has undergone more than 6,600 unique spike protein mutations, said Dr Sebastian Maurer-Stroh, executive director of the Bioinformatics Institute at the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*Star). Viruses mutate whenever there is a \"mistake\" in the replication process. This could result from an addition, a deletion or a change to its genetic code. If that mistake increases its survival prospects, more copies of that \"wrong\" replication will survive, and sometimes overwhelm the original version. For example, the D614G mutation which started to rise sharply in February last year is now found in all samples of the virus, no matter which variant they are. Because this variant became so pervasive, it was given a clade name - or family group - of its own, and is designated as G clade. The World Health Organisation (WHO) says that while the G clade has increased infectivity and transmission, the illness it causes is not more severe, nor does it affect diagnostics, treatment or vaccines. This G clade and its sub clades - which include GRY, a clade named for the UK variant B117 in July last year - have accounted for practically all Covid-19 infections since the middle of last year, totally displacing the original virus that emerged in Wuhan. So if there are so many mutations of the virus, why does the World Health Organisation list only three of \"concern\" so far, and a handful that are of \"interest\", and practically ignore the rest? To qualify as a variant of concern (VOC), the mutated virus has to show evidence in fulfilling at least one of these criteria: that it transmits more easily, causes more severe illness, significantly reduces neutralisation by antibodies, or reduces the effectiveness of treatment, vaccines or diagnosis. Dr Maurer-Stroh explained that not all mutations make a difference to the disease in these ways. Hence, these mutations do not make waves. Variants usually comprise a set of five to 15 mutations that, together, give them some added advantage. Dr Maurer-Stroh said the terms \"double mutant\" or \"triple mutant\" variants used to describe the virus strains rampaging in India are therefore a misnomer, but broadly refer to the more significant mutations found in those variants. Fortunately, there are only three VOCs right now. However, there are several variants of interest (VOI) which appear to exhibit some of the characteristics of a VOC, but without sufficient evidence for the moment. That may change. They include the two variants first detected in India that are causing the huge surge in cases over the past month. In spite of the spiralling number of cases and deaths in India - 22 million cases and more than 235,000 deaths - the WHO has not classified them as VOCs as there is still uncertainty over how much of the spread of Covid-19 there is caused by the variants and how much is due to other factors such as poor safety measures and insufficient hospital capacity. There have been more than 6,600 unique mutations to the coronavirus\\' spike protein since it emerged in December 2019, said Dr Maurer-Stroh, who is involved in collecting and analysing changes to the viral genome under the Gisaid data-sharing platform, which has enabled global sharing of more than 1.5 million virus sequences. This works out to one unique mutation every two hours, day or night. Are the vaccines available today of any use against these variants? Definitely, said Professor Ooi Eng Eong of the Duke-NUS Medical School, who is himself involved in developing an mRNA vaccine. He said: \"Studies among vaccinated individuals have found that the mRNA vaccines are also capable of preventing infection from the various variants of concern. \"At least four reports have shown that the rate of breakthrough symptomatic variant Sars-CoV-2 infection has been below 1 per cent among vaccinated individuals.\" Antibodies produced by vaccines recognise part of the spikes on the virus. The concern is if the part that the vaccine recognises is changed, would it still be able to protect people who have been vaccinated? Prof Ooi explained that vaccines do not just produce antibodies, but also \"activate a suite of immune responses\" in the body, including the production of T cells that kill both the virus and infected cells. These would not be affected by changes in the spike protein. However, Associate Professor Hsu Liyang, an infectious diseases expert at the National University of Singapore\\'s Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, added a word of caution about assuming that current vaccines will remain as protective. What applies today may not always be the case, he said. \"We don\\'t expect the virus to stay still. There will be more variants thrown up.\" Join ST\\'s Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. SPH Digital News / Copyright © 2021 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd. Co.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - Seven family members of a 38-year-old Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) officer who was earlier diagnosed with Covid-19are confirmed to have the virus, and were likely to have caught it during a gathering last Sunday (April 25). The Health Ministry (MOH) gave this update on Thursday night, adding that all seven had already been placed under quarantine when their diagnosis was confirmed. The eight of them had gathered for a meal, when transmission was likely to have taken place, MOH said. The ICA officer, who works in Changi Airport Terminal 1, had been one of the unlinked cases that the ministry announced on Wednesday. The seven cases in the new family cluster, all of them Singaporean, are: - A 32-year-old nurse who works at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH). She is the wife of the ICA officer, but does not work in wards affected by the TTSH cluster. MOH said its investigations do not show a link between her and the TTSH cluster, but the ongoing testing of all staff in the hospital's wards will serve as an additional check. - A 39-year-old male who works as a private hire driver and a security officer at the Ion Orchard mall. He developed a cough on April 28. - A three-year-old boy, who is the nephew of the ICA officer. He was last at school on April 22, and developed a fever on April 28. - A housewife, 33, who was asymptomatic. - A retiree, 72, who is the father of the ICA officer and lives in the same household. He was asymptomatic. - A 65-year-old man who works as a telephone operator at Goodwood Park Hotel. He was asymptomatic. - A technical officer at SP PowerGrid, 38. He developed a cough and body aches on April 28. The ICA officer had developed a cough last Fridayand sought medical treatment the next day at a general practitioner clinic, where he was given two days' medical leave. On Monday, he developed a fever, anosmia and body aches, and sought medical treatment at TTSH. He was tested for Covid-19, and his test came back positive on the same day. But previous tests from rostered routine testing - the most recent being last Friday- had been negative. Meanwhile, ICA has said that 32 of its officers at Changi Airport have been placed under quarantine order, while around 100 will be tested for Covid-19 as a precaution. The seven family members of the 38-year-old ICA officer were among 16 community cases reported by the MOH on Thursday. This is the highest number of such cases since July 11 last year, when there were 24 community cases. Eight of these 16 cases were linked to the 46-year-old TTSH nurse. These cases were detected through MOH's proactive testing of patients and staff in the affected ward. The sole unlinked case is a fully vaccinated 39-year-old Vietnamese woman, who works as a cleaner at a community care facility at Tuas South. At work, she dons full personal protection equipment, including an N95 mask, face shield, gown and gloves, said MOH. She also periodically helps out at a food stall at The Summit, a canteen at the National University of Singapore's Bukit Timah campus. The vaccine is effective in preventing symptomatic disease for the vast majority of those vaccinated, but it is possible for vaccinated individuals to get infected, MOH said. She was asymptomatic, and was detected when she was tested on Monday as part of rostered routine testing, MOH said. Her pooled test result came back positive for Covid-19 the next day, and she was conveyed in an ambulance to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID). An individual test was done on Tuesday, and her test result came back positive for Covid-19 infection. Her earlier tests from the routine screening - the last being on April 14- were all negative for Covid-19 infection. In all, 35 new coronavirus cases were confirmed as at Thursday noon, taking Singapore's total to 61,121. Other than the 16 community cases, there were 19 imported cases and none in the dormitories. <!--//--><![CDATA[// ><!--iFrameResize()//--><!]]> Join ST's Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.

       " {'text': 'dining in at institutes of higher learning canteens and dining halls Read 3 articles daily and stand to win ST rewards, including the ST News Tablet worth $398. Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - Dining in at universitiesis allowed, providedsafe management measures are in place at canteens and dining halls on campus. However, how this policy is implemented differs across the universities here, students told The Straits Times. Unlike eateries and hawker centres that can offer only takeaway or delivery from now until June 13, canteens and dining halls can continue to serve students and staff. This is because students and staff are on campuses for a longer period of time, said the Ministry of Education (MOE) on its website. Nanyang Technological University (NTU) said that students and employees can eat in the university\\'s canteens and foodcourts, but they must respect the rule on a maximum group size of two. They are also required to sit 1m apart from each other, and intermingling across different tables is not allowed, the university said in an e-mail lastSaturday (May 15). \"Individuals should avoid any social interactions while eating, mask up when not consuming food and beverage, and leave the dining venue immediately after finishing their meals and not linger,\" it added. Both the Singapore Institute of Management (SIM) and the National University of Singapore (NUS) allow students to dine in as well, with some differences to the rules. Checks by The Straits Times show that SIM\\'s foodcourt, Foodfest, allows dine-in customers, while NUS allows dining in at hostel dining halls but not canteens. Meanwhile, NTU allows diners in both its canteens and foodcourts but not fast-food outlets and restaurants on campus. Seating arrangements also differ between universities, with NUS students told that they should sit individually while having their meals in dining halls at hostels. Students such as Ms Yeo Think-E, 19, are adjusting to the new rules but have welcomed the move to allow dine-ins. The first-year NTU student said that the dine-in policy was necessary because of the size of her campus, which means that student accommodation is often located a distance from where their classes take place. \"It takes me 20 minutes to walk between my hostel, Pioneer Hall and my lab. A lot of time is lost in between if I can only eat in my room,\" she said. For Mr Fung Ting Wei, 23, it is too time consuming for him to travel home to have his meals between classes at SIM. \"If we can\\'t eat on campus, it\\'ll be hard to find a place to eat since we don\\'t know whether we can eat in our lecture halls,\" he said. Other students such as Ms Yeoh Joe Ning, 21, will still be taking precautions, even though she is allowed to have her meals in the King Edward VII Hall at NUS where she stays. \"I\\'ll probably still bring food back to my room. The residents of my hall live in different parts of Singapore and you don\\'t know if people have been to places visited by those who have Covid-19,\" she said. Dining halls and canteens in institutes of higher learning are not the only places where people can eat in public during this period. The consumption of food and drinks in public places including parks is not prohibited. However, this should be in instances when it would be inconvenient to return home or to the workplace to eat, said the Ministry of Health. \"In such instances, members of the public should avoid crowded spaces and minimise social interactions, including maintaining safe distancing at all times,\" said the ministry.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - Singapore is not closing its doors to all work pass holders and their dependants, said the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) on Saturday (May 8), following surges in Covid-19 cases in several countries. It is reducing arrivals from higher-risk areas, meaning that some work pass holders who had earlier obtained entry approvals will have to be rescheduled to arrive in later weeks. The ministry issued this clarification following social media posts inaccurately alleging that no work pass holders would be allowed entry from next Tuesday. \"Work pass holders needed for key strategic and infrastructural works will still be allowed to enter Singapore,\" it said in a Facebook post. This includes most foreign domestic workers and workers in the construction, marine shipyard and process sectorswho had earlier obtained approval. Other work pass holders who obtained approval to enter prior to July 5 will not be allowed to enter. On Friday, MOM announced that it would also no longer be accepting new entry applications for work pass holders from higher-risk areas, given the resurgence of the Covid-19 virus in several countries and the new viral variants that have emerged. However, the changes do not apply to people from lower-risk areas who are seeking, or have already been given, entry approval, as well as those under the periodic commuting arrangement, reciprocal green lane and other approved travel lanes. All countries and regions are considered to be at higher risk, except Australia, Brunei, New Zealand, the Chinese mainland, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau. The ministry has started to inform affected work pass holders and their employers of the changes to their entry. Here are some of the recent steps taken to deal with the impact of Covid-19 among foreign workers: April 26 - The Building and Construction Authority announces measures to help the construction sector cope with the manpower crunch, such as the temporary easing of a skills-certification rule for workers from China. - The public sector willgrant construction contracts an additional 49-day extension for delays caused by the pandemic, meaning contractors get a total of five to six months more to complete projects. - The Government will foot 0.1 per cent of the awarded contract sum for every month of delay under cost-sharing measures, to free up cash flow for contractors. This applies to eligible public sector projects with a contract sum of up to $100 million. May 7 - The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) announces that Singapore has stopped accepting new entry applications for work pass holders from countries or regions with a higher-risk of Covid-19. - MOM says it will reschedule entry for those who had earlier obtained approval, with the exception of those from the construction, marine shipyard and process sectors and domestic workers. May 8 - MOM announces higher foreign worker levy rebates, from $90 to $250 per month, between May and December, for firms in the construction, marine and process sectors.

       " {'text': \"hospitals in singapore embark on mass covid 19 swabbing of staff Read 3 articles daily and stand to win ST rewards, including the ST News Tablet worth $398. Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - Many hospitals in Singapore have begun swabbing all staff to detect Covid-19 cases, if any, as early as possible. At the same time, patient-facing staff, particularly those who work in emergency departments and wards, will continue to be tested regularly as part of a nationwide initiative for all hospitals. This follows the emergence of a Covid-19 cluster at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH), which has since grown to be the country's largest active cluster, with 43 cases currently. The cluster has been linked to a new variant of the coronavirus first identified in India, which is now in the grip of a devastating second wave of the disease. TTSH ceased taking in new patients because of the cluster. The mass swabbing drive, in which front-liners such as doctors, nurses and therapists are expected to be tested first, could be completed by the end of the month. OnFriday (May 7), Changi General Hospital (CGH) and Sengkang General Hospital (SKH) started to swab staff. CGH said it began with 700 staff on that day and will continue to swab more this week. Senior management at SKH, which has a staff strength of close to 3,900, were among the first to be tested. All staff, including doctors, nurses, allied health professionals, administrators, will eventually be swabbed as well as those working on the hospital premises such as housekeepers and staff at the eateries there. Singapore General Hospital (SGH), which has followed suit on the testing, said in a Facebook post on Mondaythat it has started a one-off Covid-19 swab testing of staff, as well as on-site vendors, service partners and others who work in the hospital, as part of its proactive staff surveillance. Those in patient-facing roles will also be swabbed regularly, it said in the post. SGH said it is embarking on the exercise because no amount of stringent measures can keep the coronavirus out of the hospitalif silent infections are not rooted out. SKH and SGH come under SingHealth, which is extending the swabbing exercise to all its hospitals and speciality centres such as the National Cancer Centre Singapore, National Heart Centre Singapore andthe Singapore National Eye Centre. The Straits Times understands that patient-facing staff will be tested agaiin in a week’s time and then those who are vaccinated may get their testing frequency reduced to 14 days. Hospitals under the National University Health System are expected to start the swabbing exercise from Tuesday, while those under the National Healthcare Group should be starting soon as well. Private hospitals are also understood to be doing the same. IHH Healthcare Singapore, which has hospitals such as Mount Elizabeth Hospital and Gleneagles Hospital, started the mass swabbing on May 10. Raffles Hospital aims to start swabbing staff some time this week. Join ST's Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.

SINGAPORE - There will be more entry restrictions at pre-schools and early intervention centres from Saturday (May 8), including a ban on all parents except those with newly enrolled children. Mixing of children between different classes will also not be allowed, while field trips and other large group activities conducted outside centres will be suspended. These are part of efforts to tighten Covid-19 measures at centres, in line with the national effort to slow viral transmission, said the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) on Wednesday. However, children under seven will not be required to use the TraceTogether application from May 17 - the date the usage of the contact-tracing system becomes compulsory at venues. The rules will be implemented together with the current set of Covid-19 rules in place at pre-schools, including more cleaning, temperature and health checks up to three times a day, and cohorting in centres. From Saturday to May 30, only people who are needed to support operations within centres, those performing necessary functions such as licensing, and parents accompanying newly enrolled children will be allowed into centres. All other parents will not be allowed in. Pre-schools and early intervention centres are advised to conduct parent-teacher conferences online, and conduct virtual tours for prospective students, said ECDA. Contractors providing supplementary programmes such as enrichment will only be allowed to serve up to four pre-schools during this period, to reduce the risk of transmission between centres. However, an exception will be made for providers of the Development Support-Learning Support programme and Development Support Plus programme. The agency also said that children will only be allowed to participate in activities within their own class and in small groups, as part of measures to tighten the movement of staff and children. The centres will conduct these sessions for groups of five children, down from eight - in line with national guidelines. It added that outdoor activities during this period may continue, in these smaller groups. However, large-scale outdoor activities such as learning journeys and field trips will have to be postponed for now. The agency has advised all centres with existing plans at external venues to push them back. Also, all staff meetings and training must be conducted online when restrictions come into effect on Saturday. Get the ST Smart Parenting newsletter for expert advice. Visit the microsite for more.

SINGAPORE - There were 40 new coronavirus cases confirmed as at Sunday noon (April 25), taking Singapore's total to 61,006. All of the cases were imported and had been placed on stay-home notice upon arrival in Singapore, said the Ministry of Health (MOH). Among them were two Singaporeans, 10 permanent residents and six foreign domestic workers. In an update on Sunday night, MOH said the imported cases included five children aged between four and nine. They comprised three dependant's pass holders who travelled from India and Nepal as well two permanent residents who travelled from India. Of the 40 cases, three were symptomatic. There were no community cases and no cases from migrant workers' dormitories.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - Singapore is experiencing its worst spate of Covid-19 community infections in close to a year, in a painful reminder of how the virus situation can flare up without warning. But if contact tracing, testing and quarantine protocols are as effective as before, and people do not let their guard down, the current situation could come under control within the next week or so, experts said. The Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) cluster, with 27 people infected, is the nation\\'s first hospital cluster and comprises staff and patients. One patient, an 88-year-old woman, has died. The recent cases show that nobody can relax, not even for a moment, stressed Professor Teo Yik Ying, dean of the National University of Singapore\\'s Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health. \"We have seen time and again how countries have had to ramp up restrictions or even reimpose another lockdown after they have opened up, and this scenario could become a reality if we become complacent,\" he warned. \"I certainly hope this is just a blip in our management of Covid-19, and it won\\'t progress on to much further community spread.\" The TTSH cluster - the largest of nine open clusters currently - and the cluster which surfaced at Changi Airport Terminal 1, with eight people infected,so far show that the original index cases had gone on to seed secondary and possibly tertiary transmissions, Prof Teo pointed out. Nonetheless, the clusters could peter out soon if all steps are followed assiduously. \"If our contact tracing, testing and quarantine protocols are as effective as before, we should see the current blip come under control within the next couple of weeks or so,\" Prof Teo predicted. Singapore has already moved to contain the spread of the virus, acting swiftly to ring-fence the cases, testing aggressively and even enforcing lockdowns in four TTSH wards, for instance. Prof Teo said: \"What\\'s critical is cooperation from the public: If you are requested to go for a swab test, please go for it. If you are given a leave of absence, please stick to it. \"And everyone must continue with personal safe management measures such as mask wearing and social distancing.\" The numbers, while alarming, are not large enough to be called a new wave of community infections, noted Associate Professor Alex Cook, vice-dean of research at the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health. The number of community cases now is nowhere near the peak in early April last year, where more than 40 new locally transmitted infections were reported daily, he said. \"Everyone has been quite relaxed with the rules lately and this will be a good reality check for us,\" Prof Cook said. \"It is also a reminder to those who have been putting off their vaccinations to get vaccinated as we cannot expect the community to remain virus-free forever. \"I wouldn\\'t belittle the clusters we\\'re seeing this week - they are a problem we need to get on top of - but they are not currently anywhere near the problem we faced down in 2020,\" Prof Cook said, although he also noted that not all infections would be detected. The extent of the spread will become clearer only in the next few days as cases are detected, Prof Teo added. But there is a good chance that the authorities will be able to break the chains of transmission, given the country\\'s robust contact tracing, quarantine and testing capabilities, which have been built up over more than a year, he said. Prof Teo said Singapore is in a better place than it was a year ago, with more than one fifth of the population vaccinated, better capabilities in testing, a high take up rate of the TraceTogether app, and medical facilities reinforced to cope with some degree of surge. \"While I expect there to be more community cases that will emerge that are linked to the active clusters, the protocols that have worked should once again help to stop transmission,\" he added. The authorities have taken swift action to ringfence current and potential clusters. For instance, after an Edgefield Secondary School studenttested positive for the virus last Friday (April 30), the school will move to home-based learning from Tuesday till Friday (May 4 to 7). Precautionary measures, such as thorough cleaning and disinfecting of the school premises, have also been stepped up. <!--//--><![CDATA[// ><!--iFrameResize()//--><!]]> At TTSH, all 1,100 inpatients and 4,500 staff working in the wards have been tested as part of a mass screening exercise. The four wards involved in the spread are in lockdown. The new spike in cases is a test for Singapore, to gauge how it is managing the pandemic, said Professor Dale Fisher, an infectious diseases expert at the National University Hospital. \"We need to think less in terms of waves, but more in terms of clusters and if we can manage these clusters,\" Prof Fisher said. This is because these local cases are not sweeping through the community, and the approach is about controlling spread from these clusters and breaking transmission chains, Prof Fisher explained. Singapore will have to see if it can shut down the clusters with minimal impact on the rest of society and without resorting to blunt tools like a nationwide lockdown, he said. \"But if there are too many cases and uncontrolled spread, that is when significantly tighter social restrictions will have to come in.\" During the May Day Rally on Saturday, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loonghighlighted the need to tighten measuresto stamp out the clusters and avoid going into another circuit breaker. \"If we have to do another lockdown like last year\\'s circuit breaker, it would be a major setback for our people and for our economic recovery. Let\\'s not make it happen,\" PM Lee said in his televised address. While the nation has honed its defences against the virus, the invisible foe is also becoming more wily. The pandemic has morphed into a different creature compared to last year, with new strains of the virus adding a layer of complexity in Singapore\\'s fight. These strains could prove to be more transmissible, harder to detect, and better able to evade the body\\'s immune system. These variants include Britain\\'s B117 strain, the Brazilian P1 variant, South Africa\\'s B1351 and India\\'s \"double-mutant\" variant, B1617. Cases of reinfections and infections after people have been vaccinated have also surfaced in Singapore and abroad. Though vaccines have been largely effective against these variants, no vaccine is 100 per cent effective, and breakthrough cases remain. More studies need to be done to determine the risk of infection after vaccination and how long vaccine antibodies remain in the immune system, say scientists. \"We need to understand whether the current community clusters are due to the variants, or if they are due to people becoming complacent when socialising and dining together,\" Prof Teo pointed out. \"The situation can deteriorate very rapidly if we let our guard down. We need to keep to the spirit of the rules, which have proven to work, to get through this,\" he said. Join ST\\'s Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.

       " {'text': 'covid 19 jabs best protection against virus despite reinfections and transmission Read 3 articles daily and stand to win ST rewards, including the ST News Tablet worth $398. Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - Singapore has had unlinked cases in the past and venues visited by infected people have been publicised, but that\\'s about all. This time, however, such places will be shut down for two days to undergo deep cleaning. The big question is why? It can\\'t be just that there are more community cases. Eight of the 13 infections forming the cluster at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) are patients who have not been roaming around, so essentially only the five staff members are of concern. Similarly, the cluster around the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority officer was isolated the moment he was diagnosed. One possible reason it is different this time could be the fear that this outbreak may be caused by a viral variant of concern. These are mutations that are believed to spread more easily and cause more severe illness. There are three such mutations - the B117 from Britain, the B1351 from South Africa and the P1 from Brazil. All are of concern and have been identified from imported cases. The variants in India are also worrying given the spread of Covid-19 in the country, although they have yet to be named variants of concern. Could one of these mutated strains have leaked into the community? Is that why TTSH staff who had been fully vaccinated have been infected? Dr Asok Kurup, who chairs the Academy of Medicine\\'s Chapter of Infectious Disease Physicians, said: \"I think we are dealing with a variant or variants which are likely highly transmissible.\" The genome sequence of the virus that spread at TTSH has yet to be completed, so his comment cannot be verified. Associate Professor Kenneth Mak, the Health Ministry\\'s director of medical services, said these processes take time but the possibility cannot be discounted. So the deep cleaning of venues may be a reflection of being kiasu, but this attitude has brought Singapore through the pandemic relatively unscathed. Yes, there have been tens of thousands of infections and 30 deaths, but compared with most countries, Singapore has done well. If the deep cleaning is not needed, well, it is an unnecessary inconvenience. But if the infections are linked to one of the more easily spread mutations, it would be too late to take action by the time the results were available. So frankly, it is far better to take some unnecessary action if such action can help slow the spread of Covid-19 in the community. The latest increase in community cases is also a stark warning to people not to become complacent once they have received both vaccine jabs. Yes, the vaccine does give significant protection, but even at best, that is 95 per cent protection against severe illness. What this means is that out of 20 people who have been fully vaccinated, one could get very sick with Covid-19 should transmission occur within the country. Others might get infected and be mildly sick or even have no symptoms, but there is no guarantee that they will not pass the virus on to someone else. Furthermore, even with the same vaccine, the level of neutralising antibodies varies with individuals. Some will get higher protection than others. And this is with reference to the basic viral strain before mutations complicate the equation. While most of the vaccines in use are believed to give some protection against mutations, the level of protection can vary. Still, vaccinations remain critical as they provide an important protective layer, experts said. They not only reduce the risk of severe illness, but also help to break the chain of transmission should there be an outbreak. Said Associate Professor Hsu Li Yang from the National University of Singapore\\'s (NUS) Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health: \"People who are symptomatic are more likely to spread Covid-19 than those who are asymptomatic.\" So if only about one in 10 to 20 people infected gets sick, there will be far fewer spreading the disease. Professor Ooi Eng Eong of the Duke-NUS Medical School agreed that \"the best way to safeguard our individual health and, at the same time, reduce the risk of outbreaks in Singapore, is to have as many as possible vaccinated and thus protected from Covid-19\". This is especially so for older people with underlying medical problems who could suffer more severe illness if they get infected. Experts also urged that safety measures such as wearing masks, social distancing and frequently washing or sanitising hands be kept up even as more people get vaccinated. Around 1.36 million people here had received at least one dose of the vaccine as at April 18, and about 850,000 have had both. Professor Teo Yik Ying, dean of the NUS Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, said: \"We have always known that the vaccination does not provide absolute protection from infection... I expect we will see a few cases of vaccine breakthrough.\" He added: \"This is the reason why vaccination alone is not the answer to ensuring good control of the outbreak, and there is a need to couple that with sound public health measures like mask wearing and being conscientious about our own health status.\" Hence, the Government\\'s decision to remind people on April 30that the visiting quotas already in place should be adhered to. Education Minister Lawrence Wong, who co-chairs the multi-ministry task force tackling Covid-19, said: \"This is the only way we can ensure that we slow down the spread of the virus in the community. \"And we have to be mentally prepared, too, that if the situation were to worsen, despite all that we are doing and despite all the new restrictions, we may have to consider further tightening and significantly reducing interactions in the community with more stringent measures.\" But if everyone cooperates, perhaps further tightening can be avoided and people here can, with some restrictions, continue life with a great deal of normalcy.

       " {'text': 'thin crowds on public transport in office buildings as singapore returns to phase 2 Read 3 articles daily and stand to win ST rewards, including the ST News Tablet worth $398. Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - Peak-hour road traffic was lighter, there were fewer commuters on trains, and lunchtime crowds weresmaller than usual for a working dayat some placeson Tuesday (May 11), the second weekday after Singapore’s return to phase two of its reopening. When The Straits Times visited office hot spots in Raffles Place, Marina Bay Financial Centre and Buona Vista during the morning rush-hour period and around lunchtime, the areas were generally deserted. Most eateries had no queue during the peak meal periods - except for Toast Box at Marina Bay Link Mall, which saw a constant stream of customers and a queue of up to 10 people at any one time. Following a spike in local community transmissions of Covid-19, stricter measures, such as a cap of five people at social gatheringsand more people required to work from home, kicked in over the weekend on May 8. Under the new rules, no more than 50 per cent of employees who are able to work from home should be in the office at any one time, down from 75 per cent. These measures will last until May 30. At Raffles Place and Marina Bay Link Mall, there was a steady stream of office workers exiting from the train station, but few were congregating at the open spaces outside. Some businesses responded immediately to the tightened measures. Operations executive Serena Lai, 44, said that her company immediately adhered to the new guidelines. She believes that the regulations are necessary to control the outbreak. \"I go in only on alternate days... but my colleagues who were going in on alternate weeks previously now all work from home,\" said Ms Lai, who has been on the job for only a week. Others have been operating at under 50 per cent capacity and did not need to make further changes. For instance, technology firm Verizon, located in Ocean Financial Centre, has since March last year shifted completely to remote work. It allows its over 250 employees to come into office only on a weekly rotational basis. \"We do also request that employees come in only if absolutely necessary,\" said head of human resources Betty Wagglen. Meanwhile, some businesses found the sudden switch disruptive. \"You need to adapt to these changes without time to make plans,\" said 37-year-old consultant S. J. Phua, who now goesto the office four days a month, down from 10 days a month. Some activities such as research and development are also office- or laboratory-bound. Ms Amanpreet Kaur, 34, a research associate at a biomedical research company at Biopolis, said she continues to work a five-day week as she is required to do hands-on laboratory work. \"The administrative staff can work from home but a lot of researchers need to be in their labs and offices,\" added Ms Kaur. Food and beverage businesses felt the immediate impact of lessfootfall, with several eateries ST spoke to already facing a significant dip in customers and revenue. At bakery and cafe chain Cedele at The Metropolis, sales have dropped by 10 to 20 per cent amid the tightened measures. The outlet has also started reducing manpower. Cafe chain Attap House had seven outlets island wide, but had to shut down three due to the pandemic. One of the outlets still standing is at The Metropolis. \"Sales have dropped but I am not worried because the SGX and P&G offices are nearby and they are still operating at 50 per cent capacity,\" said Attap House\\'s manager, Mr Gringo Manlongat. Ms Chew Lee Ching, one of the vice-presidents at the Association of Small andMedium Enterprises, said that SMEs find it hard to adjust to sudden changes. But they also understand the need to do so. \"There have been a lot of stops and starts, and a lot of adjustments to be made,\" said Ms Chew. \"The greater concern... (is) a complete lockdown.\" She also hopes that it will not be too long before measures are eased. \"We have been told these measures are in place till the end of May, but we hope it will not be prolonged... this new (Covid-19) variant seems to be more infectious, and that\\'s very worrying, so we don\\'t want the situation to deteriorate further.\" Additional reporting by Eleanor Yeo, Sherlyn Sim and Gabrielle Ng Join ST\\'s Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.

       " {'text': 'malls bracing themselves for less business as entry restrictions return Read 3 articles daily and stand to win ST rewards, including the ST News Tablet worth $398. Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - Medical sales assistant Katherine Tan, 63, was one of the tenants and employees at Lucky Plaza whose happiness was short-lived when they learnt the odd-and-even entry restrictions were back. She said: \"We were so happy to welcome the crowds back, but suddenly the community cases (of Covid-19) happened again.\" The multi-ministry task force (MTF) announced on Friday night (April 30) that safe management measures at malls would be tightened again, with the recent rise in cases of the coronavirus infection here. Shopping malls, which had entry restrictions imposed in April last year and eased in December, are now back to square one. Till May 14, the capacity limit for malls and large standalone stores has been reduced, with each person needing 10 sq m of space, instead of 8 sq m. Peninsula Plaza and Lucky Plaza will also have entry restrictions reinstated on Sundays that let only those whose identification numbers end in even digits visit on even dates, and those whose numbers end in odd digits visit on odd dates. Those restrictions were put in place in August last year and lifted only on April 10. Outdoor barbecue pits - including those in parks, HDB estates, condominiums and country clubs - and campsites will also be closed to the public. Said Ms Tan, who works in a medicine shop in Lucky Plaza: \"It is better to have restrictions as everyone is safe. However, business will go down.\" She added her boss will likely feel the pinch, especially since the peak crowd is on Sunday. Lucky Plaza is a weekend hotspot for foreign workers. Domestic helper Edna Nacianceno, 49, usually goes there every Saturday to run errands like sending money home to the Philippines. She said: \"I feel safer with the odd-even scheme. I don\\'t want to go out on Sunday, as it is very crowded. But with the scheme, the crowd is more regulated.\" There were no crowds at Peninsula Plaza, United Square and Velocity @ Novena Square, when The Sunday Times visited between 11am and 1pm on Saturday. Ms Corina Teo, who chairs Peninsula Plaza\\'s MCST management council, said the tightening will reduce the mall’s capacity limit for shoppers by 20 per cent. Four safe distancing ambassadors (SDAs) were seen at Peninsula Plaza, and two at United Square. At least seven SDAs were spotted at Velocity @ Novena Square, patrolling in pairs. Velocity @ Novena Square is a stone’s throw from Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH), where a Covid-19 cluster was identified last week. The task force said on Friday that public agencies in the Novena area will ask their staff to work from home where possible, to lower the risk of transmission. Tenants at Velocity @ Novena Square said this could hit business on weekdays. Said Ms Kim Tan, 66, who runs a pushcart stall selling Indonesian cakes and snacks: \"Most of the crowd here are people working nearby and visitors to TTSH. Since they will be working from home again and fewer people are allowed at the hospital, business might be slow on weekdays for the next few weeks.\" Shoppers at the mall, however, said it was unnecessary to avoid the Novena area. Ms Evon Yip, 64, who goes there for fitness classes every day, felt it was still safe to go to shopping malls. She said: \"More people are getting vaccinated and TTSH is doing a good job containing the spread of the virus. The stores recently visited by the Covid-19 patients have also been closed for cleaning, so there is nothing to worry about.\" The task force also revealed public places visited by individuals during their infectious period included Junction 8 and Bugis Junction, both managed by CapitaLand. It said the places identified will be closed for two days for cleaning, and to facilitate the testing of staff. In response to queries Saturday, CapitaLand, as well as the UOL Group, which runs Velocity @ Novena Square and United Square, said the main touchpoints and common areas in their malls were being cleaned and disinfected more frequently. Though some felt the restrictions represent a setback, most tenants and shoppers expressed optimism that the measures would help stem more transmissions. Ms Yip said: “We have made a lot of progress during the pandemic, it does not make sense for us to be complacent now.” Join ST\\'s Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - Experts have warned that the Covid-19 crisis in Singapore could worsen quickly amid a growing number of unlinked cases and expanding clusters, but some here are still not seeing a doctor after developing symptoms. The Covid-19 situation here is on a knife-edge, Education Minister Lawrence Wong said when he addressed Parliament on Tuesday (May 11). The experts agree. Speaking during his ministerial address on the pandemic, Mr Wong, who co-chairs the multi-ministry task force tackling the pandemic, said that the nation has a chance of getting things under control by the end of the month. But he also warned against complacency, saying that the country\\'s community case numbers can go either way over the next few weeks, and it will only take one lapse or one irresponsible action for a potential super-spreading event to occur. As of Thursday, there were 11 active clusters here, with 15 unlinked cases in the community over the past week. Professor Dale Fisher, from the Department of Medicine at the National University of Singapore\\'s Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, said he \"couldn\\'t agree more\" with Mr Wong\\'s statement. The choice is between either controlling the increasing cases or clusters, or having to go into a second circuit breaker, he said. \"Lockdowns are very blunt but could be necessary if unlinked cases and new clusters continue to emerge. Now, as a community, we can act and hopefully avoid the restrictions becoming mandated by government,\" he said. Dr Hannah Clapham, Assistant Professor at the NUS Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, noted that this is not the first time Singaporeans have been told the situation is at a potential tipping point. However, she added: \"Unfortunately, it continues to be true each time. Because there has been a swift and effective response, we have not yet seen any of these tipping points turn into full blown community outbreaks. \"But it is exactly because the measures have been put in place that this hasn\\'t happened, and this is what we are seeing now - the potential for lots of cases and therefore a tipping point. More measures are brought in to ensure this does not happen.\" She added that the measures needed to keep things under control should decrease over time as more people here get vaccinated. As of May 9, about 1.8 million people here had received at least one dose of the vaccine. Of this number, about 1.2 million had received their second dose as well. Prof Fisher added that Singapore has not been in this state of the pandemic for \"a long time\". Pointing to the unlinked cases and number of clusters that are developing, he added: \"Furthermore, Tan Tock Seng Hospital has lost a lot of its capacity, so that adds to the concerns over Singapore\\'s hospital response.\" The past week has also seen 14 Covid-19 cases who did not seek medical attention immediately despite developing symptoms of the coronavirus. In one case, a 42-year-old man who works as an operating theatre technician at Ng Teng Fong General Hospital, developed a cough on April 21, but did not seek medical treatment until May 10 - nearly three weeks later - after his cough worsened. Dr Clapham said that such cases are especially concerning, and that people should seek medical attention when they develop symptoms. \"It is ideal if cases are detected as soon as possible, as this enables contact tracing to occur and other measures to be brought in as needed to control this transmission chain before we see many cases occurring,\" she explained. Both experts urged people here to get vaccinated when they have the chance, follow safe management measures and see a doctor if they develop symptoms. Prof Fisher added: \"We all can do well to just go out less for the next few weeks... Nobody wants a circuit breaker, but we know the Government will do it if necessary.\" Join ST\\'s Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.

SINGAPORE - The Shangri-La Dialogue scheduled for June 4 to 5 in the Republic has been cancelled, the organisers announced on Thursday (May 20). A spokesman for the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) said it was \"with regret and sadness\" that the security summit had to be called off. It was previously announced that the dialogue would be a fully in-person event held within a bubble at Shangri-La Hotel. United States Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin had confirmed his attendance, while Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga had been invited to headline the event as keynote speaker. “Unfortunately, the global Covid-19 situation has recently deteriorated, in part because of the rise of infectious new Covid variants,” said the IISS spokesman. “In Singapore, there has been a rise in local cases, recently introduced new restrictions, and the prospect of further tightening cannot be ruled out – all of which creates uncertainty. Taken together, all of these various factors mean that holding an in-person Shangri-La Dialogue this year has become unviable.” A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence said it supported the decision to cancel the dialogue “due to the continued uncertainties surrounding the global and local Covid-19 situation”. Singapore’s Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen also posted on Facebook, saying that earlier this year, IISS and Mindef were “quietly optimistic” that control measures and mass vaccinations under way in many countries would allow for a physical meeting in the Republic in June. On the cancellation, he said: “Although regretful, it is the responsible course, with the health and safety of the local community and participants as the foremost consideration.” As recently as Monday, the IISS had reaffirmed its intentions to continue with the dialogue, in the wake of the World Economic Forum cancelling its special annual meeting scheduled to be held in Singapore in August. The think-tank had said the same after a spike in local infections was reported last week. On Thursday, the IISS spokesman noted that a \"wide range\" of defence ministers, senior officials, corporate leaders and influential strategists from Asia, North America, the Middle East and Europe had confirmed their attendance. Dr Ng said Singapore was heartened by the positive responses to the invitations, especially from Mr Suga and many defence ministers. “Their commitment to be here in Singapore physically reflected the strong desire to have meaningful dialogue to deal with pressing transnational security issues that confront us all,” he wrote. “The cancellation of the Shangri-La Dialogue in no way reflects any reduced commitment to dialogue and engagement to promote peace and stability in Asia and beyond. Rather, it is yet another example of how Covid-19 has disrupted normalcy, in all facets of our lives and social discourse. We will find alternate and safer avenues for these important goals.” The IISS spokesman said the institute would plan for the return of the full in-person Shangri-La Dialogue in the middle of next year. The cancellation of the Shangri-La Dialogue and World Economic Forum leaves the Bloomberg New Economy Forum, scheduled for Nov 16 to 19, as the only signature event on Singapore’s calendar. If it proceeds, the conference will gather government leaders and top businessmen around the world – including Tesla boss Elon Musk – to discuss the global challenges of the day.

       " {'text': 'construction firms set to be able to seek relief for increased foreign manpower Read 3 articles daily and stand to win ST rewards, including the ST News Tablet worth $398. Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - Construction firms here will soon be able to seek relief for higher foreign manpower costs from their contract partners if their workers\\' salaries have been affected as a result of Covid-19-related measures. This will be done through an amendment to the Covid-19 (Temporary Measures) Act Bill that was introduced in Parliament on Monday (May 10). The draft law comes as construction firms here grapple with increased manpower costs due to entry restrictions set by the Government on workers from countries such as India and Bangladesh due to surging Covid-19 cases there, which has constricted the pool of foreign workers here. Manpower costs may also come under pressure should source countries impose travel restrictions on their citizens and residents due to the pandemic, which preventsthem from travelling to Singapore to work. The Covid-19 (Temporary Measures) (Amendment No. 3) Bill was tabled on a Certificate of Urgency, which allows the proposed law to be fast-tracked through all three readings in one parliamentary sitting. Under the amended law, affected contractors, including sub-contractors, may apply to the authorities for an assessor to adjust the contract sum to take into account an increase in foreign manpower salary incurred between Oct 1 last year and Sept 30 this year due to reasons relating to Covid-19. Contractors must first show that they have made a reasonable attempt to negotiate with the other party to adjust the contract sum. They must also serve a copy of the application to involved parties, including their contract partner and any guarantor or surety. To be able to tap on this relief, both parties must have entered into a contract before Oct 1 last year, with construction works not yet completed as atMay 10. This includes contracts for public sector projects. The amendment, however, does not apply to construction contracts for works at or on any residential property that do not require the approval of the Commissioner of Building Control under the Building Control Act. When appointed, the assessor will determine whether there has been an increase in foreign manpower salary costs. He will also determine whether it is \"just and equitable\" to adjust the contract sum to take into account the additional costs. If so, the assessor will then determine the adjusted amount, which will be enforced in the same manner as a judgment or court order. No appeal will be allowed. The registrar may also reject an application if information provided by the contractor is deemed to be false or misleading. This is the third amendment to the Covid-19 (Temporary Measures) Act, which seeks to provide relief to businesses and individuals whose contracts have been impacted by the pandemic. In the second amendment to the law that was passed last month, construction firms were given an additional six months\\' reprievefrom legal and enforcement action for their building and supply contracts, until Sept 30.

Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs Masagos Zulkifli told the community on Wednesday (May 12): \"Following the fresh outbreak of cases locally, tighter measures have been reintroduced. I understand that many of you are disappointed. \"However, I am grateful that many of you understood why this was necessary. I urge the community to be calm and patient as we do our part for our collective safety.\" Muslims are facing increased restrictions at social gatherings as Singapore moves to fight a rise in community infections. People can gather only in groups of five, down from eight previously, until May 30, while households can now receive only five distinct visitors a day. Still, it is a marked improvement from last year\\'s Hari Raya, which fell seven weeks into Singapore\\'s circuit breaker, when visiting was forbidden. Families then had to send greetings to one another on video-conferencing platforms like Zoom. Mr Masagos touched on the improved situation, thanking mosque officers, volunteers and healthcare workers for making some practices such as tarawih prayers possible, albeit with limited capacities. Tarawih prayers are special night prayers held only during Ramadan. \"Indeed, this would not be possible without our community\\'s resilience and solidarity in fighting the pandemic with the rest of Singapore,\" he said. Mr Masagos also used his Hari Raya message to talk about the work that Muslims here have done during Ramadan to help the poor, both within and beyond the community.\"Our community exemplified the value of Blessings to All, or Rahmatan Lil Alamin,\" he said. \"For example, organisations and volunteers, including from other faiths, came together under the Rahmatan Lil Alamin Foundation\\'s Blessings to All project to deliver over 20,000 meals to low-income families and migrant workers.\" Mr Masagos also asked Muslims to remain vigilant and to celebrate Hari Raya safely and responsibly so that the community\\'s collective sacrifices would not bein vain. \"May we be blessed with good health and may Ramadan and Hari Raya next year be better than this year,\" he added.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - City Harvest Church, a foodcourt at the National University of Singapore (NUS) and popular malls were among places visited by Covid-19 patients while they were still infectious, said the Ministry of Health on Thursday (April 29). A foodcourt at NUS Bukit Timah Campus known as The Summit was visited on four separate occasions between April 15 and Tuesday. A 39-year-old cleaner who helps out at a food stall there was the sole unlinked community case announced on Thursday. A Starbucks outlet at the Nanyang Technological University was visited on April 17 between 11.30am and 1pm. Hajjah Fatimah Mosque was visited on four occasions between April 15 and April 17. It was among the six mosques closed temporarily on Thursday because of visits by Covid-19 patients. The others are Petempatan Melayu Sembawang, Abdul Hamid Kampung Pasiran, Al-Falah, Yusof Ishak,and Al-Iman mosques. City Harvest Church was visited on April 17, April 23 and Tuesday. Places at popular malls, including Junction 8, Ang Mo Kio Hub and VivoCity, were also added to the list. Other locations included eateries Carousel at Royal Plaza on Scotts and Tuk Tuk Cha at Bugis Junction, and retail store Uniqlo at Orchard Central. As a precautionary measure, people who were at these locations during the specified times should monitor their health closely for 14 days from their date of visit, said the Health Ministry. Those identified as close contacts of confirmed cases would already have been notified. They should see a doctor if they develop symptoms of acute respiratory infection - such as a cough, sore throat and runny nose - as well as fever and loss of taste or smell, and inform the doctor of their exposure history. People may access the SafeEntry Location Matching Self-Check service via the TraceTogether App, SingPass Mobile, or at this website to check whether they were at these locations during the times in question, from their own SafeEntry records.

Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - Tighter curbs to stem the rise in Covid-19 cases here have led to questions by many in the sports sector on what can and cannot be done. Following the announcement on Friday (May 14) of the tightening of measures by the multi-ministry task force, Sport Singapore has released details responding to frequently asked questions relating to group sizes for sports and physical activities, and low-intensity activities in indoor facilities. Q: What is the maximum number of people who can exercise in a group? A: From May 16 to June 13, sports and physical activities must be confined to groups of no more than two individuals. The physical distancing of 2m between individuals, except when the nature of the sport does not permit so, and 3m between groups of up to two individuals must be maintained while exercising and playing sports. Q: What is the maximum number of people a sports facility can accommodate? A: All sports/recreational facilities can admit only a maximum number of people according to its gross floor area based on 16 sq m per person, up to a maximum of 50 people, instead of 10 sq m per person. No facility, regardless of size, shall admit more than 50 people. Q: Can there be large group sports and physical activities classes? A: For organised programmes and indoor classes, multiple groups of two remain allowable up to 30 participants or the capacity limit of the venue, whichever is lower. The groups of two are not to intermingle and must remain 3m apart. For organised programmes and outdoor classes, multiple groups of two remain allowable up to 30 participants or the capacity limit of the venue, whichever is lower, if the activity is of low intensity with masks on at all times. If the activity is of high intensity where masks have to be removed, only two people are allowed (including instructor or coach) and there can be no multiple groups of two. Q: Will I be allowed to swim? A: Yes, you are allowed to swim outdoors as an individual or in a group of no more than two people, including yourself. Q: Will I be allowed to golf in a four-ball flight? A: You are allowed to golf in a four-ball flight in two groups of two people with masks on and keeping 3m between the two groups at all times. If masks are unable to be worn throughout, only a two-ball flight is allowed. Q: Will I be allowed to play sports such as badminton, basketball and table tennis? A: You are allowed to play sports such as badminton, basketball and table tennis in a group of no more than two people (that is, two individuals playing against each other). Masks must be worn at all times when playing sports indoors; masks may be taken off during strenuous activity outdoors, in a group of no more than two people. Q: We are a family of four. Can we exercise outdoors together? A: Individuals from the same household can exercise together but should split into pairs and maintain safe distancing between individuals (2m) and different groups (3m) while exercising. Q: What sports and physical activities are allowed indoors? A: Only low-intensity sports and physical activities with masks on at all times are allowed in indoor sports and recreation facilities. The activity has to cease immediately if any participant removes his or her mask. Q: What indoor facilities are to be closed and for how long? A: From May 8 to June 13, all indoor facilities, including gyms, fitness studios, sports halls, indoor swimming pools and squash courts, are to close, unless they offer only low-intensity physical activities, sports and exercises where all participants and instructors are wearing masks at all times, and where there is no sharing or supply of any common equipment. Participants, instructors and staff also have to adhere to a more stringent set of safe management measures (SMMs) indicated in the updated SportSG guidelines. No such facility will be allowed to offer weight, strength or resistance training of any form, and/or provide equipment for such training, as these are associated with strenuous activities. Other indoor facilities similar to gym and studio settings that remain in operation are to modify their activities to be in line with the more stringent SMMs. Q: What are some examples of low-intensity sports/physical activities? A: These are activities that can be done with masks on at all times such as yoga, pilates, stretching exercises and tai chi. There may have to be some modifications to how the activity is done, for example, without the use of equipment, during this period. Q: I run a private sports academy (for example, gymnastics, martial arts, combat sports) in an indoor setting similar to a studio. Do I need to close? A: No, you do not have to close but the activities being offered will have to be modified as per the guidelines below. You will also need to factor in the reduced group size and facility capacity, as well as enhanced measures indicated in the updated SportSG guidelines. These apply to activities such as taekwondo, mixed martial arts, muay thai, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, fencing, judo, boxing and other similar activities. The private sports academies that continue to open must: - Modify their activities to minimise contact as much as possible. Keep total grappling time to no more than 15 minutes in total per session. - Ensure that participants and instructors wear masks at all times, refraining from conducting activities that are strenuous to the point that they feel the need to remove their masks. - Not provide common equipment such as punching pads, bags, dummies and boxing rings, where fomites transmission risk is high. - Not offer weight, strength or resistance training or cardio training of any form, and/or provide equipment for such training, such that they become strenuous activities. - Keep to their cohorts to limit the extent of any contact tracing. Q: Are sports such as table tennis, basketball, badminton and volleyball allowed indoors? A: All indoor activities have to be changed to low intensity with masks on in a group of no more than two people (that is, two individuals playing against each other). While practice drills may still be possible, competitive sports will typically be high intensity and if allowed to proceed, would put participants at risk of flouting the law. Venue operators are being advised to ensure that competitive sports do not take place and masks are worn at all times. ActiveSG may disallow competitive sports to take place at its venues. Q: I have a mixed-purpose facility that has a weights-training gym, exercise studio, outdoor pool and spa. Am I required to close? A: The gym should be closed while the others may open if you are able to offer low-intensity physical activities, sports and exercises where all participants and instructors are wearing masks at all times and your participants, instructors and staff adhere to a more stringent set of SMMs as indicated in the updated SportSG guidelines. None of your facilities are allowed to offer weight, strength or resistance training of any form, and/or provide equipment for such training, as these are associated with strenuous activities. Q: I run a yoga/pilates studio. Do the new measures affect me? A: If you are able to offer low-intensity physical activities, sports and exercises where all participants and instructors are wearing masks at all times and your participants, instructors and staff adhere to a more stringent set of SMMs as indicated in the updated SportSG guidelines, you may remain open. Sharing of common equipment should be avoided so your participants should not share sports and exercise equipment, such as exercise mats where fomites transmission risk is high. No premises that remain open is to provide such equipment for use. In addition, your facility must not offer weight, strength or resistance training of any form, and/or provide equipment for such training, as these are associated with strenuous activities. If you intend to pivot to provide rehabilitative therapy and require equipment such as the reformer to be used, you may do so subject to the following conditions: - The business has to choose to pivot in total for this period and cease providing group classes. All treatment will be one-on-one only and by appointment. There can be multiple therapists, each with one client. All of them cannot intermingle. - The business has to maintain a case file on the patient/client, recording his disability or reasons requiring therapy as proof of the rehabilitation treatment. This should be made available if required by the relevant health authorities. - The therapist and patient/client should keep their masks on at all times. Q: I run a yoga class for children below six years old. Do my young participants need to don masks? A: Masks are not required by law to be worn by children under six years old, but it would be good practice for them to do so whenever possible. Q: I run a gym/exercise studio and I'm prepared to impose mask-on for my programmes/activities. Can I still continue to open? A: If all your participants, instructors and staff adhere to a more stringent set of SMMs as indicated in the updated SportSG guidelines, including wearing masks at all times and complying with the reduced group size and density, you may remain open. Your facility must not offer weight, strength or resistance training of any form, and/or provide equipment for such training as these are associated with strenuous activities. Q: Can I continue to conduct one-on-one sessions at my gym/fitness/exercise studio? A: If your sports/physical activities are of low intensity and your participants, instructors and staff adhere to a more stringent set of SMMs as indicated in the updated SportSG guidelines, including being mask-on at all times, you may remain open. Your facility must not offer weight, strength or resistance training of any form, and/or provide equipment for such training as these are associated with strenuous activities. Q: Can I conduct my fitness classes/one-on-one sessions outdoors? A: Yes, you may, subject to prevailing SMMs. Instructors who are interested to conduct large outdoor classes of up to 30 individuals at outdoor public spaces must be registered. Please see this website for more information. Q: I am moving my classes at the outdoor area near to my indoor facility. Can my participants enter to use the toilet/shower facilities in my gym/exercise studios after they are done with the physical activity? A: Yes, they may use the toilet/shower facilities subject to prevailing SMMs such as facility capacity and safe distancing. You have to ensure that they do not linger in the premises or use any of the equipment within. If you are not able to ensure participants' compliance to the necessary SMMs, you are advised to close off the toilet/shower facilities. Do seek the approval of the venue owner of the outdoor location that you will be using, before you move your classes outdoors. Q: I am a freelance instructor and the gym/fitness/exercise studio that I provide my services to is closed. Can I conduct my classes with up to two people at home? A: You are strongly discouraged from doing so. From May 16 to June 13, the maximum number of distinct visitors per household per day is also reduced to two. As the intent is to reduce the risk of further community spread in this period of heightened alert, we strongly discourage sports providers from hosting physical fitness classes for up to two people in residential premises due to the high intensity and close contact nature of the activity. We seek the cooperation of all sports providers to remain unified and disciplined in our fight against Covid-19, and to keep our loved ones and community safe. Q: I run a gym/fitness/exercise studio and am not able to pivot to offer low-intensity sports/physical activities. Can I get approval to do filming at my gym/studio for the purpose of online classes? A: Premises can be used by a coach/instructor for the purposes of producing digital content for online classes. SportSG will have to be notified beforehand at Sport–Covid@sport.gov.sg to confirm adherence to prevailing SMMs for digital content production. There shall be no other activities at the premises when digital content production is taking place. Q: I am not able to pivot to offer low-intensity sports/physical activities. Can I come back to my gym/fitness/exercise studios for administrative work during the closure? A: You may enter your premises and conduct administrative tasks, including for filming of online classes, subject to all prevailing SMMs. Do check back with SportSG when in doubt. You can e-mail the SportSG QSM at this website. Government agencies will be conducting inspections. Enforcement actions under the Covid-19 (Temporary Measures) Act will be taken against businesses or individuals who fail to comply with SMMs. Q: I run a gym/fitness/exercise studio and have to close as I am not able to offer low-intensity sports/physical activities within the stricter SMMs. Are there grants to assist me? A: The Ministry of Culture, Community & Youth and SportSG will be enhancing measures under the Sports Resilience Package to support industry operators affected by the announced closure of indoor gymnasiums and fitness studios. These will build upon existing measures that our sports industry stakeholders can currently tap on. More details will be announced by SportSG in due course. Q: Why are high-intensity classes such as martial arts and combat sports still allowed to take place? A: High-intensity activities are only allowed in settings that are not similar to indoor gyms/studios (for example, outdoors or large halls). These classes are commonly held based on cohorts (for example, same class time, same participants, same venue) and this generally limits the risk exposure to the same cohort. However, if these classes are held in settings similar to gym/studios, they will need to modify their activities as per the guidelines below, and factor in the reduced group size and facility capacity, as well as enhanced measures. These apply to activities such as taekwondo, mixed martial arts, muay thai, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, fencing, judo, boxing and other similar activities. The operators whose classes are held in settings similar to gyms/studios must: - Modify their activities to minimise contact as much as possible. Keep total grappling time to no more than 15 minutes in total per session. - Ensure that participants and instructors are masked on at all times, refraining from conducting activities that are strenuous to the point that they feel the need to remove their masks. - Not provide common equipment such as punching pads, bags, dummies, use of boxing ring, et cetera, where fomite transmission risk is high. - Not offer weight, strength or resistance training or cardio training of any form, and/or provide equipment for such training, such that they become strenuous activities. - Keep to their cohorts to limit the extent of any contact tracing. Q: I am a facility owner. Can I rent out my facility space for physical activities/sport use? A: You may rent out your facility spaces for low-intensity exercises/sports where participants are masked on at all times and are in compliance with the stricter SMMs found in the annex in the updated SportSG guidelines. If in doubt, you can e-mail the SportSG QSM at this website. Join ST's Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.

       " {'text': \"singapore maintains 2021 gdp forecast at 4 6 per cent covid 19 14879984 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: Singapore has maintained its growth forecast for 2021 at a range of 4 to 6 per cent in view of “heightened uncertainties” arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) said on Tuesday (May 25). The forecast will be reviewed again in the next quarter when there is “more data and greater clarity” over the global and domestic economic situations, it added. The decision comes despite data showing the economy putting up a stronger-than-expected showing in the first quarter of the year. Gross domestic product grew by 1.3 per cent year-on-year between January and March, propped up by gains in the manufacturing, finance and insurance, and wholesale trade sectors. This was much higher than the advance estimates of 0.2 per cent growth and marked Singapore’s first quarterly expansion since the pandemic erupted a year ago. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjustedbasis, the economy grew by 3.1 per cent between January and March, also surpassing the advance forecast of 2 per cent growth. TIGHTER CURBS A SETBACK FOR SOME SECTORS In its report, MTI said the external economic environment has improved since February, even though the pandemic continues to disrupt economic activities around the world. Following a stronger-than-expected performance in the first quarter, the domestic economy “should still see a recovery this year” amid the global economic rebound and further progress in the local vaccination programme. That said, the recent tightening of COVID-19 curbs marks a setback for some sectors, it added. To combat a recent spike in local COVID-19 infections, Singapore entered what authorities called a “heightened alert” of Phase 2 on May 16, which included a new limit of two people for all social gatherings, a ban on dining in at restaurants and a return to working from home as the default. Thisslew of measures will be in place until Jun 13. Singapore has also tightened border controls, including aban on long-term pass holders and short-term visitors from Indiawhere the outbreak has worsened. These will likely lead to a recovery that is “more uneven than earlier expected”, MTI said in its quarterly report. For instance, outward-oriented sectors including manufacturing and wholesale trade, are expected to benefit from the pick-up in external demand. But tourism and aviation-related sectors are set to see further delays in recovery given the slower lifting of global travel curbs and the recent cut in capacity limits at local attractions. Activity in these sectors will remain “significantly below pre-COVID levels” even by the end of the year, the ministry added. The recovery in the construction and marine and offshore engineering sectors will also be significantlyimpeded by severe manpower shortages. These have been exacerbated by the latest border restrictions and the need to comply with safe management measures, MTI said. SIGNIFICANT DOWNSIDE RISKS MTI also flagged “significant downside risks” that could stand in the way of the Singapore economy outperforming the 4 per cent to 6 per cent forecast range for this year. Top on the list is the trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic, with countries experiencing recurring waves of infections given the emergence of more transmissible strains of the virus, the easing of safety restrictions and delays in vaccinating populations. These resurgences, as well as the countries’ public health responses, will inevitably affect their economic growth, MTI said. “As these countries include some of our major economic partners in our region, the uncertainty in their outlook also affects Singapore,” it added. There are also significant risks and uncertainties when it comes to the local COVID-19 situation, even though it is “generally well under control” with “good progress” being made with the vaccination of the population. “These non-economic risks can have a major impact on our GDP growth this year,” the ministry said. MTI’s Permanent Secretary Gabriel Lim said the decision to maintain the existing forecast range is “reasonable at this point in time”, and does not indicate a bullish outlook. He added that the stricter restrictions on social gatherings and dine-ins will impact some sectors such as retail and F&B, but it is “not something that necessitates at this point in time a downgrade in the overall forecast”. At the same time, there are other sectors in the economy that are not affected by these curbs, with some like manufacturing still having a “reasonably strong” outlook. “We believe that holding on at 4 to 6 per cent is reasonable at this point in time based on what we know, and we think that it is also enough to accommodate some of the downside risks that are mentioned,” said Mr Lim. Asked about the outlook for the local labour market, a Ministry of Manpower (MOM) official said recovery will likely continue to be a gradual one. Mr Kenny Tan, the ministry's divisional director of manpower planning and policy division,noted some “directional improvements”, such as total employment in Singapore expanding in the first quarter of this year after four straight quarters of declines. But the looming uncertainties and an uneven recovery could see businesses holding off hiring. “A combination of these effects means that labour market recovery will continue to still be gradual and there'll still be some uncertainty in terms of whether employees are prepared to add a permanent headcount to their workforce.” On monetary policy, the central bank said its decision last month to maintain a zero rate of appreciation for its exchange rate-based monetary policy remains appropriate. “The April policy statement had emphasised the risks to the outlook – both downsides and upsides,” said Mr Edward Robinson, the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s (MAS) deputy managing director. “In policy formulation for monetary policy, we do careful scenario analysis to confirm the robustness of the policy stance to short term uncertainty around the baseline.” The MAS will have its next monetary policy meeting in October as scheduled. “We will carefully review all factors relevant to the inflation outlook, as well as growth,” said Mr Robinson.

       " {'text': 'india accepts oxygen supply from 40 countries including singapore Read 3 articles daily and stand to win ST rewards, including the ST News Tablet worth $398. Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. NEW DELHI - India, which until a few weeks ago was a global supplier of vaccines and medicines, is now depending on help pouring in from over 40 countries, rich and poor, in a sign of how Covid-19 can quickly change fortunes. Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla said at a press conference on Thursday (April 29) that nations, including Singapore, were sending close to 550 oxygen generating plants, 4,000 oxygen concentratorsand 10,000 oxygen cylinders, as well as medicines such as the antivirals remdesivir and favipiravir. International support has become crucial for India, where people in cities like Delhi are in desperate need of oxygen and medicines. The Republic of Singapore Air Force sent 256 oxygen cylinders on board two C-130 planes from Singapore to West Bengal on Wednesday, while four cryogenic oxygen containers were airlifted by the Indian Air Force last Saturday. India, which escaped relatively unscathed in the first wave last year, has been hit by a far more infectious second wave. It reported 379,257 cases on Thursday, its biggest one-day spike, and the highest daily deaths of 3,645. Some of the aid was requested by India, and some was offered, including by smaller neighbours Bhutan and Bangladesh, which has offered 10,000 vials of injectable anti-viral medication. Mr Shringla said countries had expressed appreciation for help earlier rendered by India. \"The situation now, we have never seen before and will never see. This is an unprecedented situation we are dealing with. We have prioritised items we need but many countries have come forward on their own to offer us assistance,\" he said. He noted that the help was also coming from Indian firms bringing in supplies and Indian communities around the world supplementing efforts. \"Countries said they appreciated our assistance and they\\'re giving us in return.\" Mr Shringla said the pandemic had highlighted what it meant to live in an interdependent world. The South Asian country had rolled out an ambitious vaccine export programme rivalling China\\'s vaccine diplomacy in a move to fortify its international influence. Apart from donating and exporting vaccines, India had also sent medicines to different countries, including hydroxychloroquine to the US. India is the world\\'s third-largest producer of drugs and supplies nearly 60 per cent of the global demand for vaccines, but is now facing shortages at home. In just one instance of the crisis, India produces 60,000 doses of remdesivir per day but demand has soared to 300,000 to 400,000 a day, said Mr Shringla. Some observers have noted the shift in India\\'s longstanding policy of not accepting external help in a crisis. India refused to take tsunami relief in 2004 and similarly turned down aid offers following a flood in Uttarakhand in 2013. Professor Harsh V. Pant, the director of studies at the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi, said in this case, India was responding to an exceptional situation. \"This is a humanitarian crisis. India would like to get as much help from wherever it\\'s able to. Many of the countries are saying that India stood up in a time of need and they are reciprocating,\" said Prof Pant. \"I think this is something that doesn\\'t change the fundamental logic of India\\'s aid policy, where the idea was to manage on our own. That\\'s what (former Prime Minister) Manmohan Singh did in 2004. A lot of what is happening now is emergency procurement of medicine and concentrators. \"Once it stabilises, this kind of procurement would end and the larger policy will remain.\" India\\'s rivals, Pakistan and China, have also offered help. Pakistan allowed overflight to an EU aid flight and has offered relief, including ventilators. The country\\'s ties with China deteriorated following border skirmishes last year in which both sides suffered casualties. While ties have not been normalised, China\\'s foreign minister, Mr Wang Yi, on Thursday sent \"a message of sympathy\" to his Indian counterpart, Mr S. Jaishankar, reiterating support from China. \"Chinese medical suppliers are working overtime on orders from India, at least 25,000 orders for oxygen concentrators in recent days. Cargo planes are under plan for medical supplies. Chinese Customs will facilitate the relevant process,\" Chinese ambassador to India Sun Weidong tweeted on Wednesday.

Nineteeninfections are linked to previous cases, whiletwo community cases are currently unlinked. Among them, 12 cases had been placed on quarantine earlier. There were also three imported cases, who wereplaced on stay-home notice or isolated upon arrival in Singapore, said the Ministry of Health(MOH). In all, Singapore reported 25 new COVID-19 cases on Sunday. FIRST DORMITORY CASE SINCE MAY 1 A 46-year-old Malaysian man is Singapore's first dormitory case since May 1; his case is currently unlinked. He works as a construction worker at H&W Communications and resides at Harvest @ Woodlandsat 280 Woodlands Industrial Park E5. He is asymptomatic and his infection was detected on May 22 as part of rostered routine testing. He was immediately isolated. The man's earlier tests - the last being on May 8 - were negative for COVID-19, MOH said. Another resident of Block 506 Hougang Avenue 8 has tested positive for COVID-19. The 60-year-old Singaporean woman's infection was detected May 22 as part of MOH testing operations for residents of the block.

       " {'text': 'amended law allows for fairer sharing of covid led higher construction costs Read 3 articles daily and stand to win ST rewards, including the ST News Tablet worth $398. Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - Construction firms here can soon apply to the authorities to seek adjustments to contract sums, after the law was amended so that project partners will more equitably share in increased foreign manpower costs resulting from Covid-19. \"This is to ensure no single stakeholder group in the construction industry bears an undue share of the burden imposed by Covid-19,\" said National Development Minister Desmond Lee in his speech on the amendment to the Covid-19 (Temporary Measures) Act that was passed in Parliament on Tuesday (May 11). Mr Lee noted that construction projects involve many parties, often in \"long, interlocking contractual value chains\", with the implication that should one party fail, the entire project might be put at risk. The supply of foreign workers, which had already shrunk over the past year because of pandemic restrictions, has effectively dried up after the Government placed a ban on new arrivals from countries like India and Bangladesh due to surging Covid-19 cases in those countries. Median wages for construction work permit holders in March were 15 to 30 per cent higher thanin pre-Covid-19 times due to competition for the limited supply of workers. Thishas affected both new and ongoing projects, said Mr Lee. While the amended Act allows contractors to seek monetary relief from their project partners for the Covid-19-induced spike in foreign worker wages that have not been priced into ongoing construction projects, it can only be invoked after a negotiation has been attempted. Mr Lee encouraged all affected parties to \"negotiate with each others in good faith\", before triggering the process, where an assessor will determine the loss suffered and decide on an adjusted sum. Responding to Leader of the Opposition Pritam Singh (Aljunied GRC), who asked if BTO prices will be affected, Mr Lee said prices of BTO flats that have been sold will not change. He noted that BTO flats are not priced to recover construction or land cost. \"Certainly (flat construction) will cost more as a whole, but this is not a factor in determining the price we set for BTO flats,\" he said. Responding to Mr Louis Ng (Nee Soon GRC) and Mr Henry Kwek (Kebun Baru SMC), he said the Government is open to looking at allowing in construction workers from different source countries, such as Myanmar and Thailand, to alleviate the current manpower crunch. But he said the Covid-19 situation in these countries must also be taken into consideration, as well as the industry\\'s demand for workers from these countries, given language and other barriers. Mr Kwek also suggested extending the additional buyer\\'s stamp duty (ABSD) remission timeline to relieve pressure on developers, whichare now expected to pay more for ongoing projects. Mr Lee said an earlier 12-month extension of the project completion period and ABSD remission has been provided, although the Government will monitor the impact and take further steps as necessary. Mr Lee acknowledged that foreign workers levy rebates, cost-sharing and grants are \"stop-gap measures\" that are not sustainable in the long run, which shows the importance of pressing on with efforts to transform the sector. \"We need to work closely with the industry to transform the sector to become more productive to grow local jobs and to reduce the overall reliance on low-skilled foreign manpower for longer term resilience and sustainability,\" he said. But the amendment to the law is aimed at helping construction firms here deal with a severe manpower crunch and cost increases that are beyond what companies could have predicted. The updated law nudges project partners to have a dialogue on equitable cost-sharing, beyond which there is a framework that allows for adjudication, he said.

       " {'text': 'covid 19 breath test breathonix hsa trial land checkpoint 14874824 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: A locally developed COVID-19 breath test that can generate results within one minute has received provisional authorisation from Singapore’s Health Sciences Authority (HSA). The BreFence Go COVID-19 breath test system was developed by Breathonix, a spin-off company of the National University of Singapore (NUS), and is the first breath analysis system to secure such authorisation in Singapore. “Breathonix is now working with the Singapore Ministry of Health (MOH) to run a deployment trial of their technology at one of the land checkpoints where incoming travellers will undergo screening with the BreFence Go COVID-19 breath test system,” NUS and Breathonix said in a media release on Monday (May 24). “This breath analysis will be carried out alongside the current compulsory COVID-19 antigen rapid test (ART).” The breath test system underwent clinical trials at three locations between June 2020 and April this year. The trials were conducted in Singapore at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) and Changi Airport, as well as in Dubai, in collaboration with the Dubai Health Authority and the Mohammed Bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences. The BreFence Go COVID-19 breath test system works by detecting volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in a person’s exhaled breath that are produced by biochemical reactions in human cells. VOC signatures in the breath of healthy people vary from that of people with illnesses, meaning that changes in VOCs can be measured as markers for diseases like COVID-19, NUS and Breathonix said. The system was developed from Breathonix’s cancer detection technology. “The breath test is simple to administer by trained personnel but does not require medically trained staff or laboratory processing,” NUS and Breathonix said. “A person only needs to blow into a disposable one-way valve mouthpiece connected to a high-precision breath sampler. “The exhaled breath is collected and fed into a cutting-edge mass spectrometer for measurement. “A proprietary software algorithm analyses the VOCs biomarkersand generates results in less than a minute.” Individuals screened as positive by the breath test will have to undergo a confirmatory polymerase chain reaction (PCR) COVID-19 swab test. Breathonix was founded by three NUS graduates, Dr Jia Zhunan, Mr Du Fang and Mr Wayne Wee Shi Jie, together with Dr Jia’s PhD adviser Professor T Venky Venkatesan. It is supported by the university’s Graduate Research Innovation Programme (GRIP), which “encourages talented NUS graduate students and research staff to establish and run high potential start-ups based on deep technologies”. “Our breath test is non-invasive,” said Dr Jia who is the CEO of Breathonix. “Users only need to breathe out normally into the disposable mouthpiece provided, so there will not be any discomfort. “Cross-contamination is unlikely as the disposable mouthpiece has a one-way valve and a saliva trap to prevent inhalation or saliva from entering the machine.” NUS deputy president of innovation and enterprise Professor Freddy Boey said that testing is key to the global recovery from COVID-19 pandemic. “The pandemic is likely to go on for several years. Mass, repeated testing has to be widely adopted as a key public health strategy to support the safe reopening of economies, and Breathonix’s home-grown technology hits the right spot,” said Prof Boey, who also leads the GRIP team. “I’m confident that their novel technology will make a significant contribution towards protecting the safety and health of Singaporeans and the global community.” NUS and Breathonix said that “there is strong commercial interest in the BreFence Go COVID-19 breath test system”, with the company in discussion with a number of local and overseas organisations to use the system.

The CAGannounced on Monday that workers will be segregatedbased on their COVID-19 exposure risk and that only those who have been vaccinated will work in high-risk zones.This, among other measures, will be rolled out by Jun 14 when the airport reopens to the public. Zone 1 –the highest-risk zone– will includethe terminal piers, the arrival immigration halls and baggage claim halls. Of the workers who tested positive for COVID-19, 23 of them were working in the highest-risk areas that will be classified as Zone 1, said CAG officials in a briefing on Monday. These areas werethe \"primary zone where the infection happened\", a CAG spokesperson added. At least 14of the infected workers who worked in these areashad visited the food court at Terminal 3 for meals, according to investigations. Theyvisited the food court at the \"critical window\" where community spread happened, said the CAG during the briefing. “It is now quite clear that although there is a lot of attention on this food court, the food court is not the issue. It is a secondary source of infection,\" added the spokesperson. Several days after they tested positive, a Victoria Junior College student and a landscaper with the National Parks Board were linked to the Changi Airport cluster, after it was found that they had visited the food court on the same dayas other confirmed cases. The food court was frequented on May 3 by two other cases in the Changi Airport cluster - a safety coordinator who workedat Terminal 3 and an aviation officer who workedat Terminals 1 and 3. The food court, which was previously open to the public, will fallunder Zone 3 inthe new segregation system. Changi Airport is an active COVID-19 cluster, with 108 cases as of Sunday. TRANSMISSION BETWEEN ZONES Other zones were “relatively clean”, said the CAG.Investigations found that there were cases from a “very specific cluster” at the extreme left wing of a transit area, which will bepart of Zone 2. There was mingling of staff members between Zone 1 and Zone 2, said CAG in the briefing. “So we believe that this cluster was a secondary source of infection that came from Zone 1. And we know because the numbers are much smaller, and if this zone was inherently \\'dirty\\', we would expect more cases and they would be dispersed in many areas,\" said the spokesperson. A worker who assisted a family from South Asia last month could have been the infection source that led to some staff members testing positive, the CAG andCivil Aviation Authority (CAAS) said on Friday. Similar to the spread of COVID-19in the Zone 2 area, if Zone 3 had “more inherent problems”, there would have been “far more” positive cases linked to it, said the CAG. “But this was not the case,” said a spokespersonin the briefing. The airport has implemented “many layers of stringent safety protocols” since March last year, and these measures have “served us well” for the past 15 months, said CAG CEO Lee Seow Hiang. “But clearly, something new has emerged with this variant, and the risk profile fundamentally shifted for our passenger operations. It has penetrated our defences and caused a community outbreak.” Downloadourappor subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

The new storage condition will greatly facilitate the transportation and local distribution of the vaccine to vaccination centres, as well as their storage and use at the centres, HSA said in a press release on Tuesday (May 25). This is important in ensuring the \"steady progress\" of the country\\'s vaccination programme, it said. The new storage condition was approved on May 20, following athorough review of the application and supplemental data submitted by Pfizer, the agency said. It comes after the United States\\' Food and Drug Administration on May 19 authorised storage of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine at refrigerator temperatures for up to a month. \"HSA has determined that the thawed, undiluted COVID‐19 vaccine remains stable when stored at standard refrigerator temperatures (2 to 8 degrees Celsius) for 31 days,\" said the authority. The long-term storage temperature for the vaccine remains at minus 70 degrees Celsius, it added. In HSA\\'s initial authorisation of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in December last year, it approved temporary storage of the vaccine after thawing at 2 to 8 degrees Celsius for up to five days. In February, HSA authorised a change indicating that the vaccine canbe stored at standard freezer temperature, or minus 20 degrees Celsius, for up to two weeks. The newly extended storage condition at refrigerator temperature is a \"significant improvement\" over existing storage conditions, said HSA CEO Mimi Choong. \"HSA\\'s evaluators will continue to conduct rigorous and efficient assessments of evolving scientific and real-world data, to facilitate Singapore\\'s continued access to critical COVID-19 vaccines and medicines and support our nation\\'s battle against the COVID-19 pandemic,\" said Dr Choong. Singapore has approved two COVID-19 vaccines for use, made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna.Both vaccines require two doses. Last week, the Ministry of Health announced that Singapore will extend the interval between the first and second vaccine doses to between six and eight weeks, up from three to four weeks. The shift in vaccination strategy is toprioritise more people getting their first dose of the vaccine. With this new strategy, Singapore aims to have about4.7 million people, or about 82 per cent of its population, receiving at least their first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine by August, said Health Minister Ong Ye Kung. As of May 9, about 1.8 million people in Singapore have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, with 1.2 million of them having completed the full vaccination regimen.

       " {'text': 'shangri la dialogue singapore cancelled uncertain covid 19 14848814 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: The Shangri-La Dialogue, which had been scheduled to take place on Jun 4 and Jun 5 in Singapore, has been cancelled two weeks before the meeting. This is due to the deterioration of the global COVID-19 situation, the organiser of the defence summit said in a statement on Thursday (May 20). It is with regret and sadness that the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) must announce the cancellation of the 2021Shangri-La Dialogue, it said. \"A wide range of defence ministers, senior officials, corporate leaders and influential strategists from Asia, North America, the Middle East and Europe have confirmed their attendance. \"The IISS has worked hard with the Government of Singapore, and in particular acted in close consultation with Singapore’s Ministry of Defence, to ensure a successful Dialogue this year, despite the challenges of the pandemic,\" said IISS. IISS had said on Monday that the Shangri-La Dialogue“remains on track”, despite the cancellation of theWorld Economic Forum\\'s Special Annual Meeting in Singapore about three months before it was scheduled to take place in August. Even during COVID-19,IISS on Thursday said it believes in the role of \"face-to-face diplomacy\" to solve global problems. \"We continue to hold successful face-to-face events, including the IISS Manama Dialogue in Bahrain, which was convened in 2020, and will take place again on Nov 19 to Nov 21, 2021.\" The global COVID-19 situation has recently deteriorated, in part because of the rise of infectious new variants, said IISS. Singapore, which has seen a recent rise in COVID-19 cases in the community, has also recently introduced new restrictions, it noted. \"The prospect of further tightening cannot be ruled out, all of which creates uncertainty,\" said IISS. Taken together, those various factors mean that holding an in-person Shangri-La Dialogue this year is \"unviable\", it added. The IISS said it remains committed tothe Shangri-La Dialogue, which it had convened every year since 2002, until the pandemic halted its efforts. The Institute added that itsIISS–Asia office in Singapore will continuewith a programme of research and events, while also beginning to plan the next IISS Fullerton Forum in January 2022, and the return of the full in-person IISS Shangri-La Dialogue in the middle of next year. The Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) said in a statement following the announcement that it supports IISS\\' decision to call off the summit. \"Although regretful, it is the responsible course, with the health and safety of the local community and participants as the foremost consideration,\" said MINDEF. Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen on Thursday said that when invitations for the Shangri-La Dialogue were issued earlier this year, IISS and MINDEFwere “quietly optimistic” that the control measures and mass vaccinations under way in many countries would allow for a physical meeting to be held in Singapore in June. “Security challenges continue to confront us despite the pandemic and the face-to-face meetings were necessary for frank and deep conversations between Defence Ministers and other participants. Important initiatives and policies have resulted from past Shangri-La Dialogues that today contribute to peace and stability in our region and beyond,” he said in a Facebook post. “We were heartened by the positive responses to our invitations, especially from (Japan Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga) and many defence ministers. Their commitment to be here in Singapore physically reflected the strong desire to have meaningful dialogue to deal with pressing transnational security issues that confront us all. I am thankful to all of them for their strong show of support.” Unfortunately, Dr Ng said the COVID-19 pandemic “has not abated and indeed taken a turn for the worse”, especially in parts of Asia, aggravated by more infectious variants. “The next few weeks will remain challenging and uncertain. It is therefore unfortunate that Shangri-La Dialogue2021 will be cancelled. This decision was taken in close consultation with the Singapore Government. Although regretful, it is the responsible course, with the health and safety of the local community and participants as the foremost consideration,” he wrote. Dr Ng said the cancellation of the Shangri-La Dialogue in no way reflects any reduced commitment to dialogue and engagement to promote peace and stability in Asia and beyond. “Rather, it is yet another example of how COVID-19 has disrupted normalcy, in all facets of our lives and social discourse. We will find alternate and safer avenues for these important goals.” Downloadourappor subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

SINGAPORE: Mandatory COVID-19 testing began on Friday (May 21) for all residents of Block506 Hougang Ave 8, after the Ministry of Health (MOH) said late on Thursday night that“a few” positive cases live there. MOH did not say how many cases tested positive, but noted that themove to test all residents is a\"precautionary measure\". The swabbing exercise began at 1pm on Fridayat the void deck of the block, and it will take place over two days. \"We have distributed leaflets to affected residentsand will also send them an SMS notification. Residents of 506 Hougang Avenue 8 are also advised to monitor their health closely and consult a doctor immediately if they feel unwell,\" said the ministry. \"NOT A LARGE OUTBREAK\": GERALD GIAM On Friday, Member of ParliamentGerald Giam (WP-Aljunied) was at the block, which is in his ward. Speaking to reporters, he emphasised that the swabbing is a precautionary measure. While he said he could not reveal the number of cases, he said it was\"not a large outbreak that’s happened here\". \"It\\'s a small number of cases, so there’s no need for the residents to be overly alarmed. But it’s important for all the residents to be swabbed because MOH wants to make sure that the cases are contained,\" he said. \"I hope the residents would take this calmly and comply with the instructions that they would have received from the MOH via SMS.\" Given thatthe block is \"relatively large\", housing \"about 116\" four-room flats, Mr Giam said that the residents will be swabbed according to the levels they live on to \"space out\" the testing. The Health Promotion Board is facilitating operations thatwill take place from 1pm to 8pm on Friday and 9am to 4pm on Saturday, he added, urging residents to stay home after the swab test. He also gave assurances that the block hadbeen \"thoroughly disinfected\". \"We did a wipe down of the entire block including all the high-touch surfaces on the ground floor,\" he said, adding that another round of cleaning will be done. Mr Giam was accompanied by fellow Aljunied MP Pritam Singh, who was seen speaking to residents. Mr Singh, who is also the Workers\\' Party secretary-general, wrote about the swabbing operation on his Facebook page. Residents from the lower floors will be tested on Fridaywhile those on the upper levels will be tested on Saturday, he said. A \"key concern\" is that residents may go to the void deck once the swabbing starts, crowding the area, he said. Mr Singh urged residents to stick to their assignedtimings \"so that the safe distancing ambassadors deployed at the block do not have a difficult time\". \"Residents of block 506, please do not hesitate to get in touch with the HPB team (excellent officers on the ground) or MP Gerald Giam if you have any queries/concerns,\" he wrote. TESTING AT TAMPINES BLOCK IN JUNE 2020 Testing of residents in an HDB block was similarly carried out in June last year, when contact tracers noticed that members in two households in the same block in Tampines tested positive for COVID-19 and flagged this for closer monitoring. Six residents in one household and two residents in another household had tested positive. As a precautionary measure, 58 households living in the same section of Block 111 Tampines Street 11 that are served by a common lift lobby and stairwell were \"proactively identified\". MOH placed the households under phone surveillance and facilitated voluntary COVID-19 testing for them and their visitors. In an update on Jul 17, the ministry said that 152 residents and 25 visitors were contacted in relation to the Tampines block. Of them, 123 people took up the offer for testing and all of them tested negative, the ministry said. Additional reporting by Kurt Ganapathy.

A spokesperson for Facebooksaid the company had received \"a direction from the Singapore Government in relation to a claim they determined contains false information\". \"We\\'ve carefully reviewed the direction and are legally compelled to issue a correction notice from the Singapore Government to all people using Facebook in Singapore,\" said the spokesperson. Facebook issued a temporary prompt on its news feed for users in Singapore on Thursday. Twitter said a specialist global team, which looks into requests from governments and law enforcement agencies, reviewed the \"request\" from the Singapore Government and found it to be applicable under Singapore law. \"In-line with our values around openness, transparency and trust, this request will be reflected in Singapore’s section of the Twitter Transparency Report, which we publish twice-yearly,\" a Twitter spokesperson told CNA. NO SINGAPORE VARIANT: MOH \"There is no new \\'Singapore\\'variant of COVID-19. Neither is there evidence of any COVID-19 variant that is ‘extremely dangerous for kids’,\"said MOH. The strain that is prevalent in many COVID-19 cases in Singapore in recent weeks is the B16172 variant, which originated in India, added the Health Ministry. \"The existence and spread of the B16172 variant within India predates the detection of the variant in Singapore, and this has been publicly known and reported by various media sources from as early as May 5, 2021,\"said MOH. The ministryadvised members of the public not to speculate or spread unfounded rumours. Late Tuesday night, MOHsaid that there is “no truth whatsoever” in the assertion in several news reports in India that there is a Singapore variant of the COVID-19 virus. The claims were reported in articles published by the Hindustan Times and NDTV, both from India. The articles quoted tweets from Delhi’s chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, who was cited as saying that the new strain is “extremely dangerous for children” and could result in a third wave of infections in India. Singapore\\'s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has expressed its concerns to India\\'s High Commissioner over comments made by the Delhi chief minister. Posting on Twitter on Wednesday, India\\'s External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said Mr Kejriwal\\'s comments were \"irresponsible\" and that the Delhi chief minister \"does not speak for India\". \"Singapore and India have been solid partners in the fight against COVID-19,\" Mr S Jaishankar added.

Most of these cases \"peaked around May 13\",said CAAS and CAG in their release, and noneare in serious condition or require treatment inthe intensive care unit. Ten were tested during a special testing operation while 33 were detected while serving quarantine orders, through earlier rostered routine testing, through the Ministry of Health’s (MOH) voluntary testing operation for visitors to Terminal 3, or upon seeking medical treatment from a general practitioner. Further investigations by MOH and CAAS are ongoing. A total of 100 COVID-19 cases have been linked to Changi Airport as of Thursday, making it the country’s largest active cluster. Authorities said last week that a number of those cases were congregated around a zone that receives travellers from higher-risk regions, including South Asia. CAAS and CAG added that close to 19,000 frontline and office workers in the Changi Airport Passenger Terminal Buildings and Jewel Changi Airport were tested from May 9 to May 20 during its special testing operations. All workers at Terminal 1 and Jewel tested negative for COVID-19 while 10 workers from Terminal 3 tested positive.“Out of an abundance of caution, all airport workers who were working around T3 Basement 2 who had tested negative for COVID-19 in their first test, have been rostered to take an additional COVID-19 test since May 20, 2021 – these results are pending,” they said. CAAS and CAG also announced on Friday that Changi Airport\\'s passenger terminals as well as Jewel will remain closed to the public until the end of the Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) period, while all arrivals from \"very high-risk\" countries and regions will undergo additional COVID-19 testing. According to CNA\\'s study of data published on MOH’s website, 43 out of the 100 cases linked to the cluster so far have received one or two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine. A comparison between those who have been vaccinated and those who have not, revealed that there were 12 more symptomatic cases in the unvaccinated pool. Common symptoms include fever, cough and runny nose. Twenty-four patients linked to the cluster preliminarily tested positive for the B1617 variant, which was first detected in India. Half of them were not vaccinated. Downloadourappor subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

Cheang Eng Hock, 56, received two charges of intentionally causing harassment.His wife Lim Sok Lay, 48, was given fivesimilar charges and one count of public nuisance. They are accused ofusing insulting words and behaviour against theirneighbours at a Punggol HDB block in May 2020 by shouting: \"COVID\", \"COVID spreader\", \"virus\" or \"virus family\". They also allegedly sprayed disinfectant solution in their neighbours\\' direction. They arealso accused of using insulting words against a man at Sengkang General Hospital by uttering: \"This nurse gangster\", \"this nurse no good\" and \"this nurse very bad\" on Jan 8, 2021. Lim is also accused ofcursing at her neighbours in November and spraying disinfectant at her neighbours in October and December last year. The judge ordered Lim to be remanded at the Institute of Mental Health for two weeks for psychiatric assessment at the prosecution\\'s request. He offeredCheang bail of S$5,000 with the conditionthat he must not contact his neighbours directly or indirectly, nor any of the prosecution\\'s witnesses. Their neighbours, the nurse and his wife, had reported harassment to the police in May last year. They filed more police reports about the alleged harassment between October 2020 and January 2021, even though both sets of neighbours had attended mediation in June 2020. Sengkang General Hospital said in a Facebook post in May last year that the nurse had lodged a police report, noting a video postedabout theneighbour\\'s behaviour. The hospital said its medical workers deserve consideration, respect, and a safe environment both at work and at home and called on the public to respect such workers. The police said in an earlier media release that they had remained in contact with all involved parties and advised them to minimise contact and interactions with each other. If convicted of intentionally causing harassment, Cheang and Limcould each be jailed up to six months, fined up to S$5,000, or both per charge.

       " {'text': 'in focus singapore covid 19 targeted measures phase 2 14809052 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: It had been a tough year for Singapore. Then, as 2020 came to its close, it looked like the country could see a flicker oflight at the end of the long COVID-19 tunnel with its transition on Dec 28 to Phase 3 of its reopening. And in the months that followed, the path to a post-pandemicnormality looked to be fairly smooth, withcommunity cases generally running to no more than a few a day. Plans for events which hadn\\'t been possible for months started to gather pace. This was in spite of the pandemic continuing to rage worldwide, with a number of countries forced to introduce and then reintroduce measures to curb the spread of the raging virus. Singapore hadn\\'t needed to. Then, very quickly,things changed. Clusters began to spring up, with one emerging at Tan Tock Seng Hospital - the first in a local hospital since the pandemic began. Community cases began to steadily increase. To tackle the spike, Singapore announced some tighter, targeted measures on May 4. Places that were considered high-risk, such as indoor gyms and fitness studios, were instructed to close unless they offered low-intensity activities, while fewer people would be allowed at attractions, public libraries, funerals and MICE events. Limits for gatherings reverted to five people. But as community cases showed no signs of letting up, measures were further tightened on Friday (May 14) under what the Health Ministry called \"Phase 2 (Heightened Alert)\". Among other initiatives, sizes of group gatherings were further reduced from five to two people, with dining-in at F&B establishments banned. Working from home is also to be the default at workplaces. The new measures will take effect from May 16 through June 13. Speaking at a multi-ministry task force press conference on Friday, Education Minister Lawrence Wong noted in particular that “risk settings” for the spread of the virus were indoor environments where people do not put a mask on. This is why the Government had focused on tightening restrictions in such areas, he noted. “We have already done so earlier for activities in the gyms and fitness centers where you are unable to keep your mask on,” Mr Wong explained. “And now the next step ...is to restrict such activities in F&B establishments, and therefore no more dining in. In other settings -outdoorsor when you are in a space but you are able to keep your mask on - we believewith safe distancing, with proper precautions, and safeguards, these activities can still continue.” Health Minister Gan Kim Yong also added that such moves would be part of Singapore’s “journey to recovery”. “This is part of a journey to recovery, because every now and then, when there\\'s (an) outbreak, we have to review our measures, and we need to tighten as we go along. And when infections come under control, then we’ll have (the) opportunity to roll back some of these measures, open up the economy, open up the community, so that people can begin to also socialise and interact with one another.” BREAKING THE CHAINS OF TRANSMISSION As the COVID-19 situation continues to evolve globally, infectious disease experts say that targeted sectoral measures, such as the ones introduced by Singapore, are set to be the way forward. “Sectoral lockdowns in a targeted fashion (are) likely the way to go, but the thing is that the decision to do that must be quick and fast,” said Dr Ling Li Min, who is an infectious disease specialist at Rophi Clinic. Dr Ling noted that such an approach requires that community cases are not widespread. “When countries embark on these targeted measures, it is probably at a point in time whereby they feel that they can still control it, meaning that community cases are not widespread, it\\'s only small clusters here and there,” she explained. “Early on, you can\\'t keep waiting for the cases to increase, and that can only happen when the community cases overall are still low. If there are a lot of community cases, then your sectoral lockdown isn’t going to work.” For such measures to bear fruit, the rest of the community must be “clued in”, said Dr Ling. “The testing, the tracing, (the) isolation must be superb and robust. Some of these countries don\\'t quite have that - they\\'re not as swiftwith that,” she noted. Dr Paul Tambyah, infectious diseases expert and president of the Asia Pacific Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infection, noted that these sectoral measures are likely to remain in place until vaccination rates reach higher levels. “I think that these measures are temporary until the vaccination rates reach levels that have been achieved in countries such as Israel where the measures are being lifted gradually,” he said. “Similar opening up is occurring in other highly vaccinated places such as the UK and US and UAE. If the WTO (World Trade Organisation) waiver on vaccine patents is granted, then this is likely to happen sooner rather than later all over the world.” As Singapore is one of the world’s most globally connected cities, it is likely to need “far higher” levels of vaccination to protect the population than other more \"closed or isolated\" societies such as Israel or New Zealand, added Dr Tambyah. As of May 9, about 1.8 million people hadreceived at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, with 1.2 million of them receiving their second dose, Mr Gan had said in Parliament on Tuesday (May 11). Data compiled by the Our World in Data project at the University of Oxford, shows that close to 60 percent of Israel’s population has received at least one dose of the vaccine. The number currently stands at about 30 per cent for Singapore. FINDING ‘MIDDLE GROUND’ One of the reasons why total lockdowns have been implemented in some countries is due to the fact that hospitals are facing thepossibility of being inundated, said Dr Teo Yik Ying, who is dean of the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health. “A total lockdown is necessary when the health system is at risk of being overwhelmed. That is when you realize that the situation is getting rapidly out of control. And the definition of out of control here is that the infection is spreading so fast in the community, and resulting in a large number of people entering the hospitals,” said Dr Teo. A total lockdown would serve two main purposes, he noted. The first of which would be to stop interactionso as to cut chains of transmission in the community. And when such chains are cut, this minimises the infections only to households, he added. “What that means is that with time, you actually allow the number of patients in the hospitals to slowly go down ...Your hospitals now have a chance to breathe,” he said. “That is actually very important because once your hospital is overwhelmed, you realise that anyone seeking care at the hospital, whether it is COVID, or non COVID related, they will be compromised because nurses are overwhelmed, doctors are overwhelmed.” And while Singapore had been forced into a circuit-breaker period - similar to a lockdown - last year, there has not been a need to re-impose that because the healthcare system is not at the risk of being overwhelmed, said Dr Teo. For one, in addition to current bed capacity, there was also the setting up of community facilities around the island last year to bolster capacity, he pointed out. “After our initial fear that we saw in April (and)May last year, there is now built in place some additional surge capacity. It is not massive, it is never massive, but at least hospitals now have a better way of coordinating their resources to cope with rising numbers,” he added. Speaking to CNA, Dr Dale Fisher, who is senior consultant at the National University Hospital’s division of infectious disease, noted that many countries have tried to find a compromise as part of their strategy to tackle COVID-19. “Many countries have tried to find this middle ground - particularly Singapore obviously - of targeting specific things for specific reasons.So I don\\'t think it\\'s new,” he said. “Now if you\\'ve got good contact tracing, good case isolation, good quarantining, good social distancing, good community buy in, capacity to scale up testing - if all these are in place, then really countries should be less inclined to do the blunt lockdowns.” He noted that aside from countries with a strategy of completeelimination of the virus such as Australia, such a lockdown should not be the first option. “It should have been a place of last resort, when you really had lost control of the situation. Your contact tracing couldn\\'t keep up, your quarantining wasn\\'t effective, or your case isolation was not in place - many countries didn\\'t isolate their cases,” he added. Dr Tambyah noted that such a total lockdown would be “very drastic” and have “numerous adverse consequences”. These include risks of death from falls in older people living alone, mental health problems in individuals who are isolated, as well as increases in domestic violence, among other things, he said. Going back to such lockdowns would be a very “retrograde step”, added Dr Fisher. “I think that would be a very retrograde step because we want to be pushing forward in opening up to achieve this balance of living with the virus and we don\\'t want to have to be locking down regularly,” said Dr Fisher. “I think what Singapore is doing is the right way, which is try and nuance your way through it, bring that number back down.” WIDENING ‘INEQUITIES’ Dr Teo that “personal safe management measures” such as mask wearing and social distancing remain important. “Once we started imposing face mask wearing, we never changed our stance on that, we never changed our stance on social distance, and neither our stance on group size restrictions. We have always maintained that there is a need to restrict group sizes, because whether it is for dining, coming together for things, those are the activities that have the highest risk of spreading (the virus),” he added. And Dr Teo noted that acceptance of these measures remain high despite the fact that Singapore has been in this pandemic for over a year. However, there remain disadvantages associated with such a targeted approach, he said. “Sectoral lockdowns actually widen inequities. Effectively, you are saying that certain sectors of the economy have to be shut down in order to allow other sectors of the economy to progress,” Dr Teo added. As such, policies need to be put into place to ensure that these sectors are being looked after, amid the closures, he added. On Friday, it was announced that F&B businesses, which are going to have to deal with the suspension of dine-in business, will get additional financial support. Regardless of whether a total lockdown or targeted sectoral measures are put into place, Dr Ling noted that there is a risk of fatigue among the public. “At this point in time, everyone knows that if we don\\'t do something about it, it\\'s just only going to get worse. And then it ends up being (a) total lockdown for everyone, which is even a lot worse. (It is akin to) choosing between the devil and deep blue sea, it\\'s likethere’s no good choice,” she said. Given that safe management measures are not compulsory in some other countries, this could potentially exacerbate fatigue, she noted. “In certain countries, it is very difficult to implement safe management measures and implement masking, to make it compulsory. And so when there are a lot of interactions, and when there is slight breakdown in any of these measures, the cases will balloon,\" she said. While other countries aim for a strategy which involves a total elimination of the virus, Singapore is trying to find a compromisebetween allowing economic activity, and somesocial activities to resume while trying to keep the public health situation under control,noted Dr Teo. “It means that we will start to look at some of this dialing up and dialing down of our measures between phase three, phase two, phase three, phase two, even maybe going backto phase one from time to time. This will be something we have to be mentally prepared for,” he said. At the same time, Dr Ling emphasised the need for Singaporeans to be constantly on their toes. “The community has to be mentally prepared that COVID is going to be here to stay for an indefinite period of time,” she said. “We being part of this community and being part of a global society, we just have to make sure that we try to keep it at bay for as long as we can. And we\\'re going to have to do whatever we can to do that.” It looks like the email address you entered is not valid. Copyright© Mediacorp 2021. Mediacorp Pte Ltd.

       " {'text': 'covid 19 staycation booking cancellation postponed new rule 14841702 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: Booking cancellations have gone up at some hotels, following the announcement last week that each room may only accommodate up to two guests amid a rise in COVID-19 cases. Most of thehotels CNA spoke to also said they have received many queries from guests who had booked rooms for the one-month Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) period. “Understandably, in response to the new measures by the Government, most hotels at large would have seen cancellations or modifications in staycation reservations - specifically if the bookings include more than two people from different households,” said a spokesman for Marriott International. “This trend was also observed across the Marriott Bonvoy portfolio of hotels in Singapore, though it has not been a very significant impact over the last few days.” There are 11 hotels under Marriott Bonvoy, including the Singapore Marriott Tang Plaza Hotel,The St Regis Singapore, The Westin and W Singapore Sentosa Cove. The requests for booking changes have been varied, said the spokesman. For example, The Westin saw “a rather balanced split” between guests opting to postpone and those opting to go ahead with their staycations. At W Singapore Sentosa Cove, those who have opted to go ahead “form the minority”, said the spokesman. “Based on what we have been seeing since the heightened measures were announced, we expect cancellations and postponements of stays to continue if community cases continue to increase.” On May 14, the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) said in an advisory that hotels should not allow more than two individuals, guests and visitors, in each room per dayexcept for where individuals are from the same household. This means that families with more than two people who live together can go ahead with their staycation plans. STB later clarified in response to questions from Today that families should split into groups of two people when outside the room. This aligns with the Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) measures that took effect onMay 16, with the permitted gathering size down from five to two. The new measures are “disappointing”, but “not unexpected”, said a Millennium Hotels and Resorts spokesman. The group operates Orchard Hotel, M Social Singapore, Grand Copthorne Waterfront, Copthorne King’s Hotel, M Hotel and Studio M. “For staycations, most couples are going ahead with their bookings while family bookings have mostly been postponed to later in the year,” said the spokesman. “Those whose bookings are in mid-June are adopting a wait-and-see attitude and will decide nearer the date on their plans. For this period, we will focus on couple staycations and continue to seek out long-stay corporate business.” Yotel Singapore at Orchard Road saw an “expected increase” in cancellations, said general manager Brendan Daly. “However, it’s not the overnight sharp spike that was expected,” he added. “Our product suits couples and families rather than large groups so this may have something to do with it.” The hotel has also received some new bookings, but there’s been a larger decrease in new bookings compared to cancellations, said Mr Daly, noting that guests are probably waiting for restrictions to ease before booking a staycation. Of the customers who were booked for staycations between May 16 and Jun 13 who contacted the hotel, there was “a 50/50 split” between cancellation and date amendment, he added. “If you balance cancellations or amendments and what we would typically pick up in new bookings, then overall guests going ahead would be in the minority.” The hotel also expects fewer people to make staycation plans if more COVID-19 cases in the community emerge. “With the F&B restrictions of no dine-in allowed, there’s less reasons to visit the Orchard Road area where we are located,” said Mr Daly. Far East Hospitality’s hotels have seen an increase in amendments to their bookings, said its CEO Arthur Kiong. It runs the Village, Quincy, Oasia and Rendezvous brands of hotels. The hotels are “not seeing the usual interest levels” for new staycation bookings, but there is “still demand” over this period, he added. There has also been an increase in inquiries from families looking to book a staycation, said Mr Kiong. The group’s hotels have adapted to the new measures by rolling out new packages with in-room dining experiences among other add-ons, he added. “This may be attributed to the upcoming June holidays and the yearning to break from the work-from-home and home-based learning routine to enjoy a getaway. “Since overseas travel is still not possible right now, going on a staycation is the best option to allow them to catch a breather and spend quality time as family.” Boutique hotels CNA spoke to saw minimal cancellations, with more guests opting to move the dates of their stay or go ahead with their stay instead. Hotel manager of boutique hotel Lloyd’s Inn Kelvin Soh told CNA that cancellations and amendments formed “only a small fraction” of the staycations booked for the one-month period. About 88 per cent of guests who had booked rooms for this one-month period opted to go ahead while observing the two-person rule, said Mr Soh. “We expect cancellations to continue if the community cases continue to rise - this is normal as people take precautions,” he added. “However, at the same time, with the measures limited to same household family members (and) two people (couples) allowed to staycation, we are still likely to see staycation bookings coming in.” Luxury boutique hotel Naumi Singapore “did observe anxiety” when the tightened measures were announced on May 14, said general manager Viri Kaur, adding that the hotel received “numerous calls” about what facilities would be available throughout this period. “The demographics of our hotel are primarily profiles of couples wanting a romantic getaway and creatives or friends who usually book a room for two guests. As such we are comfortable in complying with the two guests per room requirement and are confident with a pent up demand for staycations especially with the extension of SRV (SingapoRediscover) vouchers,” she added. Two per cent of bookings were cancelled on the first two days following the announcement as guests were unsure if staycations were still allowed, said Ms Kaur. “As more information and clarification was provided, we are now seeing a positive trend for bookings for this month onwards. These cancellations have now preferred to defer their staycation plans and we look forward to welcoming them soon,” she added. Two per cent of guests who had booked staycations with the hotel in May moved their reservations to after mid-June, said Ms Kaur, adding that the hotel is “exercising flexibility” for date change or cancellation requests. “We expect to see an increase in change of dates but not high trends of cancellations as our local community is still interested in activities locally and seem to trend towards boutique hotels for less crowds.” It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

       " {'text': 'covid 19 border restrictions migrant workers manpower crunch 14831646 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: Singapore has not been able to \"adequately replace\" migrant workerswho have left the country over the last year, given the presence of COVID-19 border restrictions, said the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) on Tuesday (May 18). In a statement to the media, the ministry said there have been recent calls by members of the public to close Singapore\\'s borders \"entirely\" to bring down the number of imported infections. \"At the same time, businesses have been appealing for more workers to be allowed to enter Singapore to address manpower shortages,\" the statement added. According to MOM, the outflow of migrant workers over the last year has exceeded the inflow, as workers ended their contracts and chose to return home. \"As a result of border restrictions to mitigate importation risks, we have not been able to adequately replace those who have left Singapore,\" said the ministry. IMPACT OF NOT ALLOWING ANY MIGRANTS IN WOULD HAVE BEEN \"SEVERE\" MOM said the impact of not allowing any migrant workers to enter Singapore after the COVID-19 \"circuit breaker\" last year would have been \"severe\" for businesses and families. Had this happened, the ministry said there would now be:- 70,000 fewer migrant workers working in the services sector, including essential services such as healthcare and cleaning- 30,000 fewer construction workers working on key infrastructure and building projects- 30,000 fewer migrant domestic workers In response to CNA\\'s queries, MOM clarified that these figures include work permit and S Pass holders in the construction and services sectors, as well as foreign domestic workers on work permits. The ministry also referred to data available on its website, stating the total number of foreign workers in Singapore. As of December 2020, there were 1.23 million migrant workers in the country, down from 1.43 million a year before. The latest figure includes 177,100 employment pass holders, 174,000 S Pass holders, 247,400 foreign domestic workers, as well as 311,000 work permit holders in the construction, marine shipyard and process sectors. MOM also said in its statement: \"Border restrictions will impact Singaporeans’ daily lives and this will be felt more keenly in the coming weeks and months.\" Since May 2, long-term pass holders and short-term visitors with travel history to Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka in the last 14 days have been barred from entry or transit in Singapore. A similar ban has applied to India since Apr 24. The decision was taken after a deterioration in the COVID-19 situation in India, with the infection spreading to the surrounding countries, co-chair of the COVID-19 task force Lawrence Wong said, announcing the move. FIRMS TRYING TO RETAIN EXISTING WORKERS, BUT MANY ARE \"HOMESICK\" The Manpower Ministry on Tuesday said many businesses are trying to hold on to existing workers. \"We agree it makes sense to try to retain our existing workers. Indeed, many businesses are already doing so\", with firms offering workers higher retention bonuses and industry associations facilitating transfers of workers to new employers, said MOM. \"However, many migrant workers are understandably homesick, are worried about their families at home and wish to return home,\" it added. Since February this year, all newly arrived work permit and S Pass workers in construction, marine and process sectors from higher-risk countries and regions have been subject to an additional seven days of testing on top of a 14-day stay-home notice. Those headed to dormitories regardless of sector have also been placed under the additional testing regime since January. This means all such workers, upon arrival,will have to stay at a designated facility for 21 days. After the three-week period, they are immediately placed on the rostered routine testing regime alongside other workers. RESTRICTIONS ON INCOMING WORKERS LIKELY TO \"PERSIST FOR SOME TIME\" Singapore\\'s restrictions on the inflow of workers from higher-risk countries will \"likely persist for some time, until the situation improves. This is the only way we can ensure the safe inflow of workers, while managing the risk of transmission in the community,\" said MOM. \"We are mindful of the manpower crunch that our businesses will face, and the caregiving help that our families will need, as a result.\" Following the tightening of border restrictions on May 2, several firms told CNA that companies that have traditionally relied on migrant workers from India and Bangladesh were looking further afield for labour. But they added that they were just starting to explore the options and to expect project delays and disruptions for the time being. Stakeholders in Singapore’s construction industry on Monday also appealed to the COVID-19 multi-ministry task force to allow foreign workers to enter Singapore “in a safe and controlled manner”. The Construction Industry Joint Committee said that the current manpower situation may result in further delays to construction projects and could cause jobs to be lost in the industry. It has asked the Government “to adopt a balanced approach and work with industry to allow the recruitment and inflow of foreign manpower”. Mr Wong has also said that Build-to-Order (BTO) housing projects are expectedto be delayed by a year or more, as a result of tighter border measures affecting the construction sector.

Five people pleaded guilty to their respective offences of breaking COVID-19 regulations on Friday (May 21), with one woman fined S$2,000 for breaking social gathering limits. Probation suitability reports were called for the rest, who are aged 20 and below. In the first case, Clarie Koh Qian Ping, 21, was given the S$2,000 fine. She pleaded guilty to one charge of meeting with others for a social purpose without reasonable excuse. A second charge of leaving her home for a non-permitted activity was considered in sentencing. Two co-accused also pleaded guilty to similar charges: Darren Sam Yi Lo, 20, and a 17-year-old girl who cannot be named under the Children and Young Persons Act. Their co-accused Joel Ang Yun Nan, 25, had rented the unit at Midview City in Sin Ming Lane as a public entertainment outlet, playing music and selling liquor there. He decided to invite his friends to the unit for his birthday party on Jan 8, 2021, asking them to invite their friendsfor the party that would involve \"a lot of people\", the court heard. A total of 40 people, mostly in their 20s, left their homes and went to the unit, arriving from 10pm on Jan 8, 2021. An operations manager of KH Security Agency -the firm in charge of security atMidview City -was informed by histeam that people were seen entering and leaving the unit. He went down to check at around midnight and saw that the unit was locked. However, music was being played and people were waiting around the area.He called the police. Police arrived at the location later that morning and found 40 people inside, drinking liquor and chatting. The maximum allowed group size for social gatherings then was eight individuals. In the second case, also at the same location but involving a separate group of individuals, Ang decided tohost another party. This was despite him being arrested forthe first incident. A total of 13 people, mostly in their 20s, went to the Midview City unit on the night of Jan 16, 2021. The operations manager of the security firm called the police again about the place being used for \"illegal karaoke\". The police arrived at 3.35am and heard loud music coming from the unit. They entered and saw speakers and other sound transmission devices installed in the unit, with the 13 individuals drinking liquor and chatting inside. The maximum allowed group size for social gatherings then was eight people. Two of the partygoers in this second incident pleaded guilty on Friday: Jayden Ang Jin Jie, 20, and 19-year-old Faith Princess Lim Yu Qing. The prosecution called for a S$2,000 fine for all the accused in both cases, and did not object to the calling of probation suitability reports for those under 21.

Growth was slower than in March, when manufacturing output increased by 7.6 per cent. Excluding biomedical manufacturing, output grew by 11.1 per cent in April this year, in part due to \"circuit breaker\" measures in the same month last year,said the Economic Development Board (EDB). On Tuesday morning, the Ministry of Trade and Industry had announced it was maintaining Singapore\\'s gross domestic product forecast for the year at 4 to 6 per cent, in view of \"heightened uncertainties\" arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. PRECISION AND TRANSPORT ENGINEERING RISE Growth was headlined by precision engineering output, which expanded by 20.4 per cent year-on-year in April. This was led by themachinery and systems segment growing 27 per cent, supported by higher production of semiconductor equipment due to strong capital investment in the global semiconductor industry, said EDB. The precision modules and components segment also rose 10.5 per cent. The transport engineering cluster grew 19 per cent, with the land segment recording a 101.1 per cent surge. This was due to Singapore\\'s \"circuitbreaker\"measures and lockdowns in export markets whichadversely affected production last year, said EDB. The aerospace segment also rose23.8 per cent from a low base due to the grounding of aircraft amid COVID-19 travel restrictions. The marine and offshore engineering segment contracted 5.9 per cent on the back of weak demand and labour shortages, said the agency. Other clusters that expanded were general manufacturingby 18 per cent, chemicals by 14.4 per centand electronics by 6.6 per cent. BIOMEDICAL MANUFACTURING SLIDES FURTHER Output in the biomedical manufacturing segmentdeclined for a second consecutive month, falling 22.7 per cent in April. While the medical technology segment grew 12.7 per cent with higher export demand for medical devices, the pharmaceuticals segmentshrank by 24.7 per cent due to a different mix of active pharmaceutical ingredients, said EDB. On a seasonally adjusted month-on-month basis, overall manufacturing output increased1 per cent in April. Excluding biomedical manufacturing, output fell 0.6 per cent.

       " {'text': 'new hotels still opening singapore amid covid 19 tourism 14633372 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: After opening the doors to The Clan Hotel in the central business districtlast month, Far East Hospitality is already gearing up for another launch this year. The upcoming property will mark the Singaporecompany’s foray into the resort and spa category, and it is going ahead with plans despite the COVID-19 pandemic. “The Oasia Resort Sentosa is slated to open in the second half of 2021,” said chief executive Arthur Kiong. The Ascott, CapitaLand’s wholly-owned lodging business unit, also has new properties lined up this year. It is set to debut the 172-room Citadines Connect City Centre Singapore in Dhoby Ghaut this December, as well as a 240-unit property at Farrer Park in October under its co-living brand lyf. The development of another lyf property located at one-north is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter. These are not the only hotel and serviced residence operators that are braving the COVID-19 pandemic with new offerings. Last year, the Singapore market saw several new entrants such asParkroyal Collection Marina Bay, Dusit Thani Laguna Singapore, Duxton Reserve and Mint Hotel within One Farrer Hotel. Launches will continue next year and beyond, including new hotel brands such as the 204-room Edition by Marriott, the 350-room Pullman Singapore and the 303-room Mondrian Singapore, according to CBRE Hotels Asia-Pacific associate director Zhang Jiahao. These plans reflect continued confidence among hoteliers in the Singapore market, he said. “While there is now a standstill in global travel and tourism, we expect demand to return to normalcy in the mid-term and it is expected to be potentially stronger than pre-COVID days due to the pent-up demand, and strong support and efforts by the Singapore Government for the industry,\" he added. “Therefore, the proposed supply is believed to be adequate and necessary to cater to this expected increase in demand.” Mr Zhang noted that the new supply comprises a range of mid-scale to luxury hotels which will appeal to a variety of travellers. “BEST TIME” TO OPEN Although it might seem counterintuitive to start a business at a time when the travel industry is at a near standstill, Mr Govinda Singh, executive directorof valuation and consultancy services atColliers, told CNA that now “is the best time for hoteliers to open”. This is because new hotels take time to ramp up their operations. “For hotels, the pre-opening to soft-opening period takes about sixmonths where they solve out teething issues, and from there to the formal opening is about another threeto fourmonths,” Mr Singh explained. Corporate contracts and group bookings, which bring in the bulk of bookings for hotels, also take time to be negotiated and established, he added. “Hotels take time to ramp up operations. During market entry, business will be soft anyway so why not open when the market is weak? By the time markets start to recover, teething issues would be ironed out and you’ll be ready to welcome your guests.” Mr Kiong from Far East Hospitality said that while the pandemic has slowed business, it has provided the company with time to hone its product and service offerings, as well as a chance to try out new processes and technology. “Moving ahead with our plans during the pandemic has given the operations team more time – a luxury we cannot afford under normal operating conditions – to fine-tune all areas and be ready when international travel returns fully. The timing alsoforcedusto sharpen the marketing of our hotels,” he said. With that, Far East Hospitality has gone ahead with all of its opening plans in Singapore and key overseas markets, such as Australia, Japan and Vietnam. It is also in the process of refurbishing and rebranding several properties within its portfolio. Mr Kiong said the new hotels have “done well” despite the pandemic. These include The Clan Hotel and The Barracks Hotels Sentosa in Singapore which have “delivered better operating results than expected”, he added. RIDING OUT THE PANDEMIC According to the Singapore Tourism Board (STB), overall hotel occupancy averaged 41.7 per cent in February, compared with 43.8 per cent in January and 49.6 per cent in the year-ago period. Occupancy rates were around 83 per cent in January last year, before the coronavirus pandemic annihilated the tourism industry. Industry experts said hotels have been largely kept afloat by government demand as stay-home notice facilities for travellers, as well as domestic staycation bookings following the launch of SingapoRediscovers vouchers. Mr Ervin Yeo, managing director for Southeast Asia at The Ascott, said its properties have managed to maintain “robust occupancy”. For instance, Ascott Orchard Singapore and lyf Funan Singapore had “near 100 per cent occupancy” during the holiday period from Dec 24 to Jan 1. Currently, about half of the guests at these two serviced residences are corporate groups and long-stay guests of between one and 24 months. Ascott has also been adapting its products and services to suit emerging trends. Apart from staycation packages and contactless services, it tried to tap the telecommuting trend by allowing people to book its suites as an alternative to working from home. The “work in residence” initiative has received “positive feedback” since its roll-out in August last year, said Mr Yeo. CHANGING FOR POST-PANDEMIC WORLD Industry players and observers said the worst of the pandemic is over and a “gradual recovery” could be in sight this year. “Assuming a vaccine is effectively rolled out by mid-2021, we anticipate Singapore to introduce more safe travel lanes, comprising Green Lanes, Periodic Commuting Arrangement and Air Travel Pass with countries who havemanaged the pandemic situation well. This will eventually translate to a gradual recovery in international visitors to Singapore in the later half of 2021,” said Mr Zhang. The launch of the tourism vouchers since the end of last year should also help to drive up occupancy and room rates, he added. That said, transformation for a post-pandemic world will be key. The STB, at its annual industry conference held earlier this month, has urged the industry to set its sights on trends including technological innovation, sustainability and holistic wellness. Industry players who spoke to CNA for this story said they are already doing so. “As Singapore prepares to reposition itself for a shift in demand and new travel trends, holistic wellness will be a key strategy,” said Mr Kiong, who noted that the company will focus on the “upper mid-tier and upscale market segment” with its Oasia brand. The upcoming Oasia Resort Sentosa, for instance, will focus on wellness and target health-conscious guests. More than just spa treatments, guests can also expect healthy eating, fitness routines, wellness journals, self-care checklists and access to a collection of guided meditation audio during their stay. The newly opened The Clan Hotel also attempts to merge modern luxury with nostalgia and history from its location near Chinatown.The company is aware that “hotels need to compete as part of a larger concept, in terms of precinct or proposition, rather than a standalone building consisting of rooms”, said Mr Kiong. “Traditional-styled hotels are not enough anymore. In the future, what we may expect will be more innovative hospitality concepts that will better activate the area and be a draw for quality tourism,” he added. For Ascott, its new lyf property at one-north will have several green and sustainability features, such as an energy monitoring system, dual-technology motion sensors and light-emitting diode light fixtures which can achieve energy savings of more than 30 per cent. The property achieved the Green Mark certification from local authorities last year, said Ascott.

A nurse deployed at a general ward in Tan Tock Seng Hospital is among the three unlinked community cases, said the Ministry of Health (MOH). She tested positive for COVID-19 infection on Apr 27 and was warded at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases. The nurse has received both doses of the COVID-19 vaccine. However, it is possible for vaccinated individuals to get infected, said the Health Ministry. Tan Tock Seng Hospital has also locked down the affected Ward 9D, where she was deployed to and tested the patients and staff members who were in the ward. So far, fourcases - a doctor and three patients -have tested preliminarily positive for COVID-19 infection. ICA OFFICER DEPLOYED AT CHANGI AIRPORT AMONG COMMUNITY CASES An Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA) officer deployed at Changi Airport Terminal 1 is among the three cases reported. The man, a 38-year-old Singaporean, had not gone to work after onset of symptoms. He developed a cough on Apr 23 and sought medical treatment the next day at a general practitioner clinic, where he was given two days\\' of medical leave. He developed a fever, anosmia (the loss of the sense of smell) and body aches on Apr 26. The man sought medical treatment at Tan Tock Seng Hospital the next day. He was tested for COVID-19 and his test came back positive on the same day. \"His previous tests from rostered routine testing – the last being onApr 22– were all negative for COVID-19 infection,\" said MOH, adding that his serology test is pending. The other community case is a 58-year-old Singaporean man who works as a construction project manager in Nepal. Identified as Case 62526, the man was in Nepal from Feb 13, 2020 to Dec 13, 2020. The man served his stay-home notice at a dedicated facility until Dec 27 upon returning to Singapore. His test taken on Dec 23 during his quarantine period was negative for COVID-19. He is asymptomatic and was detected when he took a COVID-19 pre-departure test on Apr 26 in preparation for his trip back to Nepal. His test came back positive the next day. He was taken to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases in an ambulance. His serology test is pending. MOH said the man\\'s Ct value is \"very high\", which indicates a low viral load. \"He could be shedding minute fragments of the virus RNA from a past infection which are no longer transmissible and infective to others, but given that we are not able to definitively conclude when he had been infected, we will take all the necessary public health actions as a precautionary measure,\" it added. IMPORTED CASES The remaining 20 cases were imported and were placed on stay-home notice or isolated upon arrival in Singapore, said MOH. Two Singaporeans and a permanent resident who returned from India and the UAE were among the 20 imported cases reported on Wednesday. One is a dependent\\'s pass holders who arrived from Nepal and five are work pass holders who arrived from India, Japan, the Maldives, Nepal and Uzbekistan. Two foreign domestic workers areamong six work permit holders who arrived from Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Mexico and the Philippines. Four other cases are short-term visit pass holders.

NEW CLUSTER ATWESTLITE WOODLANDS DORMITORY Five COVID-19 cases who are “likely” reinfections have been found at Westlite Woodlands dormitory, MOH said on Tuesday. The five cases occupied the same room at the dormitory together with Cases 62181 and 62225, residents who have previously tested positive for COVID-19, forming a new cluster. The five men are part of 24 recovered workers who have been found to be positive for the coronavirus as part of special testing operations for Westlite Woodlands dormitory residents. The ministry said that 11 of the 24 cases have been assessed to be shedding virus fragments. Two of them are negative upon retesting while the remaining six cases are pending assessment by an expert panel. The tests were done as part of investigations into Case 62181, who tested positive for COVID-19 on Apr 19. The workers were not included in Tuesday\\'s new case numbers. PRE-EMPTIVETESTING AT DORMITORIES, WORKSITES Pre-emptive COVID-19 testingis being conducted in dormitories and worksites after the cluster at Westlite Woodlands Dormitory was reported, said the Ministry of Manpower on Wednesday. More than 5,500 workers were tested between Apr 23 and Apr 26. These tests are in addition to the routine tests conducted on dormitory residents every two weeks. Workers who have recovered from COVID-19 and those who have never been infected are included. Movement restrictions or quarantines may also be imposed on a dormitory if a few workers there test positive for COVID-19, said MOM. It added that this precaution is necessary only for the duration of the assessmentand will be lifted when testshave concluded. Workers can still access communal facilities and recreation centres in dormitories, with regulations in place to prevent residents from mingling. However, movement between dormitory blocks is not allowed and safe management measures have been stepped up. As of Wednesday, Singapore has reported a total of 61,086 COVID-19 cases.

We must expect such ups and downs, which is why we have set the target launch date of the air travel bubble a month after the announcement,\" said a ministry spokesperson in an email reply to queries from CNA. \"We need to continuously find ways to gradually open up our borders for air travel, to ensure the long-term survival of Changi Airport and Singapore Airlines.\" Responding to a reporter\\'s question about the travel bubble during the COVID-19 multi-ministry task force press conference on Tuesday, Education Minister Lawrence Wongsaid Singapore and Hong Kong \"remain in touch\". \"We will monitor the situation and we will review and assess whether or not there will be any changes and give updates in due course,\" he said. When the travel bubble was announced, for the second time, on Apr 26, it was set to launch on May 26. This came after a previous launch in November 2020 was delayed after a spike in cases in Hong Kong. But there has now been a jump in local cases in Singapore which prompted authorities here to tighten COVID-19 management measures from May 8 to May 30. Singapore has also announced tougher border restrictions, extending stay-home notices to 21 days for travellers fromhigher-risk countries or regions. Under the terms of the agreement, the Singapore-Hong Kong travel bubble will be suspended for at least 14 days if the seven-day moving average of unlinked local COVID-19 cases a day, excluding dormitory resident cases in Singapore, is more than five in either Singapore or Hong Kong. Singapore\\'s cases have not reached that threshold. The number of new cases in the community has increased from 11 cases in the week before to 64 cases in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has also increased from fourcases in the week before to 10 cases in the past week, MOH said in an update on Tuesday night.

Brazil\\'s P1 coronavirus variant, behind a deadly COVID-19 surge in Brazil, has spread throughout hard-hit Latin America. Scientists in Brazil have found that the variant\\'s mutations could make it more resistant to antibodies, raising international concern over its potential to render vaccines less effective. The Argentina-based study, carried out by the DrVanella Institute of Virology of the National University of Córdoba (UNC), however, found a strong immune response against the variant in those vaccinated with Sputnik V. \"The study confirmed that the immunity developed in people vaccinated with \\'Sputnik V\\' neutralises the Brazilian strain after having received two doses, and even after the first,\" the RDIF said in a statement on Monday. According to the Argentine study, viewed by Reuters and cited by RDIF, 85.5 per cent of individuals developed antibodies against the COVID-19 variant on day 14 following the first dose of the vaccine. That rate rose to nearly 100 per cent by day 42, after an individual had received both doses. Rogelio Pizzi, dean of the Faculty of Medical Sciences of the UNC, told Reuters the institute\\'s study showed that the Russian vaccine successfully inhibits the variant. \"The results are excellent. The vaccine works for this strain,\" Pizzi told Reuters, adding that the UNC Institute of Virology is also conducting studies on the strain originally detected in the UK.

       " {'text': \"singapore post covid economic growth gdp sectors tech exports 14719144 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners Even though economic recovery is narrow for now, the momentum for growth is strong, and businesses should build on this to embrace transformation fully, says SBF CEO Lam Yi Young. SINGAPORE: What do papadums have to do with a post-COVID Singapore economy? Plenty, apparently. While much of the attention has been on the latest economic data which shows the Singapore economy is on a positive path to recovery, a curious case of papadums reveal where those pockets of opportunity may lie. Indeed, although it seems that recovery may be uneven across sectors, the contours of Singapore’s post-COVID economy are coming into sharper focus – and it is vital for businesses to identify how best to position themselves for the upturn. Overall, there are encouraging signs for the domestic economy. Singapore's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 0.2 per cent year-on-year in the first quarter of 2021, a turnaround from three quarters of contraction, based on advance estimates by the Ministry of Trade and Industry released on Apr 14. It’s still early days but there is cautious optimism the Singapore economy is turning the corner out of the pandemic. Interestingly, the first quarter GDP for 2021 is slightly higher than the same time last year, just before the circuit breaker. DIGITALISATION FUELLING RECOVERY Although economic recovery is narrow and limited to a few sectors for now, the momentum for growth is strong. Singapore’s factory output expanded for a fifth straight month, according to the monthly manufacturing performance data released by the Economic Development Board (EDB) last month. Never mind the slight decline of 1.7 per cent in March since this was partially due to a weak global oil and gas market and travel restrictions – resulting in lower orders in the marine and offshore engineering and aerospace sectors. The positive take-away is the strong drive for digitalisation, which saw electronic output continue to increase – 33.7 per cent in March 2021 from the same period last year and 28.1 per cent on a year-to-date basis over the same period last year. Some good came out of the pandemic where companies were forced to pivot towards digitalisation and remote-working. They are also embracing cloud services, data centres and 5G markets, which explains the stronger output in semiconductors, computer peripherals and data storage segments. Growth in these segments should pick up as digitalisation continues apace. It looks like the email address you entered is not valid. No doubt robust global semiconductor demand also drove strong growth in Singapore’s exports, although trade in petrochemicals also underpinned this surge. Non-oil domestic exports (NODX) also expanded 12.1 per cent year-on-year in March, with exports to China leading the strong rebound at an increase of 46.4 per cent from the previous month as the Chinese market demanded more specialised machinery, petrochemicals and primary chemicals. This is significant as growth in petrochemicals exports is a bellwether for wider recovery and growth in other sectors around the world. Nevertheless, sectors such as transportation and storage see continued weakness, still battered by the travel restrictions brought about by the pandemic. While countries take baby steps to establish travel bubbles and roll out vaccination of their population on a larger scale, the mass reopening of international borders is unlikely to happen this year. Sectors based on footfall, such as retail and food and beverage, are also likely to see slower recovery, with the lack of tourists and shifts towards e-commerce. The construction sector is currently supported by a pickup in public and private sector construction activities. However, challenges in manpower supply – particularly with recent restrictions on labour from India due to the explosion in infections there – coupled with shortages in materials supply, and work arrangements with safe distancing measures mean this sector will face strong headwinds. Notwithstanding this, business sentiments are on the rise, and the highest since the pandemic began last year, according to the SBF-Experian SME Index (for the second and third quarter of 2021), a study that measures forward-looking business sentiments of local SMEs. (Listen to Singapore economists debate the trade-offs in choosing which sectors, companies and workers to aid during this COVID-19 downturn in CNA's Heart of the Matter published in August 2020:) BUILDING RESILIENCE THROUGH DIGITALISATION AND TRANSFORMATION So what do these indicators mean for companies and sectors here? The manufacturing, information and communications, finance and insurance sectors are expected to remain resilient for the rest of the year, if current conditions hold. This is in line with global trends and is unsurprising given that the pandemic has accelerated digitalisation across a wide range of sectors and businesses. Moreover, 72 per cent of businesses with a high level of transformation are confident in sustaining their business over the next 12 months, according to the recent SBF National Business Survey conducted in October and November 2020. One such company is Exceed Tech, an electronics manufacturer that designs and produces ultra-sensitive sensors targeting the industrial, telematics and healthcare markets. It successfully implemented a system to remotely track operations in its production facilities in Shenzhen, China from its headquarters in Singapore through the Industry 4.0 Human Capital Initiative (IHCI) Enabler Programme, a programme supported by Workforce Singapore. Its management achieved greater visibility of shopfloor operations, to make more informed decisions, leading to an increase in output by 21 per cent. The company also tapped on insights yielded by data, to improve the accuracy of its assembly line and reduce operational costs by close to 30 per cent. LOOKING BEYOND OUR SHORES As the export data shows, there are opportunities overseas that Singapore companies must seize despite the pandemic. Caught up with day-to-day operations, internationalisation may be the furthest thing from the minds of SMEs. But with an open mind and the right mindset, they can uncover unexpected opportunities. So here’s where papadums foretell the spicy story of Singapore’s economic outlook. Bhavani Stores worked closely with GlobalConnect@SBF, a programme supported by Enterprise Singapore, on a food hamper project to showcase Singapore food products in Vietnamese supermarkets earlier this year during the Vietnamese New Year holiday. This helped their Uncle Saba’s Poppadoms brand of papadum snacks gain an initial foothold in Vietnam. The company is now in the process of bringing its “Poppadoms” to more supermarkets in Vietnam through local distributors. RIGHT-SIZING MANPOWER However, even as companies navigate these challenges and look to seize the opportunities ahead, the pandemic has also impacted jobs and workers in many ways. Manpower-intensive sectors such as manufacturing, healthcare, F&B, and retail have had to grapple with labour shortages with the impact of travel restrictions on inflow of foreign manpower. The jobs companies are looking to fill include service crew, cooks, drivers, factory operators and patient service associates. This shortfall is mainly in the S$2,000 to S$3,000 salary band, in roles requiring repetitive tasks, like the operating of machinery, customer service and people skills. The labour shortage has meant more job hopping and higher staff turnover for companies, plus higher costs, and is not expected to ease soon. Companies must look at transformation and job redesign to help cope with the tight labour situation. As they digitalise and transform, companies must upskill staff, especially rank and file workers, to handle more complex and cognitive-driven tasks. Workers must also move towards becoming more multi-skilled to take on more critical tasks. There are many government schemes available to support companies and workers in upskilling, and companies and workers should make good use of them. The road to recovery is in sight. Our trade associations and business chambers stand ready to help our companies on their recovery and to seize new opportunities so as to emerge stronger from the pandemic.

       " {'text': 'covid 19 people limit social interactions maximum of 2 day 14719898 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE:In view of the growing number of COVID-19 community cases, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Friday (Apr 30) that individuals should limit their social interactions. While the current eight-person limit on unique household visitors and gatherings in public places remains in place, MOH’s guidance is that such social interactions should be capped at two per day. “Over the past week, we have seen an increase in the number of local cases, some of which are currently unlinked and have resulted in the formation of community clusters,” the ministry said in a media release. “We therefore have to move quickly to reduce the level of interactions in the community and break the chains of transmission. “Going forward, all individuals should limit their overall number of social interactions, to not more than two per day, whether visiting another household or meeting with friends/family members in a public place,” MOH said. MALL LIMITS REINSTATED Additional COVID-19measures will be also be implemented from Saturday until May 14. From Saturday, the occupancy limit at malls and large standalone stores will be reduced to one person per 10 sq m of gross floor area, down from the current one person per 8 sq m. Odd and even date entry restrictions will also be reinstated at popular malls Lucky Plaza and Peninsula Plaza on Sundays. These restrictions were previously lifted on Apr 10 after being in place for nearly eight months. Outdoor barbecue pits and campsites will also be closed to the public until May 14. These include barbecue pits at parks, HDB estates, condominiums and country clubs. Finally, attractions that have received prior approval from the Ministry of Trade and Industry will have to reduce their operating capacity from 65 per cent to 50 per cent from May 7 to 14. INCONVENIENT, BUT NECESSARY: MINISTER Speaking at a press conference by the COVID-19 multi-ministry task force, co-chairLawrence Wong said that these measures are necessary even if they are inconvenient. “We know these new restrictions will, you know, create inconvenience for everyone. It\\'s not easy, becausein the month of May, there are three public holidays. We have May Day coming up tomorrow, Hari Raya later on, and then Vesak Day, towards the end of May,\" he said. “I know many are looking forward to these public holidays - you will have made plans, you may want to gather together, you may want to socialise, meet your family and friends - but I seek everyone\\'s cooperation to scale back your social activities and comply with all the prevailing rules. “This is the only way we can ensure that we slow down the spread of the virus in the community.\" Mr Wong, who is also the Education Minister,added that further tightening of restrictions may be required, should the COVID-19 situation worsen. “We have to be mentally prepared, too, that if the situation were to worsen - despite all that we are doing and despite all the new restrictions - if the situation were to worsen, we may have to consider further tightening and significantly reducing interactions in the community, with more stringent measures,\" he said. “It\\'s been about a year since we entered and then exited the ‘circuit breaker’, and since then we have embarked on a path of reopening and resumption of activities, but from the very start we have emphasised that this will not be a one-way street. “There will be stops and starts, and there will be bumps along the way. We are encountering now one such bump in our journey of reopening. “But let us also take confidence in the fact that, today, we have better capabilities and tools to control the infection. “So if we stay disciplined and vigilant, and if we all do our part, I am confident we can get through this bump, and get back on track towards our path of reopening the economy.” WORK-FROM-HOME ARRANGEMENTS MOH also advised employers to allow their employees to work from home if they are able to do so. The ministry said that employers should continue to stagger start times of employees who need to return to their workplaces and implement flexible working hours. MOH added that public agencies working in the Novena area - where Tan Tock Seng Hospital is located - will be asking their staff to work from home where possible. These include theMinistry of Home Affairs and the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore. \"These measures help lower transmission risks by reducing interactions at the workplace and in public places, including public transport,\" the ministry said.

       " {'text': 'possibility of circuit breaker not ruled out covid 19 singapore 14742990 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: Singapore has not ruled out the possibility of another “circuit breaker” in light of the recent increase in COVID-19 cases in the community, but it hopes to avoid that situation withnewly announced restrictions, said Health Minister Gan Kim Yong. The Ministry of Health on Tuesday (May 4) announced further tightening of COVID-19 measures, including limiting social gatherings and the number of distinct visitors to a home to five people from May 8 to May 30. This is a reduction from the eight people allowed currently. Among other changes, the proportion of employees allowed to return to the workplace will also be reduced during the same period, whilecapacity will be reduced at attractions, libraries, tours and MICE events. “I think it\\'s important for us to clarify that we have not ruled out the possibility of a circuit breaker. Certainly we hope that we won\\'t get there and we must do what we can with this set of measures we\\'ve just announced,” Mr Gan said at the press conference of the multi-ministry task force, which he co-chairs. \"With the cooperation and support of all Singaporeans, I think we probably will be able to avoid having to get to a circuit breaker situation but we cannot rule that out,\" he added. \"And that is why we will continueto remain vigilant,monitor the situation and adjust our measures as we go along.\" Education Minister Lawrence Wong likened the new set of restrictions as a move “back to Phase 2”. He added that the situation currently “is not quite the same” as last year when the circuit breaker was implemented. The circuit breaker period was in place from Apr 7 to Jun 1 last year, with measures that include home-based schooling and most workplaces being shut. “If we look at the indicators in terms of unlinked cases and more carefully in terms of what we are picking out from the sentinel surveillance, I wouldn\\'t say that the situation is where we were ... before we entered the circuit breaker last year,\" said Mr Wong,in response to a question about why authorities are taking a “phased approach” with the tightening of measures. \"We\\'ll likenit more to the early phase when we entered into the COVID-19 outbreak and we were seeing sprinkling of community cases ...Maybe more like the situation (in) February, March, rather than right before the circuit breaker, so there is a qualitative difference in the situation assessment by our public health experts,\" he added. Singapore also has “far better” capabilities when it comes to testing and contact tracing now.These allow the authorities to movefaster in identifying potential close contacts and having them tested. \"We think we are able to snuff out the current outbreak of clusters and bring things under control,” said the ministerwho co-chairs the multi-ministry task force with Mr Gan. “But as an additional pre-emptive step, we are taking this move that we have just described - bringing the whole suite of measures back to Phase 2and taking a much tighter posture overall,\" said Mr Wong. “And we believe that if we do that and if everyone cooperates from now to the ... end of May, we have a good chance of bringing cases down and getting things back on control.” GAN KIM YONG TO STAY ON IN COVID-19 TASK FORCE Mr Gan, who will move to theMinistry of Trade and Industry on May 15 as part of the recent Cabinet reshuffle, also said that he will continue to be involved in the COVID-19 multi-ministry task force. Current Transport Minister Ong Ye Kung is set to take over as Minister for Health. Mr Gan, who has been the Health Minister for almost a decade and played a key role in Singapore’s fight against the pandemic thus far, said: “I have been discussing with my co-chair Minister Lawrence Wong, as well as the incoming Minister for Health Ong Ye Kung, and we discussed how we can ensure continuity.\" He added:“The three of us will continue to be involved in the (multi-ministry task force) and we will continue to share and support one another as we go ahead. \"Even if I move to the Ministry of Trade and Industry, I will continue to work with the other two co-chairs in order to make sure that there is continuity.” Downloadourappor subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

All inmates\\' face-to-face visits and tele-visits will also be replaced by phone calls with effect from May 17 until further notice, the Singapore Prison Service (SPS) said on Saturday (May 15). The cook who is a confirmed case is a contract staff working in the prison kitchen located at Institution A5 in Cluster A of Changi Prison, said SPS. He is employed by SATS Food Services. The man, known as Case 63160, was reported as an unlinked community case by the Ministry of Health (MOH) on Friday. He is fully vaccinated. The 39-year-old last reported to work on Wednesday. He felt unwell after work,developing a fever and runny nose, and sought medical treatment at a general practitioner clinicwhere he received a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for COVID-19. His test result came back positive the next day. SPS said it immediately ceased kitchen operations at Institution A5 and started contact tracing among staff and inmates upon confirmation of his infection. All close contacts of the man have been isolated or placed in quarantine pendingissuance of a quarantine order,said the service. Affected inmates will serve their quarantine orders in prison, isolated from the rest of the inmate population. Staff, vendors and volunteers will serve theirs at MOH\\'s designated quarantine facility. TESTING FOR CLUSTER A As a precautionary measure, activitiesincluding family visits, counselling sessions and non-critical hospital appointments have been halted in Institution A5 where the cook worked, said SPS. All affected areas have also been thoroughly cleaned and disinfected. PCR testing has started for all inmates, staff, vendors and volunteers who have been to Institution A5 from Monday to Wednesday. About 1,050 inmates, staff and partners will be tested, said SPS. The Changi Prison complex comprises two clusters, Cluster A and Cluster B, each of which contains five institutions. Cluster A comprises Institutions A1, A2, A3, A4 and A5. SPS said it willtake a \"highly precautionary measure\" totest all inmates, staff and partners from Cluster A while the testresults for those placed on quarantine order are pending. \"This is to ensure that the virus does not spread undetected within prisons, and that any asymptomatic cases are promptly identified and isolated,\" said the service. About 5,000 people will be progressively tested over the next few days. Inmate activities including rehabilitation programmes will be suspended to facilitate the testing, said SPS. NO FACE-TO-FACE OR TELE-VISITS In view of the tighter measures to reduce the risk of COVID-19 community transmission, there will be no face-to-face visits and tele-visits for all inmates from May 17 until further notice. These will be replaced with phone calls, said SPS. The measures are implemented from May 17 as face-to-face visits and tele-visits do not take place on Sundays, said the service. Families who have already booked their visits will have them automatically converted to phone calls. Inmates can also continue to communicate with their families through e-letters. SPS has also suspended all rehabilitation programmes conducted by vendors and volunteers during this period. \"These are important, preventive steps taken by SPS, for the safety of our inmates and theirfamilies, staff and partners, and they complement existing measures that have been in place since the onset of COVID-19,\" said the service. SPS said it has also increased the duration of cohort segregation for newly admitted inmates from 14 to 21 days, since May 8. Newly admitted inmates will undergo PCR tests upon admission, as well as on the 14th and 20th day of segregation, it said. They are allowed to join the general inmate population after testing negative at the end of the cohort segregation period.

The restriction does not apply to passengers from the same household. For example, a parent can travel with his or her two children if they live together, LTA said. Singapore on Sunday entered what authorities called Phase 2 (Heightened Alert), after a spike in COVID-19 cases in the community. The tightened restrictions will last until Jun 13. In a press release on Sunday, the LTA said it is implementing some measures to minimise interaction and the risk of COVID-19 transmission during commuting. All commercial car-pooling services such as GrabHitch and RydePool, where drivers are paid for ferrying passengers while en route to their destination, will be barred until Jun 13. Non-commercial car-pooling trips are only permitted among friends or colleagues if the prevailing permissible group size of two people is adhered to, LTA said. For example, if a group of colleagues is travelling together, they must split into groups of not more than two. LTA urged commuters to use taxis and private-hire cars booked through their respective ride-hail applications. Members of the public who come across individuals providing illegal car-pooling services should notify LTA through the OneMotoring portal using the e-service, “Report Vehicle-Related Offences”, it said. It also reminded passengers that it is mandatory for drivers and passengers to wear masks at all times. Taxi and private-hire drivers should decline to pick up passengers who do not wear masks, it said. “When travelling on public transport, commuters should try to spread themselves out or travel off-peak periods where possible,” LTA said. Former Transport Minister Ong Ye Kung, who has since taken over the health ministry portfolio, said last Friday that public transport is safe if commuters refrain from talking and keep their masks on. “Be assured that the air ventilation within the train is actually very good. Excluding the opening and closing of train doors, every six minutes, all the air is being replenished,” Mr Ong said during a press conference held by the multi-ministry COVID-19 task force to announce the tightened restrictions. Before the latest measures, commuter volumes have been at around70 per cent ofpre-pandemic levels, he said. LTA saidthe figure has droppedto about 40 per cent for central business district journeys by train.

More than 10 Members of Parliament filed questions related to vaccines and the pandemic, including one from MP Liang Eng Hwa (PAP-Bukit Panjang) on the progress of Singapore's evaluation of the Sinovacvaccine. MP Saktiandi Supaat (PAP-Bishan Toa Payoh) asked which are the three countries that accounted for the most number of imported cases in the past six months, and what other measuresthe Ministry of Health can take to ensure virus variants do not emerge in Singapore from imported cases. MP Ng Ling Ling (PAP-Ang Mo Kio) submitted a question on ensuring the effectiveness of the vaccine, in light of recent cases where vaccinated people were infected, whileMP Alex Yam (PAP-Marsiling-Yew Tee) asked if the Ministry of Health is concerned about how effective vaccines will be against new strains of the virus. Leader of the Opposition Pritam Singh asked what strategies have been put in place to address misinformation related to COVID-19 vaccinations. MP SylviaLim (WP-Aljunied) asked how many claims have been made under the Vaccine Injury Financial Assistance Programme to date, and how many have been successful. Other issues that are on the agenda include thesafety of migrant workers transported in lorries and the flash floods in the Bukit Timah area on Apr 17. Minister for Communications and Information S Iswaran will also deliver a ministerial statement on the structuring of Singapore Press Holdings (SPH), after it was announced on Thursday that the company will restructure its media business into not-for-profit entity.

In response to CNA\\'s queries, both ministries said in a joint reply thatstudents and staff members living in autonomous university hostels have been alerted via SMS that they will be offered the jabs. \"They will be able to book a slot at the community vaccination centres across the island. Individuals who are medically eligible to take up the vaccination are strongly encouraged to do so when offered, to safeguard their health and that of the wider community,\" said the ministries. MOE and MOH said they had been working on the possibility ofprioritising hostel residents for vaccination, given the \"potential for rapid transmission and outbreaks as a result of the close-density and communal nature of living in the hostels\". The decision to offer the vaccinations to staff members and students living in hostels was made after taking into consideration the \"relative risks\". \"Vaccination is critical in the fight against COVID-19,\" said the ministries. \"Given that vaccine supplies continue to be limited, vaccinations are being progressively rolled out to Singaporeans. \"MOH has given priority to individuals at higher risk such as healthcare workers, COVID-19 frontline workers, other vulnerable groups and those living in a communal setting.\" MOE also said it wouldcontinue to work closely with MOH on how the vaccination programme can be expanded for the rest of the staff members and students in the education sector.

       " {'text': 'singapore phua chu kang advertisement vaccination covid 19 14780310 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners Whether you found it tacky or catchy (or both), the Phua Chu Kang-fronted COVID-19 vaccination music video sure got everyone’s attention. Isn’t that half the battle won, asks Tracy Lee. SINGAPORE: By now, you’ve probably seen Get Your Shot, Steady Pom Pi Pi, the colourful, raucous Singlish-inflected rap music video. The video features local 1990s sitcom character Phua Chu Kang (PCK) exhorting all the doubters and stragglers among us to “Faster go and vaccinate” against COVID-19, with his characteristic cheesy lyrics and dance moves. Less than a week after its May 2 release, the video has attracted hundreds of thousands of views. People were divided on its effectiveness and appropriateness. Comments ranged from the mean (“I should have gotten my vaccine before watching this video - because this is viral”) to the downright evil (“If ever there was a prize for being a village idiot, this guy takes it to a whole new level!!!”) and the snobbish (“I guess the Government’sgiven up on the Speak Good English campaign”). PCK however found traction with his supporter base (“This put a smile on my face. PCK is so classic”), some of whom wanted even more(“If I vaccinate, will we get a season 9 of PCK?”) and were not afraid to use all-caps to show their love (“SO CRINGE THAT I LOVE IT”). Speaker of Parliament Tan Chuan-Jin even cheekily tweeted: “Get vaccinated! Otherwise we will have to keep playing this video ad nauseum”. This time PCK outdid even himself. He was not only best in Singapore, JB (JohorBahru), and some say, Batam – as his character famously used to say in each episode of the sitcom’s heydays – he made international headlines. The foreign press took note of the viral video. British daily The Guardian favourably described the song as giving “surprisingly detailed medical advice” in the form of “informative disco”. SO EMBARRASSING I have to admit, I groaned when I first set eyes on it, then quickly forwarded the clip to my friends with the comment “so embarrassing!” Don’t get me wrong. I’ve absolutely adored Gurmit Singh as Phua Chu Kang (and Irene Ang as Rosie)ever since the sitcom about a loveably eccentric ah beng contractor and his garrulous family came into our lives in 1997. That PCK won Best Comedy Programmeat the Asian Television Awards for six consecutive years (from 1998 to 2003), that it enjoyed an eight-season run over 10 years, and that its extremely talented lead character still commands instant recognition 24 years on, just goto show what an enduring pop culture icon and national treasure PCK has become. It looks like the email address you entered is not valid. Yet I couldn’t help feeling I was getting a little tired of the fact that every time a public service message needs announcing, PCK is tapped on to deliver it with buckets full of Singlish kitsch. To his credit, he does that incredibly well. But is there no other way to hammer home an important public message? After all, PCK had already done a rap for the 2003 SARS epidemic. Since the COVID-19 pandemic struck in 2020, he has also already appeared in a techno-style music video called Singapore Be Steady, and another video where he speaks about how Singaporeans can protect themselvesfrom COVID-19. Singapore has no shortage of accolades in dealing with the coronavirus, such as when Bloomberg ranked us the best place in the world to be during the pandemic. We seem to be a pretty modern, sophisticated country that can get its act together and run a tight ship in the face of a persistent virus wreaking havoc across the world. But these days, thanks to the Internet and social media, any public message crafted for local consumption can be shared with or accessed by anyone, anywhere. Can we afford to have the rest of the world think Singaporeans have a mental age of five-year-olds, when we’re supposed to be a global centre for innovative technology, with future-ready and world-class talent? And should we accept that cringe-worthy public communications will always be standard fare for public service announcements and government messaging? BUT IT GETS THE JOB DONE For now, looking at the global scale of the health crisis and its attendant risks, perhaps the practical answer might be: Whatever works to get the job done. Perhapsbare facts are just too boring — who even remembers those sterile mask-wearing or safe distancing campaigns? Moreover, according to Fortune, such serious public health advertising may be counter-effective “because it incites people’s worst fears rather than provideclear steps viewers can take to save lives”. Besides, sometimes celebrities are the most effective way to drum home that message. “For some people, having celebrities who are familiar, seeing their faces, hearing them speaking up and saying they are taking the vaccine, or they can vouch for the safety of it, will be convincing,” Dr Lisa Cooper, director of John Hopkins Centre for Health Equity told CNBC recently. This has held true for decades outside Singapore. After a photo of Elvis Presley getting vaccinated against polio backstage at The Ed Sullivan Show was splashed all over American papers in the 1950s, the polio vaccination rate among youth went from a measly 0.6 per cent to 60 per cent in six months. So then what better way than to use the PCK character - with song, dance, humourand in a way that canbe understood by Singaporeans of all ages. Heck, it was even done in rhyming verses. Public health campaigns are not easy to design. They need to influence public knowledge, attitudes and behaviours, urgently so and with high stakes in the case of COVID-19. They can have patchy results. Sometimes, there isn’t a clear or direct relationship between the messages sent to people and the reactions these people have to the messages. In addition to interpreting messages in very unique ways, experts have also pointed out how people respond differently to messages received, and therefore, the campaign planner must take many different communication variables into account. Is this message clear and compelling for the intended audience? Will the audience pay attention to it? Will they adjust their behaviours in response? Hence, an effective communication campaign must use carefully designed messages that not only match the interests and abilities of the audience, but also channels the target audience trusts and can easily access. As such, considerations of wide appeal, expediency and other lowest common denominators are more likely to hold sway than refinement or wit. (Are COVID-19 vaccines still effective against new variants? And could these increase the risk of reinfection? Experts explain why COVID-19 could become a “chronic problem\" on CNA\\'s Heart of the Matter podcast.) RAISE OUR BAR FOR PUBLIC CAMPAIGNS PCK’s latest video has certainly got our attention, we’ve talked about it endlessly over this week, and if you still haven’t seen it, you can on YouTube. Perhaps the Singapore Government is wise to stick with Uncle Phuafor now. Our leaders are better off fussing over pressing matters in tackling this latest coronavirus wave in Singapore, and worrying how we are going to cope with fewer construction workers and domestic workers. Like him or hate him, you cannot deny PCK is the most recognisable, relatable national personality. He resonates with most of us. That is probably why every time the Singapore Government needs to send an urgent and serious message – be it SARS and COVID-19 - PCK is called upon. Perhaps the bigger question is why we haven’t seen another national television icon rise after 24 years. Still, I would challenge government communicators to do better for the next public education campaign that doesn’t insult our intelligence, nor make us look like a parochial backwater to outsiders. In the meantime, all the young kids in Singapore who’ve heard the song have probably memorised it and are incessantly singing its catchy and rhyming lyrics at home. That could prove the most effective way to remind parents and grandparents that the vaccination is “safe for most including elderly, because the government got check properly”.

       " {'text': 'covid 19 vaccination take up rate more seniors 14713762 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: The take-up rate of COVID-19 vaccination among seniors is acceptable, or even good, but more can be done to boost numbers, infectious diseases experts said. Senior Minister of State for Health Janil Puthucheary said earlier this month thatabout 60 per centof eligible seniors aged 70 and above have received the COVID-19 vaccination or booked their vaccination appointments, while the corresponding proportion for eligible seniors aged 60 to 69 is close to 70 per cent. Infectious diseases experts said that the proportion is good, especially in comparison to the take-up rate of the influenza vaccination, which they said is the most comparable to the COVID-19 vaccination. “I think it’s an acceptable figure. If you look at the influenza vaccination, which has been promoted annually, we don’t even achieve 15 to 20 per cent, so this is actually very good,” said infectious diseases specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital Dr Leong Hoe Nam. When asked if the better take-up for the COVID-19 vaccination is because it is potentially fatal, he said that the flu can also be fatal, taking the lives of 200 out of every 100,000 people aged 70 and above annually in Singapore. Influenza can trigger heart attack and stroke, he explained. Professor Paul Tambyah, president of the Asia Pacific Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infection, said that the take-up rate among seniors is “really good”. “Flu is also known to be fatal in elderly people. In fact, it\\'s probably comparable fatality rate (with COVID-19), especially among the very old,” he said. However, experts said there is a need for more seniors to be vaccinated. \"We want vaccine uptake to be as high as possible,\" said Dr Hannah Clapham, Assistant Professor at the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health. There are two reasons for wanting a high level of vaccination - so that people are protected from COVID-19 and to boost population immunity. “For the senior group, the first reason is very important as if people in this group become infected, they have a high risk of severe disease,” she said. People should get vaccinated so that “as a whole, as a country, we can boostour population-based immunity and as a result of that, we may be able to inch towards normalcy”, said Dr Ling Li Min, an infectious diseases physician at Rophi Clinic. WHAT IS BEING DONE TO ENCOURAGE SENIORS Such health and community benefits are among the explanations Silver Generation Office (SGO) volunteer Vesuvasam Perianar gives to seniors when he goes door to door to engage them. SGO,the outreach arm of the Agency for Integrated Care, has been engaging seniors since February this year with the help of about 3,000 volunteers. “Our main job is to ask them if they have received the letters. If they have and have not made the appointment we will ask them why they have not made the appointment,” the 68-year-old told CNA. If seniors indicate that they need help in booking a slot, Mr Perianar will help them on the spot. “In most cases, they will say ‘my children will help, but they haven’t had time, they will do it in a short while, maybe a few days later’,” he said. Others may be waiting for their next medical appointment in a month or two with their regular doctors to make sure that the vaccination is safe for them, he added. Information on their plans to register for a slot goes into a report he has to create at the end of these sessions, Mr Perianar said. Based on the report, a volunteer - not necessarily him - will then go back to the home to get an update on the status of the booking. Mr Perianar does these engagements with a partner four times a week for about two hours each time. SGO also arranges transport for seniors who are not able to get to a vaccination centre on their own, he said. Mr Perianar said that while the majority of the seniors he approaches would say that they would be booking an appointment, or need help doing so, about 20 per cent of them would be sceptical or distrustful of the vaccination regime. To convince seniors, he tells them that they may not be able to travel overseas, even for religious pilgrimage, without the vaccination. He also uses himself as an example of someone who has had the vaccination. He said: “Sometimes after we speak for a while … they will be more open. They will say ‘ok lah, I’ll consider lah’.” Still, some of them are “very adverse”, calling the regime a “government gimmick”and refusing to accept a leaflet containing more information, he said. He said that some of them bring up negative news about vaccination and have fears of overdosing, or deaths that they misunderstand that have happened because of the vaccination. BARRIERS TO VACCINATION Dr Leong said individuals have different reasons for not wanting to get the vaccination. “There are many elderly people whom I have spoken to who say: ‘I’m not afraid of COVID-19. In fact if I die, so be it. I’m not afraid of dying’,” he said. Barriers to seniors getting vaccinated could include mobility, logistics and understanding of the vaccination, said Dr Ling. “They (seniors) may at times listen to their friends more than what is on the mainstream media. Sometimes, older folks, they could have more inertia to get themselves vaccinated,” she said. Some of them may not feel the need to get the vaccination especially if community numbers are low and they don’t go out so much, she added. Dr Clarence Tam, Assistant Professor at the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, said that findings from a survey he recently conducted with his team suggest that many people are taking a wait-and-seeapproach. “They are unsure if the benefits of vaccination outweigh the potential risks of side effects, particularly given that the risk of contracting COVID-19 is currently low,” said Dr Tam. The survey, which has not been published, was conducted online earlier this month among 1,000 Singapore residents aged 21 and above. Findings were similar among seniors and other groups, he added. WHAT CAN BE DONE TO IMPROVE TAKE-UP AMONG SENIORS When asked what would make them more willing to get vaccinated, respondents commonly mentioned personal recommendations from healthcare professionals, family, employers, friends and the Government, said Dr Tam. For a third of respondents, a strong motivator would be the relaxation of social distancing rules if many people are vaccinated, he added. Seeing positive stories on social media from people who had been vaccinated would also make them willing, Dr Tam said. In contrast, people would be put off vaccination if a family member had a bad reaction to the vaccine, if friends or family advised against vaccinationor if they saw content on social media advising against vaccination, he said. “Positive reinforcement and prompts from a broad range of trusted sources will be needed to encourage undecided individuals to get vaccinated,” he said, adding that healthcare professionals have an important role to play, particularly in allaying worries about side effects. Dr Leong, who said that Singapore should increase the proportion of vaccinated seniors by 10 per cent, said that videos of elderly public figures getting vaccinated could help. The narrative used to convince the elderly should revolve around helping their families, he said. “It could be someone saying ‘I am a grandmother, I am 70 years old, I am getting myself vaccinated because of my grandchildren’,” he said. Another way is to regularly organise trips to vaccination centres for seniors, ferrying five seniors at a go. “What we have to do is literally take the mountain to Muhammad,” he said. However, Dr Leong said that he expects many seniors who have not been vaccinated to be immobileand that they may not account for much in overall herd immunity. “Individuals who are mobile, interacting in public areas are more important in the calculation of herd immunity. These individuals tend to be more well-informed, a bit on the younger side of 70 and they would be interacting with their peers,” he said.

       " {'text': 'be obsessed with wearing masks properly experts urge compliance 14731868 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: The growing number of COVID-19 clusters in the community are a concern, experts said, as they urged people to take existing safety measures seriously and monitor their health. Senior consultant at the National University Hospital’s division of infectious disease Professor Dale Fisher said that the community cases are a “major test” for Singapore. “The question is whether our public health systems and community behaviours can respond adequately to avoid another circuit breaker,” said Prof Fisher, who is also chair of the national infection prevention and control committee at the Ministry of Health (MOH). He urged people not to go out unnecessarily for the next few weeks and to minimise mingling with people outside their households. He encouraged people to be “obsessed” with wearing masks properly and exercising hand hygiene, and social distancing “especially when eating and drinking”. “I am very concerned that we could lose control, yet we know by tightening our efforts we can defeat this surge together. This has to be a community effort,” he said. Prof Fisher’s comments in response to queries from CNA came amid a growing number of clusters in the community and unlinked cases. “RELATIVELY LARGER” CLUSTERS IN COMMUNITY As of Sunday (May 2), there were 27 COVID-19 cases linked to a cluster at the Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH), Singapore’s first hospital cluster. Other clusters include one linked to a cleaner who works at a community care facility in Tuas South, and one linked to an officer from the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority working at Changi Airport Terminal 1. Among the cases linked to the TTSH COVID-19 cluster are healthcare workers and elderly patients. MOHsaid on Saturday that an 88-year-old woman linked to the cluster died from complications related to COVID-19. As of Friday, TTSH put 76 staff members who had been in close contact with COVID-19 cases on leave of absence awaiting their quarantine orders based on further contact tracing, swabbing inpatients and staff members and locking down four wards. The Government also announced on Friday at a COVID-19 multi-ministry task force press conference that it will take action to try to reduce the transmission arising from the hospital cluster. Among the measures arelimits to the number of social interactions in a day, closing down public places visited by infected cases for two days for cleaning and casting a wide net in trying to discover more cases. Co-chair of the task force Education Minister Lawrence Wong said that this is the “first time in quite some time” that Singapore has seen “relatively larger clusters emerging in the community”. “Obviously, it is cause for concern, but we have also learned from experience that in order to control and break the transmission chains we must move in quickly,” he said. “We now have better tools to do this, we have testing capabilities we have a better tracing system.” DESPITE CONCERNS, SITUATION MANAGEABLE, RESPONSE REASSURING: EXPERTS Prof Fisher said that having a hospital cluster has been a “long-term concern”. “These have repeatedly happened in overseas hospitals so it’s actually to Singapore’s credit that this is the first such event,” he said. While infection prevention efforts are core in hospitals, “unfortunately they can never be 100 per cent”, he said. “The measures being undertaken should stop transmission. If all cases are isolated,all contacts are quarantined and even \\'low risk\\'contacts, sent home then any future positive cases should not have spread,” he said. Assistant Professor at the National University of Singapore’s Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health Hannah Clapham said that while the current increase in cases is concerning, “it is reassuring that we are seeing the rapid response to the current cases and a tightening of measures to try to control transmission”. “I am sure the situation will be monitored closely to assess whether further measures are required,” Dr Clapham said. Professor Paul Tambyah, president of the Asia Pacific Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infection, similarly said that the hospital outbreak is a “concern”, but said that quick measures have been put in place by the ministry and the hospital “so hopefully these will work”. The key is to understand how these clusters occurred, he said, pointing to “detailed molecular fingerprinting” as critical to doing this. “For the hospital cluster, the key has to be identifying the primary case and tracking where else this individual might have been in contact with others. This has implications for vaccine strategy and control efforts in general,” he said. He added that quality control at the labs is also very important to ensure that there were no false positive serological results earlier on and also at the vaccination centres to make sure that the cold chain was preserved. He said that the cases in vaccinated individuals are “a concern”. Some of the cases linked to the TTSH cluster have been vaccinated. Nevertheless, he said that the current situation is “manageable” given a few factors. “Firstly, the number are relatively small in the few clusters and most cases are linked. Secondly, we now have vaccines and thus we are much more able to contain outbreaks if we use strategies such as ring vaccination,” he said. Ring vaccination involves vaccinating contacts of people who test positive, creating a \"ring\" around each infected person. Such a strategy was used for smallpox in the past and mumps in recent years, Prof Tambyah said.SITUATION THEN AND NOW ARE DIFFERENT Dr Clapham and Professor Tambyah said that the difference in the situation now and the early stages of the pandemic is the availability of vaccines. Prof Tambyah said the difference between last year and this year is the “the presence of licensed vaccines”, adding that there are also better tests including antigen tests, polymerase chain reaction tests and serology tests. He said there is also a possibility of using preventive agents like antiseptic throat sprays. Dr Clapham also stressed the importance of people taking their vaccination when offered, as vaccines are a “huge advantage” now, compared to the early stages of the pandemic. “We have a better understanding of disease spread, which can help with refining control measures,” she added. COMPLYING WITH MEASURES IMPORTANT The doctors said the public should continue to take COVID-19 seriously. “If people are sick they should seek care and get tested, even with mild symptoms, in order to get care and stop transmission early,” Dr Clapham said. “We\\'re lucky in Singapore to have access to vaccines, and high uptake in vaccination will be an important step in future SARS-CoV-2 control,” she said. On Friday, director of medical services at MOH Associate Professor Kenneth Mak had also said at the press conference that authorities are concerned that “we may not be so vigilant, so disciplined” in the use of masks and safety measures. “There\\'s always the risk at we may become complacent,” he said urging people to be vigilant amid the tightening of measures. “I don’t think that the public should be overly worried, they should get vaccinated and practice good hygiene and see a doctor if not well. They also need to keep up to date with the information on hospital visitation and other guidelines,” Prof Tambyah said.

       " {'text': 'covid 19 tests dormitories worksites cluster cases westlite 14710028 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: Pre-emptive COVID-19 tests are being conducted in dormitories and worksites followinga new cluster of infections at Westlite Woodlands Dormitory. More than 5,500 workers were tested between Apr 23 and Apr 26, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said on Wednesday (Apr 28). The tests are in addition to the routine tests conducted on dormitory residents every two weeks, and include workers who have recovered from COVID-19and those who have never been infected. The move comes after 24 workers at Westlite dormitory who hadrecovered from COVID-19 tested positive for the disease again. Eleven of the cases were assessed to be shedding virus fragments of old infections and five were likely cases of re-infection, said MOM. Two cases were determined to be negative after re-testing and the remaining six are pending assessment. The Ministry of Health announced last week that recovered workers who have passed 270 days from their date of infection will also be subject to rostered routine testing, due to the risk of waning immunity and threat of new coronavirus variants. TESTING OF RECOVERED WORKERS When recovered workers are tested, the ministry said it expects a proportion of them to return a positive resultonpolymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests. However, this does not necessarily indicate re-infection among recovered workers. \"There could be two situations. One is that this person is a prolonged shedder, who is non-infectious and shedding dead viral fragments (which get picked up by) thePCR test,\" said DrLam Meng Chon, the director of the medical team atthe ministry\\'sAssurance, Care and Engagement(ACE) unit. In these cases, authorities would \"not be too worried\", he added. But the other situation is that the person may have been re-infected with a different strain, which could be transmissible to others. Dr Lam added: \"Because we are testing recovered workers, we have entered a new phase where a certain time is required for clinical assessments to determine if (patients are prolonged shedders or reinfected).\" These assessments typically require several days. \"So there\\'s no need to panic, but to be patient and allow the clinical assessment to take place,\" said Dr Lam. Movement restrictions or quarantines may also be imposed on a dormitory if a few workers there test positive for COVID-19, MOM said. This is a public health measure borne \"out of an abundance of caution\", to ensure that any cases and their close contacts can be quickly isolated, said DrLam. The ministry added that this precaution is necessary only for the duration of the assessmentand will be lifted when testshave concluded. “If quarantines are imposed in some dormitories, this does not necessarilymean that there are confirmed clusters there,” it said. “Most of the time, it is because cases are being assessed to determine if they are old or current infections.” DORMITORIES STEP UP SAFETY MEASURES, SUPPORT FOR WORKERS Precautionary steps have been taken in the dormitories to protect workers who are well andto stem the risk of transmission, MOM said. Workers can still access communal facilities and recreation centres in dormitories, with regulations in place to prevent residents from mingling.However, movement between dormitory blocks is not allowed and safe management measures have been stepped up. “Workers have also been advised to cease social interactions with others who do not reside in the same room or floor,” the ministry said. The Building and Construction Authority has also stepped up inspections on safe management measures at construction worksites. This includes conducting morechecks on workers\\'compliance withzoning, or increasedinspections at rest areas. The Manpower Ministryassured migrant workers that access to round-the-clock medical assistance remains available.Measures are also in place to look after their mental well-being, including counselling hotlines in their native languages. The ministry is also coordinating support from non-governmental organisations to provide calls and care packs to affected workers. “In addition to protecting their health and safety, these measures seek to assure our migrant worker that their livelihoods will be safeguarded,” MOM said. “Affected workers will continue to be paid their salaries for the duration of the quarantine, and their periods of absence from work will be treated as paid hospitalisation leave as part of workers’ leave eligibility under the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act.” Downloadourappor subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

The additional testing willapplyto all individuals with such symptoms who go toPublic Health Preparedness Clinics with the Swab and Send Home programme, polyclinics, emergency departments and regional swab centres. “While the ART is less accurate than the PCR test, and there will be more false positives and false negatives, the ART’s quicker turnaround time compared to a PCR test will allow us to take any public health actions more quickly for persons who test positive by ART,” said the Ministry of Health (MOH). Test results from ART teststake typically around 30 minutes, but it can take up to 48 hours for PCR tests, as the samples have to be sent to laboratories to be tested. Both the ART and PCR tests will be funded by the Government for all who present themselveswith ARI symptoms, said MOH. This comes amid a recent rise in COVID-19 cases within the community, with some unlinked cases, clusters at Changi Airport and Tan Tock Seng Hospital, as well as cases detected inschools. Mr Gan, who was speaking at the COVID-19 multi-ministry task force press conference,said that the ARTwill allow infections to be detected more quickly so that the authorities can startcontact tracing.Close contacts of infected cases can also be quarantined earlier. \"If there are false positive we can verify with PCR but in the meantime, once we have a positive result from reality, we can start the contact tracing and ring fencing and quarantine of close contacts that will allow us a head start in terms of our ring fencing of the infection,\" he said. He urged those with symptoms to come forward as soon as possible. \"Even if we are able to shorten the testing time, if the patients only present themselves to healthcare institutionsone or two days later, that negates the entire effort of trying to shorten the testing period,\" he said. However, as this type of testing isnot as accurateas PCR tests, both have to be done to ultimately confirm the infection, Mr Gan added. Director of medical services Kenneth Mak also said that MOH is working with the laboratories to expand their capacity in case Singapore needs to ramp up testing. \"We are also working to expand our quarantine facility capacity in order to be able to accommodate the potential and future demands associated with bringing all these clusters under control,\" he said. UPDATE ON VACCINATION In an update on Friday, MOH said Singapore has administered more than 3.2 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines. About 1.9 million individuals have received at least one dose of the vaccine. Among them, about 1.3 million have received their second dose. “The recent cases illustrate that vaccination may not eliminate the risks of infection completely. However, it provides significant protection against infections and helps to reduce the severity of the disease and onward transmission,” said MOH. It added that vaccination remains a “key enabler” and its ability to help Singapore reopen safely can only be felt when a high level of vaccinationcoverage in the population is achieved. “We urge everyone to be vaccinated when it is offered to you. Observe all safe management measures, see a doctor, and get tested if you feel unwell,” said the ministry. FACE SHIELDS MOH also updated its safe management advice to restrictthe use of face shields. It said that research has demonstrated that face shields cannot substitute masks in protecting the wearer from droplet infection, and \"do not adequately prevent\" prevent droplet spread if the wearer is infected. “Face shields should therefore not be used as a substitute for mask wear, except for medical exceptions; or where the child is 12 years or younger; or for the marriage couple during the solemnisation of their marriage,” it said.

       " {'text': 'food delivery retail e commerce booster packages covid 19 14820560 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: Food outlets and retailers affected by COVID-19 Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) restrictions will get help to offset their delivery costs and to go online with reintroduced government schemes. The food deliveryand e-commerce subsidy schemes werefirst introduced in April 2020 during Singapore\\'s \"circuit breaker\" period and removed as restrictions eased. They have been made available again tohelp businesses diversify their revenue channels and defray costs of going online, Enterprise Singapore said on Sunday (May 16), the first day the tightened rules kicked in. The support is available to businesses that are new to digital channels as well as those already selling via food delivery or e-commerce platforms, it added. FOOD DELIVERY BOOSTER PACKAGE From now untilJun 15, Enterprise Singapore will fund 5 percentage points of the commission cost charged by the three food delivery platforms - Deliveroo, foodpanda and GrabFood. In the same period, the agency will fund 20 per cent of the delivery costs for food delivery orders made through third-party logistic partners, such as Lalamove, Zeek Logistics and Pickupp. \"Collectively, these players serve a large majority of the food delivery market,\" said Enterprise Singapore. To be eligible for the Food Delivery Booster Package, F&B businesses must sell food that was prepared on-premises for immediate consumption. This includes smaller establishments like hawker stalls and cafes, and larger ones like food caterers and restaurants. F&B businesses already on any of the three food delivery platforms will automatically benefit from the lower commission cost. For the rest, they can approach the platforms to find out more. Prior to Enterprise Singapore\\'s announcement, Grab said it will provide full commission rebatesforstall owners operating in hawker centresmanaged by the National Environment Agency. For other food outlets, it will give a 50 per cent rebate on commissions for additional GrabFood orders as compared to their current level of sales or previous month\\'s sales. E-COMMERCE BOOSTER PACKAGE Retailers will receive a one-time 80 per cent support on qualifying costs for fees charged by e-commerce platforms, capped at S$8,000, until Nov 16. Enterprise Singapore said it has collaborated with Shopee and Qoo10 and may add new platforms in future. Shopee and Qoo10 will work with sellers to curate and list products for at least six months, participate in promotion campaigns, fulfil orders and perform basic data analytics of sales. Each retailer can apply with only one e-commerce platformwith whom it has no existing account. OTHER SUPPORT MEASURES Other support measures for businesses include those introduced earlier such as the Temporary Bridging Loan Programme to help companies access working capital. The programme has been extended to Sep 30. Schemes such as the Productivity Solutions Grant and Enterprise Development Grant, both of which help to lower the costs of digitalisation and other transformation efforts, have also been extended to Mar 31 next year. The Government has also increased support for F&B businessesunder the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) to 50 per centfrom the 10 per cent support of wages paid up to June 2021. Hawker stalls and coffee shop tenants of government agencies will also get a one-month rental relief. Singapore tightenedsafe distancing restrictionsfrom Sunday to Jun 13 to curb a recent increase in COVID-19 cases in the community. Group gatherings are capped at two and dining-in atfood outlets has been suspended, whileworking from home will again bethe default at workplaces. Enterprise Singapore assistant CEO Dilys Boey acknowledged that companies may have concerns about the additional resources required to deal with the tighter COVID-19 restrictions. \"We are providing support through the booster packages to help defray some of these operational costs. More importantly, we urge F&B and retail businesses who have yet to get onboard e-commerce to tap these packages to adapt their business models for online sales,\" said Ms Boey. \"For those already selling via food delivery or e-commerce platforms, we hope that this support can help them onboard additional platforms to widen their existing sales channels.” Downloadourappor subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

The six mosques are:Masjid Petempatan Melayu Sembawang in Sembawang, Masjid Abdul Hamid Kampung Pasiran in Novena,Masjid Hajjah Fatimah at Beach Road,Masjid Al-Falahin Orchard,Masjid Yusof Ishak in Woodlandsand Masjid Al-Iman in Bukit Panjang. Services at the mosques will resume on Friday. MUIS said this incident is a reminder of the need for continued vigilance amid the COVID-19 pandemic. “Our mosques already practise a comprehensive regime of cleaning and disinfection after every congregational prayer service every day,” MUIS said. “In addition, the temporary closure of mosques for deep cleaning is also an important precautionary measure, especially with the development of new strains of the COVID-19 virus. “These episodes are a reminder on the need to be vigilant to the spread of COVID-19, especially with the higher number of congregants at mosques during Ramadan, and the importance of TraceTogether to support the contact tracing efforts.” MUIS addedthat mosques in Singapore will takefurther steps to protect worshippers duringRamadan. “Our mosques will be stepping up vigilance, in terms of safe management as well as disinfection, in view of the increased intensity of activities during Ramadan,” the council said. “Our Ramadan service ambassadors and mosque staff and volunteers manning entry points will step up safe management procedures and remind congregants to minimise movement within the mosque. “Mosques will also increase the cleaning regimen around prayer zones after each prayer session.” MUIS added that it will continue to monitor the situation and make adjustments to mosque activities and safe management measures if required. The council also reminded congregants to follow its COVID-19 safety measures which include: Not visiting mosques if they are unwell; consistently praying at specific mosques to avoid transmission across multiple mosques, andkeeping their masks on at all times and avoiding interaction with other congregants. Worshippers are also encouraged tobringtheir own personal prayer itemsand performablution at home. Singapore reported 16 community cases among 35 new COVID-19 infections on Thursday.

       " {'text': '2700 reports suspected adverse effects covid 19 vaccination 14755780 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners More than 2,700 reports of suspected adverse events, which comprise common reactions like rash, muscle aches and dizziness, were received. SINGAPORE: More than 2,700reports on suspected adverse effects to COVID-19 vaccination were submitted to the authorities over a three-month period, the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) said on Thursday (May 6). These reports, which mostly documented common reactions like rash, muscle achesand dizziness, made up 0.13 per cent of the more than 2.2million administered doses from Dec 30 last year to Apr 18 this year. This \"makes the chance of having an adverse event very rare\", the HSA said at a press conference held to give an update on the safety of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines which have been approved for use here. Among the 2,796 reports are 95 cases which are classified asserious adverse effects. Thesemade up 0.004 per cent of the total number of administered doses. Reactions are deemed to be severe if they are life-threatening, patients are hospitalised or their functional capacity is significantly reduced. Most of the adverse effects are \"largely expected\" with COVID-19 vaccination, said theHSA. The majority - 70 per cent - of these cases were reported in patients younger than 60 years old but this is \"not unusual\", said the HSA, noting that the data is consistent with clinical trial reviews. The common side effects, which include fever, headache, muscle ache and shortness of breath are largely the physical manifestation of the body mounting an immune response, the HSA said. SERIOUS ADVERSE EFFECTS Of the 95 cases of serious adverse effects, 20 were reports of anaphylaxis, a rare and potentially life-threatening allergic reaction. The local incidence rate of anaphylaxis, 1.4 per 100,000 doses administered, is within the reported incidence rates of about 0.5 to 2in other countries, the authority said. Another 20 were of severe allergic reaction. A \"small number\" of reports were on patients who had effects such aslimb numbness and change in vision, the HSA said. Themajority of those who suffered from severe reactions have recovered or are recovering, it added. ADVERSE EVENTS OF SPECIAL INTEREST The HSA said it will also closely monitor the occurrence of adverse events of special interest. These are pre-specified medically significant events that have been \"observed historically with other vaccines\". Anaphylaxis and Bell\\'s Palsy are examples of such adverse events. Twenty-five cases of Bell\\'s Palsy, also known as peripheral facial nerve palsy, were reported, said the authority. Thisis a condition that causes temporary weakness or paralysis of the facial muscles. STROKES AND HEART ATTACKS The authority noted that a \"greater frequency of heart attacks and strokes has not been observed\" among the local vaccinated population. \"Strokes and heart attacks do occur naturally in people because of the various conditions. It could be underlying chronic conditions or sometimes it can happen spontaneously,\" the HSA said. It added that it has looked at the reports on such effects, but many times it might be “quite hard” to link the event to the vaccine. \"We have not found increase in incidence of strokes and heart attacks in our (vaccinated) patients when compared to baseline incidences,\" the HSA said. Explaining baseline incidences, the dean of the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health at the National University of Singapore Teo Yik Yingsaid that these are occurrences independent of having vaccination. Based on numbers over the past two years, there will be around 2,000 stroke cases in three months and slightly less than 3,000 heart attack cases in three months, he saidat the press conference. \"No deaths from heart attacks, strokes or any other causes suspected to be associated with the vaccines have been reported locally,\" said the HSA. Addressing breakthrough infections in the currently active Tan Tock Seng Hospital cluster, the Ministry of Health (MOH) noted that eight of the 40 cases had mild symptoms or were asymptomatic compared to those who were not vaccinated. “The benefits of the Moderna and the Pfizer vaccines continue to outweigh the risks in this current pandemic, especially in this current surge that we are experiencing right now,” MOH said, adding that the authorities will continue to monitor the safety profiles of the vaccines.

One of the cases is an eight-year-old boy from Fuchun Primary School who is linked to a previous case.He waslast in school on May 12 and was well, said MOE. According to the Ministry of Health (MOH), the boy isa family member and household contact of a software engineer at ST Engineering who tested positive on May 12. The boy was placed in quarantine on the same day. He was tested for COVID-19 on May 15 during quarantineand his infection was confirmed the next day. The second case is a 37-year-old teacher from Frontier Primary School. Her infection is currently unlinked to previous cases, said MOH. She was last in school on May 14 and was well, said MOE. Later that day shedeveloped a sore throat, body aches and a fever and was tested for COVID-19 at a clinic. Her test result came back positive on May 16. MOH said she has also tested \"preliminarily positive\" for the B1617 variantwhich was first detected in India. Both schools moved to home-based learning on Monday, two days ahead of schedule, to prevent the risk of any transmission, said MOE. It was announced on Sunday thatall primary and secondary schools, as well as junior colleges and Millennia Institute, will implement full home-based learning from Wednesday until the June holidays. It comes afterseveral primary school students tested positive for COVID-19 in recent days, with most of the infections linked to tuition centres. MOE said both schools have been thoroughly cleaned and disinfected. Close contacts of the confirmed cases have also been placed on quarantine orders, and will undergoCOVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) swab tests. Investigations and contact tracing by the Ministry of Health (MOH) are under way, added MOE. “MOE is in contact with the schools to provide the necessary support for teachers and students in conducting online learning. Teachers are also in contact with students and parents,” it added. A seven-year-old student from Maha Bodhi School has also tested positive for COVID-19. She was placed in quarantinefrom May 14 as she had attended the same external student care centre, Seedlings World Student Care @ Frankel, as an earlier confirmed case from St Stephen’s School. The St Stephen\\'s School studenthad attended classes run by an infected private tutor at Learning Point Tuition Centre inParkway Centre. The student from Maha Bodhi School was last in school on May 12 and was well, said MOE. She developed a fever on May 15 and was tested for COVID-19 on the same day. Her test result came back positive on May 16. \"As this is a linked case, where she had developed symptoms after being quarantined, MOH does not require contact tracing among school contacts,\" said MOE. The school will continue with physical lessons from May 17 to May 18, before starting full home-based learningon May 19, the Education Ministry added. \"MOE will continue to monitor the situation closely, and work with the school and parents to ensure the well-being of staff and students,\" said the Education Ministry. With the increase in the number of local cases, MOE urged all students and staff members to continue practising good personal hygiene and adhere to safe management measures.

       " {'text': 'losing temper lau pa sat covid 19 coronavirus mask wear mrt 14787258 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners Temperatures are rising as fresh public incidents show both people losing their cool and netizens losing their patience with those who may be flouting the law. A psychology lecturer from SUSS explains what’s behind it. SINGAPORE: COVID-19 has robbed us of our sense of control. We have had to adapt to changes forced upon us. From learning how to spend entire days with family to dealing with not seeing family and friends for entire months, to figuring out how to work from home and avoid working non-stop, work and life norms have swung from one pendulum to another. We also have had to deal with mental health challenges, in tackling Zoom fatigue to finding alone time in a house filled with people andlearning how to draw work-life boundaries and redefine rest. Then you step outside your house to find a new set of challenges await. This ranges from the logistical (how to take public transport while touching the least possible number of surfaces) to the behavioural (how to keep your distance from people). RECLAIMING CONTROL Psychologists know this desire to reclaim power over our situations is not new. We have taken actions to manage small incidents of stress in our everyday lives long before the advent of COVID-19. When Icome to a traffic light junction, I press the “green man” button. When I am in a hurry, I unconsciously press it more than once. If I am in a great hurry, I tap on it many times. I am not entirely sure if the button works. It is probably a placebo button. But pressing it makes me feel better about my waiting. It gives me a comforting sense of control. But we can’t control the uncle standing too close to us in a hawker centre queue. Neither can commuters on a MRT train control a 39-year-old maskless man who, in a viral video last weekend, was bent on debating strangers and sharing his personal research on the science of COVID-19 rather than mask up. The safe distancing ambassador at Lau Pa Sat might not have predicted how people can lose their cool when he confronted groups he suspected of flouting rules. Online, these two pieces of news have been met with swift condemnation and people calling for harsh punishments – fines, jail and even caning or deportation - to be meted out right away. It seems tempers are flaring all around. It looks like the email address you entered is not valid. Why are people reacting like that? Are we losing our grip? While the police investigate the cases that have come to light, wehope justice will be meted out to show violence and flagrant flouting of rules is not acceptable. THE SAME BOAT, THE SAME GROUP COVID-19 has imposed greater uncertainty over most parts of our lives. We have also lost control over our fate and our independent selves so it’s little wonder our tempers have grown short and our patience wearing thin. In order to exit the current COVID-19 measures, return to phase 3 and avoid personal illness, we need others (people, organisations and the Government) to cooperate and make the “right decisions”. This is our shared fate. Everyone in Singapore is now reluctantly in the same boat and in the same group. We are finding out we need the cooperation of others, including our neighbours, domestic helpers, and the general public around us whom we never had to rely on so critically before for our fate. The trouble is people enter COVID-19 with diverse values and tolerance levels. And this could explain why some react badly to being confronted. Our group isn’t from a Hollywood movie script. We are not going to win the basketball tournament or charge forward and overrun the enemy line as one united team. Our group has probably never been this tested on our social cohesion. We may have differences that span age, race, gender and even nationality, when members comprise those from the Merdeka generation aunties to working adults juggling work and family, to migrant workers. Our group also has what psychologists call low task cohesion: We don’t fully agree on what needs to be done and how they should be done. For example, some believe that we should close our borders, while some caution against it. And yet, our group is facing a big challenge in wanting everyone to conform to norms and rules to keep everyone safe. We depend on others to follow the new COVID-19 social norms of mask wearing, maintaining social distance, and avoiding large gatherings. Group members who commit indiscretions must know they are creating an unequal hierarchy, with themselves at the very top. With offences holding the potential of starting another wave of COVID-19 infections, offenders have unequal power over the fates of law abiding, norm-following members of the group. A similar rationale applies to netizens condemning these two incidents and calling for punishments to be meted out before justice has a chance to take its course. We need group members to reciprocate. We might think “I hate wearing a mask but I’ve worn one all day. Why can’t these people wear their masks properly too?” Proponents of harsher actions may see these offenders as group members who violate our social norms and do not match our sacrifices. (Are COVID-19 vaccines still effective against new variants? And could these increase the risk of reinfection? Experts explain why COVID-19 could become a “chronic problem\" on CNA\\'s Heart of the Matter podcast.) AGGRESSIVE CALLS CAN SPIN OUT OF CONTROL It is no surprise then to see more reports of aggressive reactions to COVID-19 restrictions on one hand, and calls for stiffer punishments for COVID-19 restriction violations on the other. People are desperate to reclaim personal control. And attempts to stop them, such as when they go out for a gathering of more than five at Lau Pau Sat, may be met with anger. “Who are you to ask me to listen to you?” shouted a man when his larger-than-five group is confronted by a safe distancing ambassador. Kudos to the ambassador who strove to keep his cool. Yet let’s not forget sentiments of intolerance can spin out of control quickly. We have witnessed the rise of anti-Asian hate crimes elsewhere in the world. In Singapore, our anger and frustration with COVID-19 and its outcomes and restrictions can easily morph into xenophobia and the formation of group identities based on adherence to rules. While not representative of all Singaporeans, social media comments related to foreigners seemingly violating COVID-19 restrictions or entering into Singapore from high-risks countries reveal a deep sense of anti-foreigner sentiments among some in our community. My research with 280 Singaporeans found that xenophobic fears related to COVID-19, evident through responses to questions such as “If I was in an elevator with a group of foreigners, I’d be worried that they’re infected with the virus”, is only second to danger and contamination fears about COVID-19, evident through responses to questions such as “I am worried that I can’t keep my family safe from the virus”. These two fears were higher among my Singaporean participants than fears about the socio-economic consequences of COVID-19. There is a story of how hot water changes things differently, revealing what one could be made of. In hot water, a hard potato softens, an egg is transformed but it’s the coffee bean that changes the hot water. COVID-19 is that hot water challenging our national character. It would be tragic if one legacy of COVID-19 is fear, discrimination against foreigners and knee-jerk reactions to cases of infractions.

Indian national Parthiban Balachandran pleaded guilty on Friday (May 14) to a charge each of exposing others to the risk of COVID-19 infection and leaving an isolation area without permission. Another two charges of exposing others to the risk of infection and of using insulting words towards a health officer will be considered in sentencing. The court heard that Parthiban stayed at Jurong Penjuru dormitory, which was among the dorms declaredin April 2020 to be an isolation area. On May 23 last year, Parthiban reported sick at the dorm, complaining of a fever and sore throat. Based on his symptoms and knowing that other dorm residents had reported positive for COVID-19, Parthiban suspected that he was infected with the virus. He was taken to the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) by ambulance where a swab test was taken from him. He was transferred to a fever-screeningarea in the hospital\\'s multi-storey car park, where staff nurses briefed him repeatedly in English and Tamil not to leave until his test results were ready, and not to go anywhere unless instructed. He was also told not to leave so that he would not risk infecting others if he did have COVID-19. Swab test results later showed he was a confirmed COVID-19 case. At about 5.30pm thesame day, Parthiban left the hospital without informing anyone, intending to go the airport to buy a ticket and return to India immediately. Closed-circuit television footage showed him leaving with two bags, walking towards Kim Tian Road and crossing an overhead bridge. He walked to Yong Siak Street, where he took a bus and later flagged a cab at Lower Delta Road. He took the taxi to Changi Airport Terminal 1, where he spoke to airport staff and tried to buy a ticket to India. He was not sold a ticket, and loitered at the airport for about four hours until the police found him and escorted him back to SGH. The taxi driver who took him to the airport was issued a quarantine order for 14 days and could not work during this time. He tested negative for the virus. Parthiban completed his period of isolation in the hospital on Jun 8 last yearand was diagnosed to be no longer infectious. He was sent back to the dormitory and ordered to serve another 14 days\\' leave of absence, and was not allowed to leave the dorm. HE LEFT THE DORMITORY FOR THE AIRPORT BEFORE TIME WAS UP AGAIN On Jun 16, before the period was up, Parthiban packed two bags of belongings and left the dorm. He intended to leave Singapore as he knew many dorm residents had tested positive for COVID-19. He took a cab to the airport but was told by airport staff that he could not buy a ticket. He loitered at the airport and slept there, before heading to a relative\\'s home in Tampines the next day. He told his relative that he had left the dorm without permission only after entering the flat. His relative called his employer and the police escorted him back to the dormitory. In a charge taken into consideration, Parthiban also used insulting words at a Ministry of Health officer at Harbourfront Centre on Oct 14 last year. When the officer read a charge to him, he said in Tamil: \"Who are you both to charge me? Are you a judge?\" Other things he said were: \"What rights do you have to charge me?\", \"Have you read law? Or do you have proper education to charge me?\". He also said to the officer: \"I have BABL (Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Law). Do you have a law degree in the first place? Do you want to see my degree?\" The prosecutor is asking for the maximum six months\\' jail for Parthiban. Defence lawyer Cory Wong of Invictus Law, who took the case on pro bono, asked the judge to remand Parthiban at the Institute of Mental Health for psychiatric observation. DEFENCE ASKS FOR PSYCHIATRIC OBSERVATION He tendered a Jun 8, 2020 memo from SGH indicating that Parthiban was suffering from adjustment disorder close to the time of the offences. He said Parthiban was on medication in April this year and was admitted to IMH last month. He said Parthiban was \"limited by his financial means\", explaining why no psychiatric report was obtained earlier. \"As far as we understand, the prosecution is asking for the maximum six-month jail term. Even with the COVID situation now ... we urge the court to exercise some caution and compassion, so we have all the relevant facts before we proceed with sentencing,\" said Mr Wong. He said the remand would be to assess if Parthiban had any mental condition at the time of the offences and if there was any link between this and the offences. The judge initially had reservations, saying the courts usually order IMH remand only at the charging or initial stages of cases. However, after considering further and after the prosecutor said he did not object, the judge ordered Parthiban to be remanded at IMH for psychiatric observation. Parties will return in June for further hearings. The maximum penalties for exposing others to the risk of infection are six months\\' jail, a S$10,000 fine, or both.

       " {'text': 'covid 19 ex magazine editor fined for attending 13 person 14831622 meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: A former magazine editor who was at a birthday party at Mediacorp actor Terence Cao\\'s home was fined S$3,000on Tuesday (May 18) for gathering with 12 other people during the pandemic. Lance Lim Chee Keong, 50, pleaded guilty to one charge of gathering with 12 people not from his household at Cao\\'s condominium in Daisy Road in October last year. The judge noted that Lim was a guest at the residence but went beyond by inviting more people to a gathering that was not necessary. She added that the vast majority of people in Singapore have made tremendous efforts and sacrifices to contain the spread of COVID-19, and that it is crucial for individuals to comply with measures so that the country can overcome the pandemic. At the time of the offence, Singapore was in Phase 2 of its reopening, with a limit of five visitors allowed for households. The court heard that Cao, 53, organised a social gathering at his home on Oct 2, 2020 to celebrate his birthday, as well as the birthdays of Shane Pow, 30, and 32-year-old Xu Mingjie, or Jeffrey Xu. Several of his local celebrity guests had turned up unannounced at Cao\\'s home to surprise him, but Lim had knowingly invited more people even though the number of guests had exceeded the legal limit. Initially, Cao invited Lim to his place along with artistes Pow, Xu, Benjamin Heng Tee Kok, 45, and Jeremy Chan Ming Yuew, 29. Cao, Lim and Pow had dinner at the condo unit between 7pm and 8pm on Oct 2, 2020. Lim invited artistes Sonia Chew, 30, and Julie Tan Shaoyin, 29, and marketing managers Debbie Lu Shuyi, 34, and Eleanor Wang Chunwei over, expecting them to arrive later. He asked Wang, 34, to bring a birthday cake to the gathering, and also knew that Wang had in turn invited artiste Dawn Yeoh Yishan, 34. THE GUESTS ARRIVE At about 8pm, part-time model and actress Valnice Yek Jia Hui arrived at the condo and Cao allowed the 22-year-old in. Pow had earlier invited her there without knowing that more guests were expected. Before 9pm, 30-year-old sales manager Tan Jun Chuan arrived at the home and Cao let him in. He had gone there to surprise Cao, and did not know that more guests would arrive later. Between 9pm and 10pm, Wang and Yeoh arrived at Cao\\'s home. They did not know that there were going to be more than five guests there, and were unaware that more guests would arrive later. There were now six guests in the unit. Between 10pm and 11pm, Lu arrived at Cao\\'s home to surprise him. Julie and Heng joined the group shortly. The trio did not know there were more than five guests there or that more would be arriving later. There were now nine guests at Cao\\'s home. Between 11pm on Oct 2, 2020 and 12am on Oct 3, 2020, Chew, Xu and Chan turned up at the house and were let in. They did not know there were going to be more than five guests there, and their arrival meant there were 12 guests in total. At about 11.30pm, all 13 participants of the gathering held a birthday cake-cutting ceremony and took group photos of everyone present. Xu posted one of the photos on his Instagram Stories page. Several of the guests left by 1am, leaving six behind. Lu left the condo as well between 1am and 2am on Oct 3, 2020. The remaining guests - Lim, Pow, Xu, Chew and Julie - left between 2am and 4am. Throughout the gathering, the guests chatted, ate and drank without wearing masks. They knew it was against the law to gather in a group of more than five people. HE WAS NONCHALANT: PROSECUTOR Deputy Public Prosecutor Norman Yew asked for a fine of at least S$3,000 to reflect the seriousness of his actions and \"to deter likeminded offenders who place their personal interests over the public\\'s health\". \"Lance Lim was nonchalant towards the laws enacted to protect Singapore against the global COVID-19 pandemic,\" said Mr Yew. \"His conduct belittles the efforts and sacrifices of the vast majority, who have, amongst many things, given up the pleasures of social interaction with family and friends for the public good to contain the spread of COVID-19.\" He said the courts should \"firmly denounce such behaviour and send a strong message that we need to continue to be vigilant and comply with measures to prevent another tidal wave of community infections\". Defence lawyers Josephus Tan and Cory Wong of Invictus Law asked instead for a fine of not more than S$2,500, saying that this was his first offence and an isolated one that was \"wholly out-of-character\" with \"no deep-seated criminality\". They said Lim was \"hard hit by the COVID-19 pandemic as he had lost his full-time job as a magazine editor back then\". He could not find any comparable employment for about a year and had to use his own savings to tide over. He has since secured work as a part-time editor to make ends meet after months of unemployment, they said. \"In a way, COVID-19 had indeed did Lance in twice over, the first being employment-wise and the second being offence-wise. He has learnt his lesson and he reiterates his genuine remorse,\" said the lawyers. Lim and Cao were charged in court in March, while the other 11 guests were each givenfines of S$300. The Building and Construction Authority had explained that they took into account the 11 guests\\' level of culpability in issuing them fines. An advisory was also issued to the management of Cao\\'s condominium to remind them to ensure compliance with safe management measures. Cao is expected back in court on May 25 to plead guilty. He is defended by lawyer S S Dhillon, who is also representing Pow for an unrelated drink driving charge. It looks like the email address you entered is not valid. Copyright© Mediacorp 2021.
