      "Additional measures for community activities in light of heightened alert to manage COVID transmission, and support for the sector This document provides a summary of measures that will impact community activities under MCCY sectors during Phase Two (Heightened Alert) from 16 May through 13 June 2021. 15 May 2021 The Multi-Ministry Task Force (MTF) have announced a further tightening of measures following the recent clusters of infections and an emerging pattern of local unlinked community cases. Effective from 16 May 2021 to 13 June 2021, this tightening will impact several sectors under the purview of MCCY, as well as groups and individuals working in these sectors. However, these tighter measures are necessary for Singapore to quickly contain the situation to prevent an escalation, and to protect the safety of our community. MCCY has put together support for these sectors to assist them to make the adjustments during this period. Summary of measures for MCCY sectors The key measures that will impact MCCY sectors are as follows: Live Performances All indoor and outdoor live performances should be deferred. Live performances which have been publicised before 5 May 2021 and which are scheduled to take place from 8 May through 13 Jun 2021 may only proceed with approval from MTI. From 16 May 2021, audiences will be capped at 100 persons with pre-event testing (PET), and up to 50 persons without PET. All performers must be properly masked at all times on stage. Singing or playing of instruments that require intentional expulsion of air (e.g. wind and brass instruments) will not be permitted at all times. Digital productions and associated rehearsals Recording of digital productions and their associated rehearsals are limited to 15 performers and crew on stage and backstage at any given time. This includes a maximum of 10 unmasked performers (of which no more than two persons can sing or play wind/brass instruments). Arts and cultural organisations must notify NAC of their plans before proceeding with their digital productions and associated rehearsals. Arts and culture classes, lectures, talks and workshops All speakers, participants and instructors in arts and culture classes, lectures, talks and workshops must be properly masked at all times. Activities that cannot be conducted with masks on must be suspended. There are to be no classes in singing or wind and brass instruments, even if masked. Face shields are not permitted substitutes for proper masks. The National Arts Council has released more details on the above: Museums Arts and heritage venues such as museums can continue operations, but at a reduced capacity of 25%. Tours within museum premises may be conducted for a maximum group size of 20 persons (excluding guide), with maximum of two persons allowed in any one sub-group, with all other prevailing safe management measures in place such as social distancing. The National Heritage Board has released more details on the above: Sporting activities Capacity limits for indoor and outdoor facilities have been amended to one person per 16sqm, or 50 persons, whichever is lower. This is to ensure there is even more space between people who are exercising, to minimise risk of transmission. a) Indoor facilities In line with the measure to cease all indoor “mask-off” activities, only non-strenuous activities can continue in all indoor sports venues, and participants must be masked at all times. Activities which will result in participants lowering their masks to catch a breath will not be permitted. As previously announced, no sharing of common equipment will be permitted indoors to reduce fomite transmission. b) Outdoor facilities and activities Outdoors, individuals engaging in strenuous exercises may do so in groups of up to two persons (including any instructor), keeping 2m distance between individuals. They can be unmasked when exerting but should put on their masks thereafter. c) Indoor and Outdoor large group classes Indoor and outdoor group classes are capped at 30 persons (including the instructor) or the venue capacity cap, whichever is lower. All individuals must remain masked at all times. All instructors and participants must be masked at all times. Class participants must be in groups of no more than two, with 2m between individuals, and 3m between groups. Outdoor classes for strenuous activities which require participants to be unmasked, will be capped at two persons including the instructor. Sport Singapore (SportSG) has released more details on the above: Congregational and other worship services Congregational and other worship services will be limited to 100 persons with PET, or up to 50 persons at a time without PET. This is subject to safe management measures and the venue capacity limits of the premises. Religious workers support these services should be kept to a minimum. Worshippers can participate in worship services in groups of no more than two persons. Masks must be worn at all times by all persons including when speaking during congregational and other worship services. Face shields are not permitted substitutes for proper face masks. To reduce the risk of transmission, singing and the playing of wind/brass instruments will not be allowed. There should also be no sharing of prayer or common items. Other religious activities Religious Organisations (ROs) may continue to use places of worship to conduct religious rites, in groups of no more than two persons. All other religious activities (e.g. religious classes for adults and children) will be suspended. Digital productions and associated rehearsals Recording of digital productions at the place of worship are limited to 15 performers and crew on stage and backstage at any given time. This includes a maximum of 10 unmasked performers (of which no more than two persons can sing or play wind/brass instruments). ROs must notify MCCY of their plans before proceeding with their digital productions. Wedding solemnisations and Funeral rites Wedding solemnisations may continue, with up to 100 persons with PET, or up to 50 persons without PET, subject to venue capacity limits. The cap of 100 and 50 persons respectively, exclude the solemnizer and religious and supporting workers, whose numbers should be kept to a minimum. In line with curbs on dine-in F&B establishments, wedding receptions will not be allowed. Funerals, wakes, burial/cremations, installation of niches and post-funeral rites at places of worship can involve not more than 20 attendees at any time, subject to venue capacity limits. Attendees should be organised in groups of no more than two persons. The cap of 20 excludes religious and supporting workers, whose numbers should be kept to a minimum. Attendees are to maintain safe distancing and be masked at all times to reduce the risk of transmission. More details have been released separately: Support for MCCY sectors MCCY and our agencies have been focused on providing support to groups, businesses, and individuals within our sectors to manage the disruptions resulting from COVID-19, and to help them emerge stronger. Both the Arts and Culture Resilience Package and the Sports Resilience Package have been dedicated to tide our sectors throughout the pandemic. Arts & Culture The Arts and Culture Resilience Package has been topped up over the past year to the current $75M. This funds operating grants, venue hire subsidies, assistance to SEPs and assistance to support the transformation of businesses. In addition, MCCY will provide further support for arts and culture self-employed persons (SEPs) affected by the latest tightened measures. We will also subsidise the costs of PET for arts and culture companies presenting permitted live performances from 16 May – 13 June 2021. This will enable larger audiences to attend live performances in this period safely, cushioning the financial impact to arts companies caused by these tightened measures. NAC will release more information on how SEPs and groups presenting live performances can apply for the additional support. Sports SportSG recently announced relief measures for businesses and SEPs affected by the measures announced on 8 May for the period up to 30 May 2021. This includes project grants, operating grants, training assistance grants, and direct cash assistance. This will continue to be available, to help affected businesses defray the costs of overheads. We will extend the support to cover the heightened alert period up to 13 June 2021. SportSG is looking into the provision of more outdoor spaces within its ActiveSG facilities for coaches and instructors to conduct their classes. The mechanism to apply for these spaces will be announced to the community when ready. Details will be communicated by the respective agencies when ready. Keeping our community safe It is critical that our people, businesses, and government work together to bring down the number of COVID-19 cases, to keep our community safe. MCCY understands that the tightened measures are disruptive to our sectors and have developed support packages to help our stakeholders make the necessary adjustments. MCCY very much appreciates our religious organisations, as well as our arts, culture, and sports businesses and communities for rallying together to implement the safe management measures. Together, we will emerge safe, and stronger. Issued by: Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth\n",
      "Advisory to dormitory operators - Additional measures in line with Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) Issued on 17 May 2021 Additional Measures in line with Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) To better protect our migrant workers (MWs) living in dormitories from being exposed to COVID-19 in the community, the Ministry of Manpower will implement additional measures for them from 17 May 2021. These measures are in response to the community measures introduced on 14 May for Phase 2 (Heightened Alert). It is important that dormitory operators continue to ensure good Safe Living Measures (SLM) are practised in the dormitories. Suspension of Safe Rest Day Visits to Recreation Centres Visits to the Recreation Centres for Safe Rest Days will be suspended temporarily until further notice. We are currently exploring arrangements to allow visits to Recreation Centres in a safe and controlled manner during this Phase of heightened alert and will update in due course. This measure is to mitigate the risk of them being exposed to possible infection and subsequently infecting others in their dormitories. MWs will still be allowed to carry out essential errands, including reporting sick if they are unwell. MWs who are found to have acted irresponsibly may face further actions such as having their work passes revoked. Use of Communal Dormitory Facilities In line with the national measures during this period, all the gyms, beer gardens and communal dining facilities within the dormitories will need to be closed, and canteens can only offer takeaway services (i.e. no dining in). MOM will step up enforcement on the compliance to Safe Management Measures during this period. Ensure that all activities within your dormitories are to be capped at the permissible group size of up to two persons. You should remind your residents to continue to adhere to the appropriate Safe Management Measures within your dormitories. No Change to Work, RRT and Vaccination Appointments There will be no changes to the work arrangements for your residents. They will be able to continue to go to work if they have a green AccessCode. Employers have been reminded to continue to arrange dedicated transport arrangements for your residents, at staggered pick-up and drop-off timings to and from the worksites. Your residents will also be allowed to leave their dormitories to attend their Rostered Routine Testing (RRT) and vaccination appointments. Dormitory operators are required to ensure that your residents adhere to their assigned groupings, to restrict intermixing. Responsibilities as dormitory operators Ensure that Safe Living Measures are enforced and adhered to, including, but not limited to the following measures: Good layer segregation with residential floors or layers, to restrict intermixing. Consistent cleaning and disinfection of high-touch surfaces and communal areas. Staggered pick-up and drop off timings, especially during peak hours. Remind your residents not to go to work if they feel unwell and seek medical care. Inform your residents to comply with the Infection Prevention Control (IPC) Measures, including: DosDon’ts Wear a mask correctly, covering nose and mouth at all times. Maintain good personal hygiene, including washing their hands with soap and water frequently. Use hand sanitizers after coming into contact with high touch areas, such as ATMs. Maintain 1 metre safe distance. Seek medical help if they are feeling unwell, via telemedicine on FWMOMCareApp. Inform the dormitory operator or employer to provide a dedicated transport to the regional medical centre. For emergencies, call 995. Do not intermix with other MWs working in different zones at your worksite or residing in other floors or layers in the dormitories. Do not go to work when unwell. Employers are responsible for the upkeep and maintenance of your residents’ well-being. You should continue to work with employers and make the necessary arrangements to ensure that your residents are given proper food during this period. Dorms with mini-mart operations should prepare to support MWs by ensuring sufficient stock of daily essentials during this period. Mini-marts should not take advantage and increase prices. If your residents need access to physical remittance services, inform the Forward Assurance and Support Team (FAST) so that they can assess how best to facilitate this for your residents. As this may be a difficult period for your residents, we encourage that you continue to engage your residents to provide them with emotional and mental support. You may refer to Annex A for more information on the support you can provide to your residents.

      "1 UPDATED AS OF 15 MAY 2021 FAQS FOR MANAGEMENT CORPORATIONS (MCSTs) AND MANAGING AGENTS (MAs) Convening of Annual General Meeting (AGM) Q1. When should a MCST hold the next annual general meeting? A1. Under section 27(1) of the Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act (BMSMA), a MCST shall hold the second or subsequent annual general meeting (AGM) in each calendar year and not more than 15 months from the last preceding AGM. * Under Section 26(1) of BMSMA, the owner developer shall hold the first AGM of MCST latest by the 13th month from the date of constitution of MCST. Q2. Can MCSTs conduct AGMs via electronic means? A2. MCSTs may do so. Please refer to the circular and guidance notes, dated 7 April 2021, issued by BCA at Q3. What must a subsidiary proprietor (SP) do if he/she wishes to stand for election of council member in a general meeting conducted via electronic means? A3. If an SP wishes to be nominated to stand for the election of council member, we encourage him/her to send his/her name by writing or email to the Secretary of MCST at least 48 hours before the start of the meeting. Alternatively, he/she may attend the general meeting via electronic means and inform the Chairperson of the meeting of the intention to be nominated for election of council member. Q4. How does an MCST go about arranging for an AGM conducted by electronic means? Will BCA recommend any vendor for this purpose? A4. The MCST should refer to the circular and guidance notes, dated 7 April 2021, issued by BCA ( The MCST should also engage or appoint a vendor who can provide the services of conducting the AGM via electronic means, which can meet the requirements set in the guidance note. BCA does not recommend or restrict the type or group of vendors whom MCSTs can engage or appoint for this purpose.2 Q5. Can an MCST hold a physical AGM? A5. An MCST can hold a physical AGM with no more than 50 persons attending the meeting in person together, or such number of persons who can be accommodated at the venue where there is at least one metre safe distancing between any two individuals, whichever is lower. MCSTs conducting physical AGMs must comply with the relevant Safe Management Measures (SMMs) as laid out in the circular and guidance notes, dated 7 April 2021, issued by BCA ( Depending on the venue size, the attendance cap could be lower than 50 persons in order to comply with the SMMs. For AGMs expecting to have an attendance that exceeds 50 persons or the number of persons that can be accommodated at the venue in compliance with the SMMs, MCSTs are advised to conduct the meetings by electronic means. Attendees must maintain at least 1 metre safe distancing between other attendees at all times during the AGM. Attendees must wear masks at all times during the AGM. Attendees must minimise socialising among one another at all times during the AGM. Socialising before or after the AGM should also be discouraged. Q6. If MCST expects an attendance of more than 50 persons, can MCST conduct the AGM via both electronic means and physical meeting? A6. For AGMs expecting to have an attendance that exceeds 50 persons or the number of persons that can be accommodated at the venue in compliance with the safe management measures, MCSTs are advised to conduct the meetings by electronic means. Please refer to A4. MCST should take note of the real risk that more than 50 attendees will turn up at the physical location. When such situation arises, the MCST will be faced with the quandary of allowing more than 50 attendees in the meeting and breaching the 50 pax cap in the Control Order. The MCST may also find it difficult to handle a crowd larger than it had anticipated, and may have difficulties adhering to the safe management measures (such as at least 1 metre distancing between 2 individuals, due to the area of the meeting location). Further, if the MCST has to turn away attendees, the MCST may breach the rights of the attendees, who are subsidiary proprietors (“SPs”), to participate in the meeting. This will expose the MCST to possible challenges by the SPs that the proceedings of the general meeting are not proper or that the SPs are denied the right to vote at the meeting. Q7. Besides AGM, can an MCST or management Council hold any other types of meetings in person?3 A7. The MCST can hold physical extraordinary general meetings, with no more than 50 persons attending the meeting in person, or such number of persons who can be accommodated at the venue where there is at least one metre safe distancing between any two individuals, whichever is lower. This arrangement can also apply to physical council meetings held by management councils. MCSTs and management councils conducting physical meetings must comply with the relevant Safe Management Measures (SMMs), including SMMs in the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations. For more information, you may wish to refer to the circular and guidance notes, dated 7 April 2021, issued by BCA ( For meetings expecting to have an attendance that exceeds 50 persons or the number of persons that can be accommodated at the venue in compliance with the SMMs, MCSTs are advised to conduct the meetings by electronic means. Safe Management Measures [For the Period of 16 May to 13 June 2021 – both dates inclusive] Q8. Can MCST continue to allow indoor sports facilities to be opened? A8. All indoor gymnasiums and indoor fitness studios are to be closed till 13 June 2021, unless low intensity physical activities, sports and exercises are conducted , where all participants and instructors are wearing masks at all times, and where there is no sharing of any common equipment. These are activities that can be done with mask on at all times such as Yoga, Pilates, stretching exercises, Tai Chi, etc. There may have to be some modification to how it is done, e.g. without the use of equipment, during this period of time. Participants, instructors and staff also have to adhere to a more stringent set of safe management measures (SMMs). No facilities will be allowed to offer weight, strength or resistance training of any form, and/or provide equipment for such training, as these are associated with strenuous activities. Other indoor facilities similar to gym and studio settings that remain in operation are to modify their activities to be in line with the more stringent SMM. For indoor sports facilities such as sports hall, swimming pool and squash court are to be closed till 13 June 2021, unless low intensity physical activities, sports and exercises are conducted , where all participants and instructors are wearing masks at all times, and where there is no sharing of any common equipment. For other indoor sports such as basketball, badminton, table tennis and volleyball playing indoors, these activities have to be changed to low intensity with masks on in a group of no more than 2 persons (i.e. 1v1). While practice drills may still be possible, competitive sports will typically be high intensity and if allowed to proceed would put participants at risk of flouting the law. Therefore, we advise MCSTs to ensure that competitive sports do not take place and masks are worn at all times. MCSTs need to ensure that the residents using these facilities observe and comply with the safe management measures (SMMs) as laid out in the circular and guidance notes, dated 4 14 May 2021, issued by Sports SG. MCSTs can refer to the latest SMM advisory issued by Sports SG at Q9. How should the MCST compute the maximum number of persons who can use a sports facility at any one time? A9 Sports facilities (e.g. hard courts, swimming pools) should have capacity limits to avoid crowdedness and minimise the risk of large clusters forming. Refer to table below. Q10. The development has 3 separate swimming pools. Can the MCST aggregate or add up the areas of the 3 swimming pools to compute the maximum number of persons who can use the swimming pools? A10. No. The maximum number of persons who can use each swimming pool shall be computed from the usable area of each individual swimming pool. Q11. How is the usable area defined for a) swimming pool, b) other water-based facilities, c) other associated features (e.g. sauna), and d) hard courts? A11. For a) swimming pool and b) other water-based facilities, the usable area of the facility refers to its Plan Area and cut-off at the edge of the drain/edge of the wall of the facility, whichever is smaller. For c) other associated features, the usable area refers to the Plan Area of the facility, excluding shower/washing facilities like changing/shower room. For d) hard courts, the usable area of the facility refers to its Plan Area and cuts off at the fence/wall of the facility. Q12. The swimming pool is not of regular shape. How does the MCST determine the area? Usable Area of the Facility Maximum Capacity More than 50 square metres Should be limited to 1 person per 16 square metres of usable area or 50 persons, whichever is lower. Each group should be 3 metres apart and each person in the group should be 2 metres apart Smaller than 50 square metres Should be limited to 2 persons.5 A12. The MCST can refer to the building plan of the development for the Plan Area of the swimming pool. Alternatively, the MCST can draw the best possible approximation of a regular shape within the outline of the pool to facilitate calculation. In the example below, the dotted rectangle can be used to calculate the area of the pool (indicated in blue outline). Example Q13. The common swimming pool is linked or connected to the private pool of each housing unit (e.g. for units on the ground floor). When the MCST computes the maximum number of persons who can use the common swimming pool, should the area of the private pools be included? A13. No. The MCST should not include the area of the private pools as part of the area of the common pool to compute the maximum number of persons who can use the common swimming pool. Q14. Can individuals from different households use a facility together? A14. Individuals from different households can use a facility together. In general, the individuals should maintain a safe distance of at least 1 metre when using any facility. If a 1 metre safe distancing between individuals is not feasible or practical, it can be applied between groups of up to 2 persons, but there should be no mixing or interaction between groups which are using the same facility. Please see the illustration below. If the activities involve exercising or playing of sports, then a longer safe distance of 2~3 metres should be maintained. Q15. What are the common facilities that should be closed? >1m >1m6 A15. All outdoor barbeque pits must be closed till 13 June 2021. Q16. If the development has a large function room or event facility, can the MCST allow more than 2 persons to use the room/facility? A16. Any gathering conducted in the function rooms or event facilities, except for the holding of solemnisations, receptions, wakes/funerals, and post-funeral religious rites, shall be kept to a maximum of 2 persons, regardless of the size of the room. Q17. What are the requirements for holding solemnisations, receptions, and wakes/funerals in the common property within condominiums? A17. For marriage solemnisations, Marriage solemnisations may continue for up to 100 participants with pre-event testing (PET) and 50 participants without PET* under “Marriage Solemnisations and Receptions” at and FAQs at for further information. No wedding reception is allowed till 13 June 2021. For wakes and funerals, up to 20 persons (excluding funeral workers and vendors) will be allowed at any one time on all days. MCSTs can refer to the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations 2020 and the NEA’s guidelines ( for the full list of SMMs applicable. The number of attendees for the events is subject to the individual venue’s capacity limit based on safe management principles. MCSTs may also set additional conditions for the use of their facilities, such as a lower limit for attendance based on their capacity or ability to ensure that SMMs are implemented. Q18. What are the requirements for holding post-funeral religious rites in the common property within condominiums? A18. The number of attendees at the event should generally be kept to 20 persons or fewer at any time. This excludes any religious workers, which should be kept to a minimum. MCSTs can refer to the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations 2020 for the full list of SMMs applicable. Q19. Can MCSTs choose not to allow the holding of solemnisations, receptions, wakes/funerals or post-funeral religious rites in the common property within condominiums?7 A19. MCSTs have a duty to control, manage and administer the common property for the benefit of all subsidiary proprietors in the development, in accordance with the applicable by-laws (including prescribed by-law 18(2) in the Second Schedule to the Building Maintenance (Strata Management) Regulations). Therefore, MCSTs should assess and determine their capacity and ability to put in place the necessary SMMs for the respective event/activity, and may set additional conditions for the use of their premises. Otherwise, MCSTs can choose to disallow these events/activities within the development. As a good practice, MCSTs are encouraged to inform residents, for instance, through a circular or notice, should MCSTs decide to disallow these events/activities. Q20. Do MCST and security guards have the power to enforce if residents report non-compliances to safe distancing measures or safe management measures? A20. MCST and security guards should step up patrol of the common areas and ensure that residents observe the safe distancing measures implemented by the Government to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission. Residents can alert the security guards or MCST of any evidence of non-compliances to social distancing measures. Where necessary, the MCST can escalate the report to BCA at with detailed information (e.g. location, date and time, and photographic evidence). Q21. Some residents are not following guidelines to maintain safe distancing or are having large gathering at common areas or at their homes, what can we do? A21. Social gatherings of 2 persons in each group outside their homes are allowed under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations 2020 to combat the coronavirus outbreak. Further, each household may only receive up to 2 unique visitors per day. Failure to comply with all relevant requirements is an offence, and BCA will not hesitate to take enforcement action against errant parties. Any non-compliance to the safe management measures should be reported to your MCST or Managing Agents (MAs) immediately.

      "1 Issued: 14 May 2021 Updated: 18 May 2021 Issued: 14 May 2021 Updated: 18 May 2021 FURTHER STRICTER SAFE MANAGEMENT MEASURES FOR SPORT AND PHYSICAL EXERCISE & ACTIVITY (16 May to 13 June 2021) 1. On 14 May 2021, the Multi-Ministry Taskforce announced that with effect from 16 May to 13 June 2021, there will be further tightening of safe management measures to curb the transmission of COVID-19 within the community. To reduce risks of community transmission, indoor “mask-off” activities will cease during this period. The current permissible group size of up to 5 persons will also be reduced to no more than 2 persons. 2. Following that announcement, Sport Singapore is providing an updated guidance on the stricter set of measures that concerns all sports, physical exercises & activities, and public & private sports & recreational facilities in Singapore for the period of 16 May to 13 June 2021. These measures are directed towards reducing or containing community spread of COVID-19 by stopping sport and physical activities that take place in high-risk environments. In general, high-risk environments are enclosed, indoor spaces (fully enclosed on all sides), where participants are likely to engage in strenuous activities unmasked. As a result, no strenuous physical activities should take place in any indoor spaces regardless of size (including Indoor Sports Halls and atriums in shopping malls). There are also further restrictions on density and group size as well as outdoor and indoor exercise classes. 3. The updated measures described in this guidance have to be adhered to starting 16 May 2021 and ending at the end of 13 June 2021 and supersedes the guidance issued on 7 May 2021. Additionally, this guidance has been updated on 18 May 2021 to include paragraph 3A & 3B on the measures introduced to safeguard the well-being of children and youths 1 . SUSPENSION OF SPORT / PHYSICAL ACTIVITY CLASSES / PROGRAMMES FOR 18 YEARS & BELOW, FROM 19 MAY 3A. Aligning to the Ministry of Education’s announcements on 16 and 18 May 2021 to reduce the intermingling of students from different schools and enhance the safety of students, all indoor sport / physical activity classes / programmes regardless of class size that cater to individuals who are 18 years (born in 2003) and below, are to be suspended or moved online. This takes effect from 19 May to 13 June 2021 or till further notice. 3B. Outdoor sport / physical activity for this age group1 shall be restricted to only 1 coach to 1 student/trainee. If activity is strenuous, mask can be taken off but have to be put on immediately after the end of the activity. No group outdoor classes / programmes can be conducted for this age group during the stipulated period. FURTHER REDUCTION OF GROUP SIZE FOR SPORT & PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES 4. The following conditions shall apply to all sport and physical exercises & activities, and sport & recreational facilities from 16 May to 13 June 2021: 1 Refers to 18 years (born in 2003) and below 2 Issued: 14 May 2021 Updated: 18 May 2021 a. Sport/recreational facilities can only admit a maximum number of persons according to its Gross Floor Area based on 16 Sqm per person2 , up to a maximum of 50 persons, instead of 10 Sqm per person. No facility, regardless of size, shall admit more than 50 persons. b. Group activities must be confined to no more than 2 individuals. The physical distancing3 between individuals and groups of up to 2 individuals must be maintained while exercising and playing sport. i. For organised programmes and classes that take place indoors, an additional service provider (such as an instructor or a coach) from a permitted enterprise may guide the group. Multiple groups of 2 remain allowable up to 30 participants or the capacity limit of the venue, whichever is lower. The groups of 2 are not to intermingle before, during and after the class, and must remain 3 metres apart. Refer to subsequent paragraphs on restricting all indoor activities to low intensity activities with masks on at all times. ii. For organised programmes and classes that take place outdoors, an additional service provider (such as an instructor or a coach) from a permitted enterprise may guide the group. Multiple groups of 2 remain allowable up to 30 participants or the capacity limit of the venue, whichever is lower, if the activity is of low intensity with masks on at all times. The groups of 2 are not to intermingle before, during, and after the class, and must remain 3 metres apart. If the activity is of high intensity where masks have to be removed, including for swimming, only two persons are allowed (including instructor or coach) and there can be no multiple groups of 2. iii. Physical activity of a social nature should be kept to 2 participants. c. Large complexes or multi-function premises such as country clubs may treat different parts of their premises as separate facilities, provided that they are well separated by physical barriers such that intermingling is not possible. LOW INTENSITY SPORT & PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES IN INDOOR ENVIRONMENTS 5. Physical activities, sport and exercise environments that are indoors 4 , where participants are in close contact, exerting and are not reasonably expected to be wearing masks, will not be allowed. a. All indoor facilities may only allow low intensity sport and physical activities with masks on at all times. Indoor high risk environments, i.e. indoor public and private gyms and fitness/exercise/dance studios5 , including those operated by 2 The Gross Floor Area includes exercises spaces, as well as other spaces such as changing rooms, rest areas within the facility. Facilities up to 32 sqm can admit up to 2 persons; this does not include staff. 3 A 2-metre physical distancing between individuals should be maintained while exercising and playing sport. If there is more than one group sharing a space, the groups must not interact and must maintain a distance of 3 metres apart from one another at all times. 4 Defined as premises which are fully enclosed on all sides. 5 Premises identified as high-risk physical activities, sport and exercise environments include, but are not limited to, indoor fitness training facilities, indoor gyms, as well as fitness studios and similar indoor studio settings for climb walls, trampoline, dance, barre, spin, etc. Such indoor premises (and including any other type of indoor premises such as hotel, club or condominium function rooms) must not be allowed to be used, or hired out to others for use for any high intensity sport and physical activities where participants are in close contact, exerting and not wearing masks during the stipulated period. 3 Issued: 14 May 2021 Updated: 18 May 2021 commercial enterprises, country clubs, golf clubs, private apartments, condominiums and charities, are to close during the stipulated period, unless they only offer low intensity physical activities, sport and exercises where all participants and instructors are wearing masks at all times b. No such facility will be allowed to offer weight, strength or resistance training of any form, and/or provide equipment for such training, as these are associated with strenuous activities. c. Participants, instructors and staff of these facilities also have to adhere to a more stringent set of safe management measures (SMMs) per Annex. d. Premises may be used by a coach/instructor for the purposes of producing digital content for online classes. Sport Singapore will have to be notified beforehand at Sport_Covid@sport.gov.sg to confirm adherence to prevailing SMMs for digital content production. There shall be no other activities at the premises when digital content production is taking place. 6. For a list of affected Sport Singapore’s indoor facilities and programmes during this period, please visit Refunds for affected bookings that fall under these dates will be processed within the next seven working days. LARGE GROUP OUTDOOR CLASSES 7. Approved large outdoor classes at public spaces such as parks and HDB common areas, can continue, subject to the venue size and safe distancing requirements as stated in paragraph 4(b)ii. All instructors must also be registered with Sport Singapore.6 8. Sport Singapore is looking into the provision of more outdoor spaces within its ActiveSG facilities for coaches and instructors to conduct their classes. The mechanism to apply for these spaces will be announced to the community when ready. OTHER SAFE MANAGEMENT MEASURES 9. Other safe management measures will continue to be in place. These include, but are not limited to: a. Mask wearing. Masks should be worn as a default. If an individual is engaged in an outdoor activity of high intensity by himself or with another person (i.e. no more than 2 in the group), masks may be removed for the activity. Maintain social distancing from other groups. Those performing permitted low intensity sport and physical activity in an indoor environment are required to wear a mask at all times. The activity has to cease immediately, if any participant removes his or her mask, even for a short while to breathe. 6 Instructors who are interested to conduct large outdoor classes at outdoor public spaces must be registered and can do so via Subsequent approval from facility owner need to be sought before activities can be conducted. 4 Issued: 14 May 2021 Updated: 18 May 2021 b. Sharing of common equipment should be avoided. Participants in an indoor environment should not share sport and exercise equipment, such as exercise machines, bars, free weights, stationary bikes, treadmills, exercise mats where fomite transmission risk is high. No premises that remain open is to provide such equipment for use. c. Reducing Physical Interaction & Hygiene and Ensuring Safe Distancing. Owners or operators of facilities are responsible for ensuring safe management measures are implemented, and that their patrons/users comply. Facility owners/operators will have to: i. Organise human traffic flow and space management to ensure that the mixing of groups is minimised to transient contact; ii. Put in place measures to minimise crowding or mixing at common facilities e.g. toilets. Where possible, specific common facilities should be designated to specific zones so that attendees from different zones do not mix when using such facilities; iii. Conduct temperature screening7 and checks on visible symptoms8 for visitors, and turn away those with fever and/or who appear unwell. SafeEntry must be implemented for participants and visitors. From 17 May 2021 onwards, all participants and staff are to use either the TraceTogether app or the TraceTogether Tokens for SafeEntry; iv. Frequently disinfect common spaces and interactive components (e.g. smart kiosks, turnstiles). Operators are strongly encouraged to adopt good sanitation and hygiene practices to achieve the SG Clean quality mark; v. Place hand sanitisers in close proximity of the facility entrance and high-touch surfaces like door handles. Attendees should be encouraged to sanitise their hands before entering and upon leaving the facility; vi. Ensure that participants do not shout while engaging in physical activities. This is because shouting increases the risk of transmission via droplets. Coaches/instructors may raise their volume when communicating instructions or in the event of a potential danger. SPORT EVENTS FROM 8 MAY TO 13 JUNE 2021 10. As part of ongoing efforts to reduce the community spread, Sport Singapore will maintain the tightening on sport events during the stipulated period: a. Mass participation sport events will not be permitted to take place. Organisers are to work with Sport Singapore to cancel or postpone the events to a later date. b. All other sport events, including live spectator sport events, sport competitions and tournaments, will be subject to approval before they can proceed. There will be no spectators allowed at sport events and competitions. National Sports Associations 7 Individuals with temperatures 38 degrees celsius and above are considered as having a fever. 8 Notable visible symptoms to look out for include: (a) coughing; (b) sneezing; (c) breathlessness; and (d) a runny nose. 5 Issued: 14 May 2021 Updated: 18 May 2021 that are organising competitions and tournaments related to qualifications for international competitions for national athletes, should approach Sport Singapore early to discuss their plans. The above applies to all sport events, including those that have previously been endorsed by Sport Singapore. ENFORCEMENT 11. Government agencies will be conducting inspections. Enforcement action(s) under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act and the Infectious Diseases Act will be taken against businesses or individuals who fail to comply with safe management measures. EVERYONE HAS A PART TO PLAY AGAINST COVID-19 12. Singaporeans are urged to remain vigilant and observe safe distancing measures in place to minimise community transmissions. We all have a part to play in keeping COVID-19 at bay, and protect ourselves and our loved ones. 13.

      "Phase Two (Heightened Alert) - Tighter measures for religious activities This document provides the conditions under which religious organisations (ROs) are permitted to carry out activities in places of worship during Phase Two (Heightened Alert) from 16 May through 13 June 2021. 15 May 2021 On 14 May 2021, the Multi-Ministry Taskforce announced tighter measures to be put in place from 16 May through 13 June 2021 to mitigate the risk of further community spread of COVID-19. This document provides the conditions under which religious organisations (ROs) are permitted to carry out activities in places of worship during this period of Phase Two (Heightened Alert). Phase Two (Heightened Alert) Under Phase Three (Heightened Alert) that began on 8 May 2021, enhanced precautionary measures were imposed on religious activities, namely a decrease in capacity for congregational and other worship services from 250 persons to 100 persons, without pre-event testing (PET), and no congregational singing. Under Phase Two (Heightened Alert), from 16 May through 13 June 2021, tighter measures will apply to religious activities. To reduce risks of community transmission, indoor “mask-off” activities will cease during this period. We will also further reduce the current permissible group size from up to 5 persons, to up to 2 persons. The new measures are as follows: a. Congregational and other worship services will be limited to 100 persons (decrease from 250 persons today) i. Up to 50 persons without PET; ii. Up to 100 persons with PET for all attendees; b. No singing and playing of wind/brass instruments for live performance elements; c. Suspension of all other non-congregational religious activities, except for religious rites; and d. Reduced capacity for marriage solemnizations as well as wakes, funerals and post-funeral rites. Annex A summarises the key changes for ROs going from Phase Three (Heightened Alert) to Phase Two (Heightened Alert). Worship Services From 16 May 2021, ROs may conduct congregational and other worship services at places of worship, with up to 50 persons at a time without PET, subject to safe management measures and the safe capacity of the premises. Religious and supporting workers should be kept to a minimum. Worshippers can participate in worship services in groups of no more than 2 persons (decrease from 5 persons today), in line with prevailing national requirements. ROs can conduct congregational and other worship services, for more than 50 persons and up to 100 persons at a time, only if there is PET for all worshippers1 as follows: a. ROs must ensure that all worshippers [except where paragraph (b) below applies] obtain a negative COVID-19 test result before they may be admitted into the venue where the service is being held.2 i. The test must be an MOH-approved COVID-19 test (either an Antigen Rapid Test (ART) or Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test) administered by an approved test provider.3 ii. The test results are only valid for 24 hours from the time an individual registers at the testing premises to take the test. The RO must ensure that the result of the test is valid until the end of the worshipper’s participation in the worship service. iii. The worshipper must be able to produce proof of the test result, which are either (i) Check-in Successful banner (displayed on the SafeEntry (Business) application upon scanning with TraceTogether App/Token), (ii) COVID-19 Test Result Notice (ART), (iii) COVID-19 Test Result Notice (PCR), or (iv) Patient Risk Profile Portal (PRPP) ART Result Slip. b. The requirements for PET in paragraph 6(a) above do not apply to worshippers who have been vaccinated4 or produce an exemption notice5. Before being admitted into the venue where the service is being held, the worshipper must produce valid documentation of either their vaccination or exemption notice which must remain valid until the end of the worshipper’s participation in the service. c. Where PET is required for a service, ROs must prominently display signs at each point of entry and exit (including emergency exit) to the venue where the service is being held, to indicate: i. The space is a restricted place6, and the duration for which it will be a restricted place (i.e. the duration of the service). ROs must clearly mark the boundaries of the restricted place (e.g. though fencing, rope, signs, walls, partition, screen). ii. That entry and remaining within the restricted place is allowed only to individuals with a cleared status (i.e. have a valid negative COVID-19 test result notice, valid documentation of vaccination or exemption notice). d. ROs are to highlight to worshippers attending services for more than 50 persons and up to 100 persons that they will be denied entry into the venue where the service is being held if they do not produce the relevant negative COVID-19 test result notice, vaccination notice, or exemption notice, with the necessary validity period. For congregational and other worship services exceeding 50 persons and up to 100 persons with PET, worshippers have to be segregated into zones holding no more than 50 persons each. a. As there should be no mingling of individuals across zones, each zone must be completely separated from another by either a physical solid partition (at least 1.8m high if not floor-to-ceiling, from wall-to-wall); or at least 3m physical spacing demarcated by continuous physical barriers (e.g. rope barrier). b. There must either be a separate ingress/egress for each zone or staggered entrance/exit timings so that worshippers from different zones do not mix with one another during entry/exit. c. ROs must also take reasonable steps to ensure that worshippers do not cross the physical barrier (where applicable) or enter another zone that they are not assigned to. ROs should continue to observe the following safe management measures for worship services (including services conducted with PET): a. Keep worship services to as short a duration as possible. There must be no reception or mingling between worshippers, before, during or after each worship service. b. All persons present (except children below 6 years of age) must wear a face mask at all times.7 Face shields are not permitted as substitutes for face masks. Young children are still strongly encouraged to use a mask, especially when they are in a group setting (e.g. attending worship service). c. Live performance elements are permitted during the worship service at places of worship, with the following safe management measures (see Annex B for details). i. A maximum of 30 persons are allowed to be involved in/support the conduct of the worship service. This includes persons on-stage, backstage or off-stage. ii. Unmasking will not be permitted. To ensure the safety of worshippers, singing or playing of wind/brass instruments will also not be permitted. iii. Singing (with or without the mask on) is not allowed. iv. Masks must be worn when speaking during congregational and other worship services. A face shield is not a permitted substitute for a proper mask. v. There must be at least a 3-metre setback between persons involved in the conduct of live performance elements and worshippers. vi. Minimise the duration of live performance elements for congregational and other worship services. d. There should be no sharing of prayer and other common items (e.g. holy books, passing of offertory baskets, prayer mats) as this increases the risk of COVID-19 transmission. Worshippers are to bring along their personal prayer items instead, where required. e. Places of worship with reduced air circulation (e.g. enclosed prayer spaces, air-conditioned worship hall) should, where possible, open doors and windows to naturally ventilate the space after each use. Marriage Solemnizations From 16 May 2021, ROs may continue to use places of worship to conduct marriage solemnizations where: a. Solemnizations involving up to 50 attendees: PET will not be required. b. Solemnizations involving between 51 - 100 attendees: PET will be required for all attendees.8 c. These activities are subject to safe management measures and the safe capacity of the premises, and exclude the solemnizer and religious and supporting workers, whose numbers should be kept to a minimum. d. If the total number of attendees is more than 50 (including the wedding couple), they must still be segregated into zones of up to 50 persons each (see paragraph 7 for zoning requirements). An individual attending the solemnization must remain within his or her respective assigned zone and must not enter an unassigned zone. e. Attendees must maintain a 1-metre safe distance between groups except a core “wedding party”9, which is allowed to comprise up to 20 persons (including the couple and their two witnesses). There should be no intermingling or mixing between groups nor between the “wedding party” and these other groups. f. There must not be any reception with food and drinks, or wedding celebrations that are not essential religious rites. g. ROs must also comply with prevailing safe management measures stipulated on the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI)’s website10. Although solemnizations at places of worship11 may continue to involve live instrumental music (non-wind/brass) with the necessary safe management measures in place (see Annex C), we strongly encourage this to be suspended or the duration be shortened during this period of heightened alert. Persons involved in/supporting the live instrumental music segment should be kept to the minimum. No other performances (e.g. singing, dance, variety act) are allowed. ROs are strongly encouraged to continue offering video link solemnizations as an option for couples. Funerals From 16 May 2021, funerals, wakes, installation of niches and post-funeral rites12 at places of worship can involve not more than 20 attendees (decrease from 30 today) at any one time, including the day of burial/cremation, and in groups of no more than 2 persons (excluding religious and supporting workers, whose numbers should be kept to a minimum), subject to safe management measures and the safe capacity of the premises. a. There must not be any reception with food and drinks. b. ROs must also comply with prevailing safe management measures listed on MTI’s website13. Funerary-related activities at places of worship14 may continue to involve live instrumental music (non-wind/brass) with the necessary safe management measures in place (see Annex C). Persons involved in/supporting the live instrumental music segment should be kept to the minimum. No other performances (e.g. singing, dance, variety act) are allowed. Visits to columbaria at places of worship should be kept as short as possible, with no mingling between groups of no more than 2 persons (decrease from 5 persons today). Other Religious Activities From 16 May 2021, ROs may continue to use places of worship to conduct religious rites, in groups of no more than 2 persons (decrease from 5 persons today) and maintain safe distancing. Religious and supporting workers involved in the conduct of these rites should be kept to a minimum. All other religious activities (e.g. religious classes for adults and children) will be suspended. Given the current need to minimise the risk of COVID-19 transmission, ROs are strongly encouraged to conduct these activities via remote means or defer them until the COVID-19 situation improves. Recording and Broadcast of Religious Services and Prayers ROs are encouraged to continue supporting the religious needs of their communities via remote means such as recording and broadcast of religious services and prayers. From 16 May 2021, ROs can have up to 15 persons on-location for these productions, of which up to 10 persons can be unmasked at any one time, with no more than 2 persons unmasked for singing and/or playing wind/brass instruments. Those singing and/or playing wind/brass instruments must maintain 2 metres between all other individuals. All other persons present must maintain a 1-metre separation. The time spent on-location for this activity should be kept as short as possible. The production team must also put in place safe management measures, including no-cross deployment between locations, and thorough cleaning of technical equipment. There shall be no audience. ROs who wish to use their premises for digital recording or broadcast are required to notify through the CPRO website of (i) the planned dates of the digital productions; (ii) venue; and (iii) confirmation of adherence to the performers and crew limits, before conducting the digital productions. Safe capacity in the place of worship All the permitted religious activities in paragraphs 9 to 19 (i.e. excluding congregational and other worship services) can continue to take place concurrently, subject to safe management measures, and stipulated capacity limits for these activities – and only if these activities can be conducted safely at separate locations within the place of worship, with no interaction between worshippers while entering, exiting or while in the premises. ROs are strongly encouraged to support the religious needs of their communities through remote means, as far as possible, in line with national guidelines to reduce social interactions, and thus minimise risk of COVID-19 transmission. a. ROs should consider reducing other concurrent activities when congregational and other worship services are ongoing, so that there is a smaller total number of people on the premises at any one time, which will help to minimise the risk of large clusters from forming. Deployment of manpower ROs should primarily engage their religious workers and staff to support the permitted religious activities but can deploy volunteers to support if necessary. The number of personnel involved in conducting each permitted activity should be kept to a minimum. From 16 May 2021, telecommuting will be the default for workplaces, so as to minimise the number of on-site religious workers and staff. The religious workers and administrative staff should comply with prevailing workplace safe management measures stipulated by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM).15 Restrictions against cross-deployment16 across worksites remain in place. TraceTogether and SafeEntry TraceTogether-only SafeEntry, where the TraceTogether App or Token is required for SafeEntry check-ins, will be required at all venues that are required to implement SafeEntry from 17 May 202117. ROs must make the necessary preparations to accept check-ins by the TraceTogether App or Token. ROs can refer to www.safeentry.gov.sg for FAQs, or more information on how to set up TraceTogether-only SafeEntry for their premises. SafeEntry Gateway (SEGW) will be progressively introduced as an additional mode of SafeEntry check-in to provide quicker and more seamless check-in using the TraceTogether App or Token. Existing modes of SafeEntry check-in will remain in place. Since 19 Apr 2021, ROs conducting congregational and other worship services for more than 100 persons have been required to deploy the SafeEntry Gateway at their main entrances as an additional check-in mode. ROs conducting congregational and other worship services for 100 persons or less will also be required to deploy the SEGW at their main entrances by 15 June 2021. ROs may deploy either the physical SEGW Box or use the SEGW function found in the latest version of the SafeEntry (Business) App based on their needs. [Refer to for more information.]. Mandatory submission of Safe Management Plans ROs must acknowledge through the CPRO website the new conditions for religious activities imposed from 16 May through 13 June 2021 before commencing the activities. ROs that have not submitted their Safe Management Plans (SMPs) previously for Phase 3 will need to submit their plans, at least 2 days before commencing any activities outlined above. The detailed requirements and format for submitting these SMPs can be found at www.cpro.gov.sg. MCCY reserves the right to suspend a RO’s activities if there are gaps in the SMP submitted and until the necessary rectifications are made. ROs are responsible for the implementation of safe management measures and action could be taken for lapses and breaches. Should there be any confirmed COVID-19 cases linked to a RO’s premises or place of worship, the premises may be closed for a period of time as determined by the authorities. Working together to make Singapore COVID-safe The tightening of measures for religious activities reflect the seriousness of the current COVID-19 situation. We will have to remain vigilant and regularly refine our safe management measures in order to minimise the risk of COVID-19 transmission. MCCY will continue to work with our ROs to ensure a COVID-19 safe environment for religious activities. Issued by: Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth\n",
      "Requirements for Safe Management Measures at the workplace Read the sector-specific guidelines and infographic on Safe Management Measures at the workplace. From 16 May 2021 to 13 June 2021, the Safe Management Measures for the workplace will be tightened. Previously, up to 50% of employees28 who are able to work from home could be at the workplace at any time. Now, employers must ensure that all employees who are able to work from home do so. Social gatherings at the workplace are disallowed. These measures help lower transmission risks by reducing the levels of interaction at common spaces at or near the workplace, and in public places, including public transport. Issued on 9 May 2020 Updated as of 14 May 2021 The tripartite partners (MOM, SNEF, and NTUC) have updated the workplace safe management measures to allow greater flexibility for businesses, while mitigating the risk of widespread COVID-19 transmission. Effective implementation of these measures will help to avoid having to impose tighter measures. These requirements are meant for general workplace settings. Specific workplaces like construction worksites and shipyards may have to fulfil additional requirements and should refer to sector-specific requirements1. Agencies including MOM, Building and Construction Authority (BCA) and Enterprise Singapore (ESG) will continue to enforce safe management measures and take action against errant employers. This may include issuing stop-work orders and financial penalties. Safe Management Measures To ensure COVID-safe workplaces, employers should take care of: Your workers; Your workplaces; and Those who may become unwell at your workplaces. A. Take care of your workers Provide employees options to work from home. From 16 May 2021 to 13 June 2021, employers must exercise heightened vigilance at the workplace. Employers must ensure that all employees who are able to work from home do so. Employers are encouraged to support as many employees in working from home as possible. This will help to limit the number of employees exposed at the workplace at any point in time, and reduce crowding in common areas, e.g. pantries, toilets, lifts. Having more employees work from home will also help sustain business operations should a case emerge at the workplace. Work-from-home measures should enable employees to maintain work-life harmony while continuing to meet business needs. The Tripartite Advisory on mental well-being at workplaces sets out practical guidance on measures that employers can adopt to support their employees’ mental well-being under a variety of work arrangements. For employees who are still unable to work from home, employers should review work processes, provide the necessary IT equipment to employees and adopt solutions that enable remote working and online collaboration. Employers are encouraged to leverage technology2 to ensure business continuity and safe management. Companies should continue to conduct virtual meetings as far as possible. Companies should pay special attention to vulnerable employees3 (e.g. persons who are aged 60 and above, and patients who are immunocompromised4 or have concurrent medical conditions). Employers are encouraged to enable these employees to work-from-home, allow them to travel to/from work at off-peak timings, temporarily redeploy them to another role within the company, or take other appropriate measures to reduce their exposure to infection risk. For employees at the workplace, employers must ensure the following precautions are in place: Stagger start times and allow flexible workplace hours5: This will spread out staff across time and place, and reduces possible congregation of employees at common spaces at or near the workplace, such as entrances, exits, lobbies, canteens, pantries. It also reduces congestion of people in public places, including public transport. Employers are encouraged to stagger the start times for all employees such that at least half of all employees arrive at the workplace at or after 10am, as far as possible. If physical meetings are needed, they can be scheduled after 10 am. These measures would enable more employees to avoid peak-hour travel, especially if employees require the use of public transport. Timings of lunch and other breaks should also be staggered accordingly. If it is not feasible to implement staggered start times, flexible workplace hours, and staggered break hours due to operational reasons (e.g. manufacturing production line activities), employers must implement other systemic arrangements to reduce congregation of employees at common spaces6. No cross-deployment across worksites7: No employee should work at more than one worksite. If cross-deployment cannot be avoided (e.g. due to the nature of the job), additional safeguards must be taken to minimise the risk of cross infection8. Employers should avoid organising work-related events unless critical (e.g. training session): All work-related events9 that proceed must adhere to prevailing workplace Safe Management Measures and are subjected to the following requirements10: The number of persons per event must be capped at 50 persons to limit the risk of exposure to infection. Attendees must maintain at least 1 metre safe distancing between individual attendees, as per the requirement at the workplace. Food and drinks are not allowed at work-related events. Work-related events at third-party venues11 will also be subject to any additional premise owners’ safe management policies. Social gatherings at the workplace are disallowed: Employees should have their meal breaks at the workplace individually. Wear masks at the workplace: Employers must ensure that all onsite personnel, including employees, visitors, suppliers and contractors, wear a mask and other necessary personal protective equipment13 at all times at the workplace, except during activities that require masks to be removed14. Masks will have to be worn immediately after the activity is completed. Employers should ensure that they have sufficient masks for all employees, including any need to replace masks more frequently due to workplace conditions15. Where possible, employers should consider improving the working environment for employees to enable them to sustain wearing the masks. Observe good personal hygiene: Employers should encourage their employees to observe good personal hygiene, e.g. wash their hands regularly and refrain from touching their face. B. Take care of the workplace Control access at the workplace to only essential employees and authorised visitors. Employers must use the SafeEntry visitor management system to record the entry of all personnel (including employees and visitors) entering the workplace16. All employees and visitors should check-in and check-out of workplaces using SafeEntry (with their TraceTogether app or token) to help MOH in establishing potential transmission chains. Personnel who are unwell (including having a fever upon temperature screening) must be refused entry to the workplace. Visitors who are unwell should be asked to reschedule their appointments to another day when they are well, or be served via alternate means.17 Employers must ensure that employees and visitors must declare via SafeEntry or other means18 (e.g. electronic or hard copy records), before being allowed to enter premises, that they: Are currently not under a Quarantine Order, Stay-Home Notice; Have not had close contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case in the past 14 days19; and Do not have any fever or flu-like symptoms. Adhere to travel advisories: Employers should ensure that their employees adhere to MOH’s prevailing travel advisory. Where physical interaction cannot be avoided, precautions should be taken to ensure clear physical spacing of at least 1 metre through physical means20 and demarcation of safe physical distances (at least 1m apart) using visual indicators, where possible, in the following situations21: Between all persons at meeting rooms, work areas, and workstations; and At all times during work-related events held at the workplace. Employers who are service buyers should also require their suppliers / contractors to implement similar safe distancing measures, so that operations and business interactions with these suppliers / contractors are kept safe. Where physical interactions are still necessary, e.g. delivery of goods, employers must adopt precautionary measures such as scheduling delivery times by different suppliers in a staggered manner. The durations of such transactions should be kept as short as possible. Minimise need for physical touchpoints: Employers should reduce the occurrences of, or need for common physical touchpoints in the workplace where possible (e.g. by deploying contactless access controls). Where physical contact is needed, additional safeguards must be taken to minimise the risk of cross infection (e.g. frequent disinfection of touchpoints). Step up cleaning of workplace premises through the following: Employers must ensure regular cleaning of common spaces, particularly areas with high human contact22. Where physical meetings are held or meals are taken at common spaces such as pantries or canteens, employers must clean and disinfect tables between each meeting or seating. Employers must ensure that machinery and equipment shared between different employees across different shifts or alternate teams are cleaned and disinfected before changing hands. The sanitation and hygiene advisories23 disseminated by the National Environmental Agency (NEA) must be adhered to. Provide cleaning and disinfecting agents at the following areas: Cleaning agents (e.g. liquid soap, toilet paper) must be available at all toilets and hand-wash stations. Disinfecting agents (e.g. hand sanitisers) must be installed at all human traffic stoppage points within the workplace, such as entrances, reception areas, security booths and lift lobbies. Disinfecting agents (e.g. disinfectant sprays, paper towels and wipes) must be provided at meeting rooms and other common spaces such as pantries or canteens. C. Take care of workers who become unwell at the workplace Ensure regular checks for temperature and respiratory symptoms24 for all onsite employees and visitors, twice daily or where relevant. Employers must be able to demonstrate that these checks are in place during inspections. Record proximity data on phones: To help MOH to more quickly identify potential close contacts of COVID-19 patients and reduce disease transmission, employers should encourage all employees to download and activate the TraceTogether app25. Actively monitor unwell employees and guard against incipient outbreaks: Employees at the workplace who have visited a clinic must submit to their employers records of their MCs and diagnoses provided (only for COVID-19-related symptoms, including acute respiratory infections), and if they were tested for COVID-19 and the results of their tests. Employers must take preventive action to guard against incipient outbreaks at the workplace, such as advising employees who are unwell to stay home and consult a doctor rather than going to the workplace, requiring these employees on MCs to closely monitor their health before returning to the workplace and requiring these employees’ close contacts at the workplace to monitor their health more regularly. Where possible, employers should ensure that each employee visits only one clinic for check-ups if unwell. Otherwise, employees should inform the clinic of all recent doctor visits over past 14 days for any symptoms that may be related to COVID-1926. Manage unwell cases: An evacuation plan must be prepared for unwell or suspected cases, as well as for other onsite personnel. Any employee who is feeling unwell or showing symptoms of illness should report to his employer, leave the workplace and consult a doctor immediately, even if symptoms may appear mild. Employers must track and record these cases as part of Safe Management Measures. For incapacitated or unconscious individuals, employers must clear the area of other personnel and administer aid immediately. Employers should call 995 for an emergency ambulance to ferry them to the nearest hospital. Manage confirmed cases: A follow-up plan must be put in place in the event of a confirmed case. Upon being notified of a confirmed case, employers must adopt the following precautionary measures: Immediately vacate and cordon-off the immediate section of the workplace premises where the confirmed case worked. There is no need to vacate the building or the whole floor if there had been no sustained and close contact with the confirmed case; and Carry out a thorough cleaning and disinfecting all relevant on-site areas and assets that were exposed to confirmed cases, in accordance to NEA guidelines. For worksites with confirmed cases, businesses could be suspended if there are public health grounds. D. Implement a system of Safe Management Measures Employers must establish a system to implement the above Safe Management Measures to provide a safe working environment and minimise risks of COVID-19 outbreaks. These measures must be implemented in a sustainable manner for as long as necessary. Implement a detailed monitoring plan to ensure compliance with Safe Management Measures and timely resolution of outstanding issues27. Appoint Safe Management Officer(s) (“SMO”) to assist in the implementation, coordination and monitoring of the system of Safe Management Measures at the workplace. For unionised companies, union leaders or WSH officers could be appointed as SMOs. Employers must provide appointed SMOs with adequate instruction, information and supervision as is necessary for them to fulfil their required duties. SMOs are strongly encouraged to receive training. The duties of the Officer(s) include: To coordinate implementation of Safe Management Measures, including identifying relevant risks, recommending and assisting in implementing measures to mitigate the risks, and communicating the measures to all personnel working in the workplace; To conduct inspections and checks, to ensure compliance at all times. Any non-compliance found during the inspections should be reported and documented; To remedy non-compliance found during the inspections and checks through immediate action; and To keep records of inspections, checks and correction actions, to be made available upon request by a Government Inspector. Employers must ensure that the measures above are in place, communicated and explained to employees prior to resuming work onsite (refer to Annex B for a checklist of Safe Management Measures that should be in place for resumption of business activities). Signs should also be put up to remind employees and visitors to observe all measures in place. Unionised companies should engage their unions on such arrangements. Employees should also do their part in adhering to the measures to create a safe working environment. Those who wish to report breaches or poor practices can do so via SnapSAFE, an app that allows the reporting of workplace safety and health issues to MOM.

Those who have a compromised or impaired immune system. Workplace hours here refers to the hours spent at the physical workplace. E.g. arrange for different groups of employees to arrive / depart through different entrances / exits. This will not apply to industries / companies that need to do so due to the nature of their work. Such companies will be required to demonstrate that cross-deployment or interaction between employees is critical for business operations, when requested by MOM or their sector agencies. E.g. systems are in place to ensure no direct contact between the cross-deployed personnel. I.e. events not organised primarily for social interaction. Work-related events that are allowed to proceed are those which primarily involve employees or stakeholders, such as conferences / seminars, corporate retreats, staff training sessions, Annual General Meetings and Extraordinary General Meetings. This is separate and distinct from MICE events approved by the Singapore Tourism Board (STB). Work-related events are allowed to resume at third-party venues, but are subject to any additional premise owners’ safe management policies. <nil> Masks for general office workplaces; for other workplace settings, please refer to sector-specific guidelines. The requirement for masks to be worn can be waived when carrying out, in the course of employment, an activity that requires that no mask may be worn, or that it must be removed in order that other equipment may be worn or used, to carry out that activity, or when riding a motorcycle in the course of employment or otherwise. E.g. humid workplaces, call centres where the nature of the work may necessitate frequent mask changing. For the full list of workplaces where SafeEntry must be deployed, please refer to Such as tele-conferencing. Not applicable for individuals seeking treatment at a medical facility. Not applicable to COVID-19 frontline workers or recovered individuals within 3 months of their first positive PCR COVID-19 test. E.g. barriers between workstations, relocation of workstations, meeting room seats. The monitoring and enforcement of safe distancing could be aided by appropriate technology (e.g. CCTVs, video analytics) where possible. Such as counters where customers are served, rooms where visitors are hosted, as well as general public access areas such as lifts, pantries, toilets, and bin areas (including bin centres where necessary). Including coughing, sneezing, breathlessness, a runny nose, or loss of sense of smell. Data recorded by TraceTogether is stored on the user’s device, and is shared with MOH for contact-tracing purposes when the user is suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19. Including but not limited to typical symptoms such as fever, cough and shortness of breath. E.g. follow-up on non-compliance and efforts to mitigate risks. Employers should note that interns, part-time staff, etc. who are under a contract of service are also employees.\n",

Approval must be sought from ESG. 8 These play areas refer to the facilities provided free-of-charge in the shops or at the malls’ common areas. 9 More information on SafeEntry and a full list of places where SafeEntry must be deployed can be found at 10 However, all retail establishments and lifestyle-related services must require their employees to do SafeEntry check-in. They must transit to TraceTogether-only SafeEntry when this is implemented from 17 May 2021.Page 4 of 16 8.3.2. From 17 May 2021, TraceTogether-only SafeEntry will be implemented at the above establishments. Refer to Annex A for details on the SafeEntry implementation. 8.3.3. From 15 June 2021, retail establishments required to deploy SafeEntry for customers and visitors will need to provide the SafeEntry Gateway11 (SEGW) as an option for SafeEntry check-in. SEGW is available as a feature within the SafeEntry (Business) App (updated to version 1.1.0 and above) and as a physical standalone device (SEGW Box). These establishments may apply for a free SEGW Box12 . 8.4. Health checks 8.4.1. All malls, large standalone stores, supermarkets and stores providing personal care and beauty services must conduct temperature screening13 , employees must check for visible symptoms14 for customers at entrances, and turn away those with fever and/or who appear unwell15 . 8.5.

Employees must also not apply the product sample directly on customers. 8.5.4. Retail establishments must ensure frequent cleaning and disinfection of: • Common spaces such as counters and display shelves, where customers are served, as well as play areas for children/toddlers/infants; • Items such as shopping trolleys/baskets and handrails, which have high human contact; and • Interactive hardware such as iPads, mall directories, self-checkout kiosks or lift buttons. 9. Retail establishments should put up clear signages to remind customers to comply with safe management requirements where applicable, and train and deploy service personnel to provide clear communication to customers on SMMs. 10. Refer to Annex B for other recommended guidelines, and Annex C on guidance for specific trades. 11 The SEGW enables contactless detection of both the TraceTogether App and Token, and serves as an additional means of SafeEntry check-in that is quicker and more seamless. It also allows users to check if their Token has run out of battery or is not working. 12 Refer to go.gov.sg/gateway-overview for how to implement the SEGW and apply for a free SEGW Box. 13 Individuals with temperatures above 38 degrees Celsius are considered as having a fever. Supermarkets and stores providing beauty services in malls need not conduct temperature screening and checks on visible symptoms for customers if the mall is already doing so. They should, however, do so if they operate outside the mall hours. 14 Notable visible symptoms to look out for include: (a) coughing; (b) sneezing; (c) breathlessness; and (d) a runny nose. 15 Except where the individual is entering the permitted premises to seek medical treatment for a specific symptom.Page 5 of 16 Safe Management Measures – Workplace premises16 11. To ensure COVID-safe workplaces, retail establishments should take care of their workers, workplaces and those who may become unwell at their workplaces, as outlined in MOM’s Requirements for Safe Management Measures at the Workplace. Enforcement of measures 12. Government agencies will be conducting inspections to check on the proper implementation of the SMMs. Under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act passed in Parliament on 7 April 2020, first-time offenders will face a fine of up to S$10,000, imprisonment of up to six months, or both. For subsequent offences, they may face a fine of up to S$20,000, imprisonment of up to twelve months, or both. 13. Businesses that do not implement or comply with the government’s SMMs may be ineligible for government grants, loans, tax rebates and other assistance, and may also be subject to temporary closures. Annex A – Details of SafeEntry check-in and TraceTogether-only SafeEntry implementation Annex B – Other recommended guidelines for customer-facing operations Annex C – Trade-specific Safe Management Measures for Retail Establishments and Lifestyle-Related Services Issued by: Enterprise Singapore Housing & Development Board Singapore Tourism Board Urban Redevelopment Authority Updated as of 18 May 2021 _________________________________________________________________________ 16 Refers to the retail establishments’ back-of-house operations involving employees, including at offices, warehouses and manufacturing facilities.Page 6 of 16 ANNEX A Details of SafeEntry check-in and TraceTogether-only SafeEntry implementation - Before 17 May 2021, SafeEntry check-in can be done by: i) Scanning of the SafeEntry QR code using a QR code scanner on a smartphone; ii) Using the SingPass App; iii) Using the TraceTogether App; iv) Presenting the TraceTogether Token QR code or ID card to the camera/2D scanner linked to SafeEntry (Business) App for scanning; or v) Bringing the TraceTogether Token or App close to a SEGW. - From 17 May 2021, when TraceTogether-only SafeEntry is implemented at the retail establishments (as listed in paragraph 8.3.1)17, SafeEntry check-in can only be done by: i) Scanning the SafeEntry QR code using the TraceTogether App; ii) Presenting the TraceTogether Token QR code to the camera/2D scanner linked to SafeEntry (Business) App for scanning; or iii) Bringing the TraceTogether Token or App close to a SEGW. - To help ease the transition, scanning of barcodes on ID cards will be retained until 31 May 2021. Following which, ID cards can only be used under extenuating circumstances. For more information, please refer to the FAQs on www.safeentry.gov.sg. - In addition, from 15 June 2021, retail establishments required to deploy SafeEntry for customers and visitors will need to provide the SEGW as an option for SafeEntry check-in. SEGW is available as a feature within the SafeEntry (Business) App (updated to version 1.1.0 and above) and as a physical standalone device (SEGW Box). These establishments may apply for a free SEGW Box18 . - To prepare for the implementation of TraceTogether-only SafeEntry, the above retail establishments should already accept TraceTogether Tokens as a mode of SafeEntry check-in19. Businesses that accept ID cards for check-in will be able to accept Token for check-in if they are already using: i) A smartphone loaded with the SafeEntry (Business) App setup; ii) a laptop and scanner setup if the scanner can scan barcode and QR code; or iii) a SEGW App or SEGW Box. - For avoidance of doubt, TraceTogether Token check-in and SEGW both refer to the mode of check-in, while TraceTogether-only SafeEntry refers to the overall programme which will permit only TraceTogether modes of check-in (i.e. TraceTogether App or Token). - After TraceTogether-only SafeEntry is implemented from 17 May 2021: i) Large retail stores > 930 sqm (or 10,000 sqft) and supermarkets located within a TraceTogether-only SafeEntry building (e.g. malls) that have the same operating hours as the building will no longer be required to deploy SafeEntry check-in for customers, vendors and visitors. Those located within a TraceTogether-only SafeEntry building but with longer operating hours must implement TraceTogether-only SafeEntry outside the building’s operating hours. 17 All retail establishments must require their employees to do SafeEntry check-in using TraceTogether-only SafeEntry when this is implemented from 17 May 2021. 18 Refer to go.gov.sg/gateway-overview for how to implement the SEGW and apply for a free SEGW Box. 19 TraceTogether Token check-in is done by premises scanning the QR codes on the TraceTogether Tokens of customers, vendors and visitors. Refer to to find out how to implement Token check-in mode.Page 7 of 16 ii) Small retail stores (< 930 sqm or 10,000 sqft) that were not required to deploy SafeEntry for customers but have voluntarily done so, should remove their SafeEntry check-ins.Page 8 of 16 ANNEX B Other recommended guidelines for customer-facing operations A. Queue management - Queues should not cause congestion for neighbouring establishments or at other parts of the mall. B. Crowd management - Limit groups of customers entering the store to no more than 2 persons. - Do not hold activities that would attract large crowds inside and outside of the retail establishment (e.g. celebrity appearances, aggressive shopping deals, closed-door members sales). - A standard operating procedure (SOP) should be put in place to manage long queues and large crowds that could form inside or outside stores (e.g. where popular products are displayed) and/or the mall. - Encourage the use of self-checkout, and cashless or contactless payment to reduce contact between employees and customers. - Encourage customers to book appointments, for the viewing and testing of products, as well as for services (e.g. consultation, repairs). - Consider placing frequently purchased goods and necessities near the entrance or checkout to facilitate movement and reduce in-store dwell time. - Operators should take additional steps to manage the capacity within common play areas for children/toddlers/infants (e.g. deploying an employee to man the area), where practicable. C. Health checks - All retail stores not mandated to conduct temperature screening and not located within malls are encouraged to do so and check for visible symptoms where practicable. D. Cleanliness and hygiene - Limit display and testing of products, e.g. stationery, laptops, mobile phones, etc. Employees to conduct product demonstrations if required. Such products should also be sanitised regularly. - Where possible, place hand sanitisers in close proximity of store entrances, high-touch surfaces like door handles, as well as common play areas. Encourage customers to sanitise their hands before entering stores and/or handling products on display. - Supermarkets and other retail establishments which provide trolleys and baskets to their customers are encouraged to provide disinfectant wipes for customers to clean the handles of such trolleys and baskets. - Products that customers touch frequently such as clothes, footwear, jewellery, accessories and optical products, should be cleaned, sanitised or sterilised frequently, where possible. E. Encourage online retail, and “click & collect” for goods and delivery - Encourage online retail and click-and-collect from store, to reduce dwell time - Where practicable, collection and delivery from the store must be spaced out and contactless. - Take reasonable steps to ensure that delivery personnel observe at least one-metre spacing at all times and do not cluster together. Page 9 of 16 - Refer to the Advisory for Delivery Businesses for guidelines on delivery requirements. F. Use of retail establishments as a third-party venue for work-related events - If a retail outlet is used as a third-party event space, as a best practice, only one event should be held in the outlet at a time. If not feasible, each third-party event should be clearly demarcated from the others, as well as from the main consumer shopping area. Each area should be kept completely separate by either a solid partition (at least 1.8- metre high, from wall to wall), or a minimum 3-metre spacing demarcated by continuous physical barriers (e.g. plexiglass screens, barricade tape, queue poles). There should be no mixing or intermingling of guests from separate events.

      "CEA Ref: N13-21 Date: 15 May 2021 By Email To: Key Executive Officers and Real Estate Salespersons Dear Sir / Madam, [NOTICE 13-21] UPDATED ADVISORY ON PROPERTY TRANSACTION ACTIVITIES BY ESTATE AGENTS AND REAL ESTATE SALESPERSONS UNDER PHASE 2 (HEIGHTENED ALERT) IN THE FIGHT AGAINST COVID-19 1. This notice is to update Key Executive Officers (KEOs) and Real Estate Salespersons (RESs) on the new measures to observe from 16 May 2021 through 13 June 2021 (inclusive) to minimise the risk of transmission of COVID-19. Updated advisory 2. On 14 May 2021, the Multi-Ministry Taskforce (MTF) announced that: a. The permissible group size will be further reduced from five to two persons. b. The maximum number of distinct visitors allowed per household per day will similarly be reduced from five to two persons. 3. Both restrictions take effect from 16 May 2021 and will continue until 13 June 2021 (inclusive). Individuals are also strongly encouraged to continue to limit their overall number of social gatherings to not more than two per day, whether to another household, or meeting with friends and family members in a public place. 4. The real estate agency industry must continue to play its part to reduce the spread of COVID-19. The number of locally transmitted COVID-19 cases and unlinked community cases have continued to increase, and the situation could quickly escalate if these cases are not contained swiftly and decisively. Given that the nature of estate agency work may require you to be in various enclosed spaces and in close proximity with different persons and clients, you must be extra vigilant and take all necessary precautions against the spread of COVID-19 in Singapore. 5. With the new announcement, this means that you need to ensure that no more than two distinct persons a day may visit a property inhabited by a household when you conduct estate agency work. The two distinct persons include you and any other person who is visiting the property. You will need to check that your client and the property occupant(s), if the client does not live at the property being visited, are aware of the updated rules, and the number of visitors that may visit the property per day. 6. In addition, in line with the need to act decisively to contain the risk of any spread from undetected cases in the community, you are to defer all door-to-door marketing activities, including flyer distribution to households and business premises, until further notice. 7. Estate Agents (EAs) and RESs are advised to observe this notice and attached updated Guide, which supersedes the previous Notice 10-21 dated 5 May 2021, from 16 May 2021 onwards.8. We seek your continued support and cooperation to protect the health and safety of your employees, RESs, clients and the community. Yours sincerely, KELLY NG DEPUTY DIRECTOR (POLICY & PLANNING) COUNCIL FOR ESTATE AGENCIES Annex – CEA Guide on Property Transaction Activities by EAs and RESs under Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) in the fight against COVID-19 (15 May 2021).As at 15 May 2021 Annex to CEA Notice 13-21 CEA GUIDE ON PROPERTY TRANSACTION ACTIVITIES BY ESTATE AGENTS AND REAL ESTATE SALESPERSONS UNDER PHASE 2 (HEIGHTENED ALERT) IN THE FIGHT AGAINST COVID-19 1. This Guide sets out how estate agents (EAs) and Real Estate Salespersons (RESs) can conduct your operations at your office and your property transaction activities in a safe manner to minimise the risk of transmission of COVID-19. This Guide has been updated following the new heightened measures announced by the Multi-Ministry Taskforce (MTF) on 14 May 2021. 2. In addition to this Guide, you must follow all mandatory requirements and guidance issued by other government ministries and agencies (see Appendix). GENERAL PRINCIPLES 3. The real estate agency industry has an important role to play in reducing the spread of COVID-19 in Singapore. We must remain vigilant in our fight against COVID-19. The following general principles will continue to apply to EAs and RESs: a. Fighting COVID-19 is our collective responsibility: The real estate agency industry shares the responsibility of protecting yourselves and the community you serve to minimise the risk of community transmission. All of us must continue to exercise social responsibility to prevent new cases and clusters from emerging in our industry and community. b. Safe management measures should be an integral part of property transaction activities: As you conduct your operations and property transaction activities, you should continue to adopt a cautious approach and accord priority to protect public health and safety. CORPORATE FUNCTIONS General requirements 4. You are to comply with the Ministry of Manpower’s (MOM) requirements for safe management measures at your office (click here). Work-from-home will be the default at workplaces, and you must ensure that employees who are able to work from home do so. Group or mass activities 5. You are encouraged to use information technology (IT) tools such as video or virtual conferencing platforms, in place of group or mass activities. 6. If a group or mass activity cannot be done virtually, EAs must adopt a cautious approach and reduce the number of people interacting with one another and the duration of the activity. EAs must comply with relevant safe management measures and guidelines for events and activities1 , such as limits on capacity and group sizes. 1 This includes consumer-facing events, such as property launches, roadshows and other marketing events.PROPERTY TRANSACTION ACTIVITIES Standard requirements for on-site property transaction activities 7. You should continue to use IT tools and solutions for your work as much as possible, and only meet your clients in person if it is absolutely necessary for the conduct of the property transaction. If the activity cannot be done virtually, you must take the necessary safe management precautions and record the details of all persons whom you meet. This means that: a. EAs and RESs must adopt the following precautions and ensure that all persons at the activity do the same (hereinafter referred to as “safety precautions”): i. Wear masks2 . ii. Maintain a physical distance of at least one metre between persons. iii. If a person who turns up for the activity is unwell (e.g. exhibits respiratory symptoms and/or has a fever), ask him not to participate in the activity, and to see a doctor. b. If the activity is conducted in premises where safe management measures are not in place (e.g. at a client’s place of residence) or at the transaction property (whether occupied or unoccupied), you must record the entry of your client(s) or any person accompanying you into the premises 2 Face shields should not be used as a substitute for mask wear, except for certain exceptions as permitted by MOH.(hereinafter referred to as “contact tracing requirements”). You may choose to keep the records manually or using other methods3 . c. If you are conducting viewing, handover or takeover activities, you are encouraged to take appropriate measures to reduce contact with surfaces (hereinafter referred to as \"contactless requirements”): i. Encourage all attendees to sanitise their hands. ii. Open doors and windows, and switch on lights in the property so as to minimise your clients touching these during the on-site activity. If the property is occupied, you may wish to request the occupants to do so prior to the activity. iii. Request your clients not to touch surfaces within the premises. You may wear gloves to prepare and facilitate the viewing, handover or takeover with minimum contact of the property by your clients. iv. Do not hand out materials at the meeting (e.g. marketing materials or documents relating to the handover or takeover such as end-of\u0002tenancy checklist, inventory list or property condition report). You should use electronic means to deliver such materials to your clients. 3 EAs and RESs are encouraged to adopt the use of TraceTogether via the TraceTogether token or mobile application for all your estate agency work with your clients and whenever you engage and meet other people in the course of your activities. Listing and marketing properties 8. You are encouraged to market properties using non-physical means (e.g. digital or telephone marketing). The following activities should be deferred until further notice: a. Door-to-door marketing activities (e.g. canvassing from door to door to request owners of unlisted properties if they would like to sell their property). This includes distributing flyers to households and business premises. b. Marketing of properties (including new developments) in public spaces. This includes marketing and distributing flyers at publicly accessible common spaces such as public transport nodes and HDB common areas. 9. If you lease enclosed premises in buildings zoned for retail use such as malls to conduct property transaction activities, you are to comply with the safe management measures for retail establishments that have been set out by Enterprise Singapore, Housing & Development Board (HDB), Singapore Tourism Board and Urban Redevelopment Authority. The measures that apply to all customer-facing operations of retail establishments include safe distancing, crowd management, contact tracing, health checks, cleanliness and hygiene measures. 10. EAs and RESs may enter properties to photograph or film the properties in order to conduct online viewings thereafter, subject to the consent of the seller or landlord. In addition, you must: a. Comply with the safety precautions and contact tracing requirements as stated in paragraph 7(a) and paragraph 7(b) respectively. b. If the property is inhabited by a household, check with your client and the property occupant(s), if the client does not live at the property being visited,to ensure that your visit would not exceed the cap of two distinct visitors (which includes yourself) per household per day, and that your client and the property occupant(s) are aware of this requirement for all visitors. For vacant properties, ensure that no more than two persons visit the property at any one time. Such persons include you and any professional whom you engaged to assist you with preparing the property for listing or virtual viewing (e.g. video production crew). c. Minimise the amount of time spent in the property. d. Minimise interactions with the occupants if the property is occupied. Meeting your client 11. You are encouraged to continue using IT tools in place of face-to-face interaction, such as video or virtual conferencing platforms to meet with your client. 12. If the meeting cannot be done virtually (e.g. to sign property transaction documents that require “wet-ink” signatures), you should do so in premises where safe management measures are in place, such as the EA’s office. You should reduce the number of persons attending the meeting to the minimum extent possible. 13. If you meet your client at his place of residence or at the transaction property, you must: a. Comply with the safety precautions and contact tracing requirements as stated in paragraph 7(a) and paragraph 7(b) respectively. b. If the property is inhabited by a household, check with your client and the property occupant(s), if the client does not live at the property being visited, to ensure that your visit would not exceed the cap of two distinct visitors (which includes yourself) per household per day, and that your client and the property occupant(s) are aware of this requirement for all visitors. For vacant properties, ensure that no more than two persons visit the property at any one time. Such persons include you and any other person who is visiting the property. c. Minimise the time spent with the client. Conducting viewings 14. You are encouraged to arrange for virtual viewings first before doing viewings in person to reduce the number of viewings that your client will need to decide on the property. 15. Open houses are still not allowed as these may attract large groups of people congregating at the property. 16. When conducting physical viewings, you are to: a. Comply with the safety precautions and contact tracing requirements, and are encouraged to adopt contactless measures as stated in paragraph 7(a), paragraph 7(b) and paragraph 7(c) respectively. b. Arrange for all viewings to be done on an appointment basis only, with the start and end times clearly stated and known to the attendees of the viewing. Keep viewings short and end by the scheduled end time. You must not schedule back-to-back viewings for vacant properties. There should be a time gap between appointments to prevent gatherings or physical interactions with other persons from taking place in or near the property.c. If the property is inhabited by a household, check with your client and the property occupant(s), if the client does not live at the property being visited, to ensure that your visit would not exceed the cap of two distinct visitors (which includes yourself) per household per day, and that your client and the property occupant(s) are aware of this requirement for all visitors. For vacant properties, ensure that no more than two distinct persons visit the property at any one time. Such persons include you and any other person who is visiting the property. 17. Where advisories have been issued by relevant authorities (e.g. by the Urban Redevelopment Authority) in relation to clients’ business activities, EAs and RESs should adhere to these advisories and advise their clients accordingly. Signing and delivering estate agency agreement and property transaction documents 18. You should continue to use IT tools and solutions as much as possible, and only meet your client in person if it is absolutely necessary for the conduct of the property transaction. This means that you should: a. Use electronic means to deliver and receive the documents from your client. b. Arrange for a phone, video or virtual meeting to go through and explain the clauses in the documents to your client. You must give your client sufficient time to read and understand the meaning and consequences of the provisions in the documents. c. Use electronic signatures in place of “wet-ink” signatures for signing of the estate agency agreement. d. If you meet the client at a property that is inhabited by a household, ensure that your visit would not exceed the cap of two distinct visitors (which includes yourself) per household per day. 19. Different organisations such as banks and the transacting parties may have their own policies or preferences on the use of electronic signatures. Contracting parties may consider the use of secure electronic signatures for property transactions for greater assurance, such as “Sign with SingPass”, which allows SingPass users to use the SingPass mobile application to digitally sign an electronic document. You should seek advice from appropriate professionals such as lawyers if you or your client have any doubt in relation to the use of electronic signatures for these documents. 20. Please note that HDB currently does not allow the exercise of option to be done remotely or electronically. Forms prescribed by HDB, such as its Option to Purchase form, require “wet-ink” signatures. Handing or taking over rental properties 21. You may assist to facilitate the handover or takeover of rental properties. However, you should first arrange for virtual meetings to discuss handover or takeover matters. 22. When meeting, you should keep interactions short and adhere strictly to the group size cap and/or daily visitor cap. In addition, you must comply with the safety precautions and contact tracing requirements, and are encouraged to adopt contactless measures as stated in paragraph 7(a), paragraph 7(b) and paragraph 7(c) respectively.CONCLUSION 23. Where mandatory requirements and guidance by other government ministries and agencies have been issued, you should adhere to them and advise your client accordingly. These authorities include Ministry of Health, Ministry of Manpower, Ministry of Trade and Industry, Building and Construction Authority, Enterprise Singapore, Housing & Development Board, Singapore Tourism Board, Urban Redevelopment Authority, and Singapore Land Authority. You may refer to the resource reference at the Appendix. 24. The heightened measures that are imposed from 16 May 2021 to 13 June 2021 under Phase 2 (Heightened Alert), are necessary to curb the COVID-19 infections in Singapore. We seek your continued support and cooperation to remain vigilant and adhere to the safe management measures to protect the health and safety of your employees, RESs, clients and the community.Appendix of Annex to CEA Notice 13-21 LIST OF KEY GOVERNMENT MINISTRIES AND AGENCIES WITH GUIDANCE AND ADVISORIES RELEVANT TO THE REAL ESTATE AGENCY INDUSTRY [CEA] COVID-19 [MOH] [MTI] GoBusiness sg/ [MOM] Safe management measures at the workplace d-19/requirements-for-safe\u0002management-measures [ESG, HDB, STB and URA] Safe Management Measures: Retail Establishments and lifestyle\u0002related services esg.gov.sg/covid\u000219/safe-distance [BCA] Built Environment Sector COVID-19 Information D-19 [HDB] web/homepage [URA] orate [SLA]\n",
      "Updated guidelines for volunteer management during COVID-19 pandemic Note: This supersedes the earlier Guidelines for Volunteer Management during COVID-19 Pandemic, dated 7 May 2021. 17 May 2021 On 14 May 2021, the Multi-Ministry Taskforce (MTF) announced the need to tighten the measures introduced on 8 May 2021 to decisively arrest the increasing number of cases in the community. These measures will take effect from 16 May to 13 June 20211. This document provides guidance to individuals and organisations on their volunteering activities in Phase Two (Heightened Alert). Approach for Phase Two (Heightened Alert) Volunteers continue to play a key role in the fight against COVID-19. Their activities include promoting social responsibility, supporting essential services and caring for the vulnerable segments. In Phase Two (Heightened Alert), Volunteer Host Organisations (VHOs)2 can continue to enlist volunteers to support essential aid distribution (i.e. supplies necessary for daily sustenance e.g. cooked food and food rations, and urgent financial aid). With the tightening measures, volunteering associated with non-essential services will be suspended. For new activities involving essential aid distribution, VHOs should plan the modality to adhere with the prevailing safe management measures and submit to National Council of Social Service (NCSS) the following information of the activities via www.go.gov.sg/distributioncontact at least 3 working days before VHOs commence activities3. a) Name of VHO b) Person-in-charge and contact details c) List of staff and volunteers d) Number of beneficiaries served e) Type of essential aid (e.g. cooked meals, personal care products, vouchers) f) Modality and frequency of essential aid distribution g) Number of staff/ volunteers needed to distribute essential aid Apart from essential aid distribution, VHOs can also respond to other community needs so long as these activities adhere to safe management measures and guidelines for the specific sector4. Plans on essential aid distribution should also be submitted to NCSS. VHOs can conduct volunteer activities in groups of two persons with no inter-mingling between groups, and in accordance with safe management measures and sector guidelines. VHOs should also collaborate and coordinate with partners to minimise duplicative efforts, and reduce the movement of staff and volunteers and physical interactions. Avoid general outreach and door-to-door visitation, except for cases in need of urgent aid5. Notwithstanding the above, VHOs are strongly encouraged to carry out their volunteering activities remotely or in virtual format wherever possible, e.g. via telephone and video-conference. This is still the best way to keep our volunteers and beneficiaries safe. See Table 1 for a summary of the approach for volunteering activities. Table 1: Summary of the approach for volunteering activities Volunteering Activities Approach a. Volunteering activities supporting essential aid distribution Inform NCSS via this link www.go.gov.sg/distributioncontact, and adhere to safe management measures b. Volunteering activities to support other essential community needs Conduct volunteer activities, involving groups of up to any two persons, with no inter-mingling across groups, and adhere to safe management measures Assess risk and apply safe management measures VHOs must conduct volunteer activity risk assessment to assess the format for the activity and deployment of volunteers (See Annex A for an illustration). Should face-to-face interactions be necessary for volunteering activities, VHOs must ensure compliance with safe management measures. These measures include: a. As a default, measures should be put in place to ensure that individuals maintain safe distancing of at least one metre at all times; b. Where not feasible or practical to apply one metre safe distancing between individuals, this one metre requirement should be enforced between groups, with each group made up of no more than two persons, and with no mixing between groups. c. Ensure no cross deployment or social mixing among different groups of volunteers and schedule their volunteer activities, if possible, in fixed teams, to minimise interactions between volunteers and staff. d. Ensure staff and volunteers wear a mask at all times. Staff and volunteers should not participate if unwell. e. Encourage staff and volunteers to observe good personal hygiene, e.g. wash their hands regularly and refrain from touching their face. f. Avoid involving children, persons with chronic or underlying conditions, and pregnant women as volunteers. However, these individuals can take on virtual volunteer roles that allow them to operate from home. g. Limit the number and physical movement of staff and volunteers involved to minimise the risk of transmission. Implement staggered working and break hours and timings of volunteering sessions to reduce possible congregation at common spaces. Keep a register and track movement using a movement log, in order to facilitate contact tracing, if necessary. h. Reduce frequency and duration of physical interactions with beneficiaries, e.g. consolidate essential aid to be delivered to reduce the number of physical trips and avoid physical interactions by leaving supplies at the door. If there is a need to check on the beneficiaries, volunteers to maintain at least 1m safe distance. For beneficiaries who are seniors, deliver essential aid to their doorstep as far as possible, so that they do not have to venture out to do collection. i. Where it is not feasible to arrange for delivery, designated collection points can also be set up in the vicinity for beneficiaries to collect the essential aid with the necessary precautionary measures to ensure safe management. Buffet set-ups are strictly prohibited. Volunteers must not congregate and should minimise physical interaction with beneficiaries. j. Enable contact tracing to be carried out quickly and effectively by using the SafeEntry or TraceTogether-only SafeEntry system to log the check-in and check-out of staff and volunteers from premises. VHOs should ensure that they are ready to implement TraceTogether-only SafeEntry from 17 May 2021. This is a free-for-use service. Visit to sign up for SafeEntry NRIC or SafeEntry QR or for TraceTogether-only SafeEntry, and to refer to the user guidelines and FAQs. Upon registration, an onboarding guide with links to all the key resources, digital posters, step-by-step user guides and demo videos will be provided. k. Require staff and volunteers to download and activate the TraceTogether app. This will help MOH to more quickly identify potential close contacts of COVID-19 patients and reduce disease transmission. Data recorded by TraceTogether is stored on the user’s phone, and is only uploaded when required by MOH, e.g. when the user is suspected to have COVID-19. More information on TraceTogether can be found at Ensure safety and well-being of volunteers VHOs must continue to ensure the safety and well-being of their volunteers. The volunteers should be informed about the risks, and the measures taken by the VHO to protect them. This can include a briefing on the volunteer activity and precautionary measures, and shall be conducted remotely online, where possible. VHOs are to provide a contact number for volunteers to call in case of emergency or if they feel distressed. VHOs shall also actively seek feedback from volunteers and help to address their concerns, if any. Even with safe management measures and gradual resumption of activities, there is a risk that COVID-19 transmission may happen. VHOs must be prepared to help volunteers who have contracted COVID-19 in the line of duty. This can include helping them to apply for relief under The Courage Fund6, and to extend support for their families during this period of time. VHOs should also provide emotional support to any volunteer who needs it, and can tap on the National Care hotline. VHOs should also find ways to show their appreciation for their volunteers’ efforts, which can include sharing positive stories through the SG Cares App, providing words of encouragement, and tokens of appreciation. Sustain engagement of supporters and volunteers VHOs are strongly encouraged to continue to communicate and engage their supporters and volunteers during this period even if they are not deployed. This will allow VHOs to activate volunteer resources quickly when the situation improves. Activities by VHOs can include doing the following remotely: a. Keep supporters informed of the current happenings and initiatives; b. Share stories to motivate volunteers to step up; c. Encourage creative and safe ways to volunteer, both remotely and on-site; d. Build online communities and social networks; and e. Leverage online volunteer opportunities portals, communication tools and learning resources (See Annex B for a list of resources). These measures will be revised in tandem with future adjustments in MOH’s guidelines. Depending on the risk assessment and our safe management practices, MCCY will issue further advisories to guide VHOs on the management and deployment of volunteers. We need to remain cautious and stay safe as long as the risk of COVID-19 transmission remains. Working together to emerge stronger The community and volunteers shape a caring and united Singapore. With everyone playing their part and supporting each other, we can overcome this pandemic and emerge stronger. For enquiries For clarifications or enquiries, VHOs can write in to SGCares@mccy.gov.sg.

      "J OINT ADVISORY Page 1 of 4 MR No.: 034/21 Updated Safe Management Measures For Food & Beverage and Online Retail Delivery 1. The Multi-Ministry Taskforce (MTF) announced on 14 May 2021 that safe management measures will be further tightened to reduce the risk of community spread, with effect from 16 May through 13 June 2021. During this period, all Food & Beverage (F&B) establishments can only operate for takeaway and/or delivery. Dining-in is not permitted. In addition, online retail is encouraged for retail establishments to minimise in-store dwell time. These measures are to reduce physical interactions and risk of transmission within the community. 2. In line with this, Enterprise Singapore (ESG) and the Land Transport Authority (LTA) are providing operational guidance on safe management measures for businesses providing delivery services for F&B and retail establishments. This includes in-house delivery operations, third-party delivery businesses, as well as taxis and private-hire cars (PHCs)1 , which can continue to make grocery and food deliveries. All such delivery personnel must comply with these measures. The information in this document supersedes that in previous advisories or statements. Food Delivery 3. Companies providing food delivery services must comply with the following: 3.1. For delivery personnel 3.1.1. Wear masks at all times during their work. 3.1.2. Minimise contact and interactions with others at all times and not cluster together when waiting to collect food items or during breaks (not more than 2 persons in a group). This includes interactions with employees from F&B establishments, customers and other delivery personnel. 3.1.3. Comply with the one-metre distancing measure with other individuals, including other delivery personnel. If an F&B outlet is overcrowded, they should wait outside the establishment, maintain a safe distance from other delivery personnel or customers, and only enter the outlet when food is ready for collection. 3.2. For F&B establishments 3.2.1. Opt for contactless pick-up, where food orders are placed by the F&B establishment at designated locations for pick-up by delivery personnel. 1 In March 2020, LTA announced a temporary liberalisation of regulations to allow the use of taxis and PHCs for grocery and food deliveries. This arrangement will continue to be in place until end September 2021.Page 2 of 4 3.3. For customers 3.3.1. Opt for contactless receiving of food, where food orders are left by delivery personnel at designated locations (e.g. at the doorstep) for pick\u0002up by customers. Online Retail Delivery 4. Businesses providing online retail delivery services must comply with the following: 4.1. For delivery personnel 4.1.1. Wear masks at all times during their work. 4.1.2. Minimise contact and interactions with others at all times and not cluster together when waiting to collect items or during breaks (not more than 2 persons in a group). This includes interactions with employees from retail establishments, customers and other delivery personnel. 4.1.3. Comply with the one-metre distancing measure. They should only enter the retail establishment when the retail item is ready for collection. 4.1.4. Leave the premises as soon as bulk items have been put in place. 4.2. For retail establishments 4.2.1. Opt for contactless pick-up, where items are placed at designated locations for pick-up by delivery personnel. 4.2.2. For on-site installation, employees responsible for delivery and installation must comply with stringent hygiene and safe management measures, and leave the premises once installation is completed. The number of employees involved in the installation should be kept to no more than 2 workers. 4.3. For consumers 4.3.1. Opt for contactless receiving of items, where items are left by delivery personnel at designated locations (e.g. at the doorstep) for pick-up by customers. Contact Tracing 5. Delivery personnel are encouraged to download the TraceTogether mobile app or use a TraceTogether Token2 to facilitate contact tracing; this will help protect themselves and the community. 6. When entering establishments for collection of items, they must do their SafeEntry check-in (via TraceTogether-only SafeEntry) and temperature screening where required. 6.1. The following retail establishments are required to deploy SafeEntry: • Malls and large standalone stores; • Large retail stores > 930 sqm or 10,000 sqft; • Supermarkets; • Personal care services e.g. hairdressers, barbers, spas, beauty and wellness; and • Facilities providing basic pet services (that do not function on a drop-off, pick\u0002up basis). 2 For those using the TraceTogether Token, they are reminded to check the battery level. A green blinking light indicates that the Token is functioning properly whereas a red blinking light indicates that the battery is low. Page 3 of 4 6.2. Note that i) large retail stores > 930 sqm (or 10,000 sqft) and ii) supermarkets located within a TraceTogether-only SafeEntry building (e.g. malls) that have the same operating hours as the building are not required to deploy SafeEntry check\u0002in for customers, vendors and visitors (including delivery personnel). However, those located within a TraceTogether-only SafeEntry building but with longer operating hours must implement TraceTogether-only SafeEntry outside the building’s operating hours. 6.3. As per current practice, it is not necessary for delivery personnel to do SafeEntry check-in at F&B establishments. Cleanliness and hygiene measures 7. All delivery businesses must comply with the following: 7.1. Carry out daily temperature screening and health declaration among employees, including delivery personnel before they start work. Those who are unwell cannot work and must go to the doctor. 7.2. Ensure adoption of cleanliness and hygiene practices and compliance with MOH health advisories. 7.3. Delivery personnel who are eating or drinking in the course of their work must wear their masks immediately after doing so. They should dine alone, keep a distance of at least one metre from any other individual and refrain from interacting with other individuals. 7.4. Equip delivery personnel with hand sanitisers. Personnel must be reminded to wash their hands with soap and water regularly. In the event that they are unable to do so in between deliveries, they should keep their hands clean by using the hand sanitisers. 7.5. Delivery personnel must frequently clean carriers such as food carriers, food bags and food warmers for food delivery, and other forms of carriers and boxes for retail delivery. The frequency of cleaning and disinfection should be commensurate with increased usage. 7.6. Delivery personnel should not place their personal items (e.g. water bottles) in the same box, carrier, or insulated container, which are used to hold food ordered by customers. 7.7. Businesses can refer to NEA’s guidelines of Interim List of Household Products and Active Ingredients for Disinfection of the COVID-19 Virus for information3 . Businesses will need to ensure appropriate use of disinfectants and ensure they do not come into contact with food. 8. Employers, employees and delivery personnel must exercise social responsibility by observing good personal hygiene and monitoring their health conditions. Employees and delivery personnel must reduce physical interactions and not have meals in groups. Those who are unwell, even with mild flu-like symptoms, must see a doctor and stay at home to prevent spreading illness to others. Communications 9. All companies providing delivery services must provide clear communications and reminders to delivery personnel to ensure compliance with the above safe management and baseline sanitation and hygiene measures. 3 4 of 4 Enforcement of measures 10. Government agencies will be stepping up enforcement of these safe management measures. Under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act passed in Parliament on 7 April 2020, first-time offenders will face a fine of up to S$10,000, imprisonment of up to six months, or both. Subsequent offences may face a fine of up to S$20,000, imprisonment of up to twelve months, or both. 11. Businesses that do not implement or comply with the government’s safe management advisories may also be ineligible for government grants, loans, tax rebates and other assistance.

      "UPDATES ON LOCAL SITUATION AND HEIGHTENED ALERT TO MINIMISE TRANSMISSION 14TH MAY 2021 The Multi-Ministry Taskforce (MTF) has been closely monitoring the local and global COVID-19 situation. The number of locally transmitted COVID-19 cases and unlinked community cases has continued to increase. This is concerning as the situation could quickly escalate if these cases are not contained swiftly and decisively. Update on Local Situation 2. We have detected several clusters of infections emerging in the past 2 weeks around (i) an ICA officer and his extended family, (ii) Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH), (iii) Tuas South Community Care Facility, and (iv) Pasir Panjang Terminal. Most recently, we have an emerging cluster at Changi Airport Terminal 3 with a total of 46 cases to date. 3. To reduce the risk of any spread from undetected cases in the community, we have cast a wide net and taken swift action to detect, isolate, and ringfence any possible emerging transmissions to the community. We have carried out mass surveillance testing of persons with possible exposure to cases surrounding these clusters, such as TTSH patients and visitors who were at TTSH during the infectious period. Special testing operations have also been conducted to test port workers who had been deployed at Pasir Panjang Terminal, as well as workers at Changi Airport Terminals 1 and 3 and Jewel Changi Airport. Since 1 May 2021, we have also implemented additional pre-emptive measures to minimise interactions at both social settings and workplaces so as to break the chains of transmission to the community. These measures were further enhanced with effect from 8 May 2021, with reductions in the prevailing group size of social gatherings and the size of larger scale events or activities, to minimise the likelihood of large clusters forming. 4. However, a pattern of local unlinked community cases has emerged and is persisting. This is worrying as it suggests that there may be unknown cases in the community with possible ongoing community transmission and that our earlier and ongoing measures to break the chains of transmissions may be insufficient. We need to act decisively to contain these risks as any one leak could result in an uncontrolled resurgence of cases. Hence we will move to impose targeted restrictions on higher risk settings such as those where there is a high density of people who are unmasked for prolonged periods. Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) in the Fight Against COVID-19 5. Following the measures introduced on 8 May 2021, we need to tighten more measures to decisively arrest the increasing number of cases in the community. The following measures will take effect from Sunday 16 May 2021 through Sunday 13 June 2021. A) Further reductions in permissible group size 6. We will further reduce the current permissible group size of up to 5 persons to up to 2 persons, and the cap of 5 distinct visitors per household per day to 2 distinct visitors per household per day. Individuals should continue to limit their overall number of social gatherings to not more than 2 per day, whether to another household, or meeting with friends and family members in a public place. 7. In order to allow families’ current childcare arrangements to continue, grandchildren being cared for by their grandparents on a daily basis would not be counted towards the cap of 2 distinct visitors per household, or to the number of social gatherings per day. However grandparents are strongly encouraged to be vaccinated against COVID-19, to protect both themselves and their grandchildren from COVID-19 infection. To reduce the risk of transmission, grandparents should also minimise intermingling between grandchildren from different households. B) Minimising Workplace Interactions 8. Work-from-home will be the default at workplaces. Employers must ensure that employees who are able to work from home do so. There should continue to be no cross-deployment of workers to multiple worksites. Employers should continue to stagger start times of employees who need to return to the workplace and implement flexible working hours. Social gatherings at the workplace will not be allowed. Employees may have meal breaks at the workplace, but refrain from intermingling with their colleagues when their masks are taken off. These measures will lower transmission risks by reducing overall footfall and interactions at common spaces at or near the workplace, and in public places, including public transport. C) Cessation of Indoor “Mask-Off” Activities 9. The recent clusters have demonstrated higher attack rates and secondary transmission occur in mask-off settings, households, and at eateries. To reduce risks of community transmission, indoor “mask-off” activities such as dine-in F&B establishments will cease during this period. Other activities which will also not be allowed during this period include strenuous indoor exercise class or strenuous individual and group indoor sports and exercise activities. In addition, personalised services which require masks to be removed (e.g. facials and saunas), singing, and the playing of instruments that require intentional expulsion of air (e.g. wind or brass instruments) will also not be allowed. These restrictions will not apply to medical and dental consultations that require patients to have their masks off. Please see details in following paragraphs and in Annex A. 10. Cessation of Dine-in Food and Beverage (F&B). Dine-in F&B establishments are a higher-risk setting as customers often dine for prolonged periods in close proximity with one another with their masks-off. To reduce the risk of community transmission, dine-in F&B establishments (including hawker centres and foodcourts), both indoor and outdoor, will only be able to offer takeaway and delivery options. 11. Reduction of Activity and Event Sizes and Pre-Event Testing Requirements. To minimise the likelihood of large cluster formations, we will further scale down event sizes and lower the event size caps. Pre-event testing (PET) remains an essential measure to help ensure that events can proceed safely for attendees. More details on PET can be found on the MOH website. a. Congregational and other worship services. Congregational and other worship services may continue with a reduced capacity of 50 attendees at any one time without PET, or up to 100 attendees at any one time with PET implemented. To further mitigate the risk of spread through aerosol transmissions, religious workers and all other participants must wear their masks at all times. Live singing and playing of wind instruments will also be suspended during this period. b. Shopping malls and showrooms. The occupancy limits for shopping malls and showrooms will be further reduced from the current limit of 10sqm per person of Gross Floor Area (GFA), to 16sqm per person. Odd and even date entry restrictions on Sundays for popular malls will continue. c. Attractions and shows. The operating capacity of attractions that have received MTI’s prior approval will be reduced to 25% from the current permissible capacity of 50%. Indoor and outdoor shows may proceed with up to 100 persons with PET, and up to 50 persons without PET. d. Museums and public libraries. Museums and public libraries will be allowed to operate at a reduced capacity of 25%. e. Cinemas. Up to 100 persons may be allowed into cinema halls with PET implemented. Without PET, only up to 50 persons may be allowed. The prevailing group size of 2 persons applies, and food and beverages may not be sold or consumed in the cinema. f. MICE and live performances. Up to 100 persons may be allowed with PET, and up to 50 persons may be allowed without PET. Unmasking is not allowed for speakers and performers, and there should be no singing or playing of instruments that require intentional expulsion of air (e.g. wind and brass instruments). g. Wedding receptions and solemnisations. - In line with measures on dine-in F&B establishments, wedding receptions will not be allowed. - Marriage solemnisations may continue for up to 100 participants with PET and 50 participants without PET. h. Funerals. The cap for attendees applicable to all days of the funeral, including the burial/ cremation, is 20 persons or less, down from 30 persons currently. Attendees are reminded to maintain safe distancing and keep masks on at all times to reduce the risk of transmission. Targeted Support Measures A) Enhanced Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) Support for F&B Firms 12. In view of the cessation of dining-in at F&B establishments, the Government will increase the JSS support rate to 50% of the first $4,600 of gross monthly wages paid to local employees during the period for which dining-in is prohibited. This is an increase from the 10% support for wages paid up to June 2021. B) One-Month Rental Relief for Hawker Centres and Coffeeshops on Government-owned Premises 13. To support hawkers and coffeeshop stallholders, who are self-employed and do not benefit from the JSS, the Government will provide one month of rental waiver for hawker stall and coffeeshop tenants of Government agencies. Commercial landlords are urged to support their F&B tenants through this period. Use of Face Shields 14. Research has demonstrated that face shields cannot substitute masks in protecting the wearer from droplet infection. More importantly, face shields do not adequately prevent droplet spread if the wearer is infected. Face shields should therefore not be used as a substitute for mask wear, except for medical exceptions; or where the child is 12 years or younger; or for the marriage couple during the solemnisation of their marriage. Expansion of Testing Strategy 15. The above measures will continue to be complemented by our testing, contact tracing, and vaccination capabilities, that we have built up over the past year to manage community spread. Testing, in particular, is one of our key defensive tools to quickly identify individuals who have been exposed to the virus and reduce chances of further spread. Active surveillance and routine testing of targeted groups, such as those with higher risk of exposure to COVID-19, and testing for those diagnosed with Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI) with a COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test has enabled quick detection of unlinked cases in the community. For swifter detection of possible cases, we will be also begin Antigen Rapid Testing (ART) for all who present themselves with ARI symptoms at our Swab and Send Home (SASH) Public Health Preparedness Clinics (PHPCs), Polyclinics, Emergency Departments and Regional Swab Centres (RSCs). This ART will be done together with the PCR test that all such patients are already subjected to. Both the ART and PCR tests will be funded by the Government for all individuals with ARI symptoms. While the ART is less accurate than the PCR test, and there will be more false positives and false negatives, the ART’s quicker turnaround time compared to a PCR test1 will allow us to take any public health actions more quickly for persons who test positive by ART. 16. This enhanced testing regime will be rolled out progressively, starting with around 200 SASH PHPCs that are already licensed as ART providers from 15 May 2021, and will be expanded to include all SASH PHPCs through May alongside Polyclinics, Emergency Departments in hospitals, and RSCs. Along with our use of digital tools, such as the TraceTogether and SafeEntry programme, these measures will enable us to quickly identify and draw wide rings around cases and their close contacts. Keeping our Vulnerable and Community Safe 17. Vaccination remains critical in our fight against the pandemic. We have continued to make steady progress with our vaccination programme, having started with our most vulnerable, such as healthcare workers, elderly, and workers with high risks of exposure to COVID-19. As of 13 May 2021, we have administered more than 3.2 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine. About 1.9 million individuals have received at least one dose of the vaccine, of whom about 1.3 million individuals have received their second dose and completed the full vaccination regimen. 18. The recent cases illustrate that vaccination may not eliminate the risks of infection completely. However it provides significant protection against infections and helps to reduce the severity of the disease and onward transmission. Vaccination thus remains a key enabler and its ability to help us re-open safely can only be felt when we achieve a high level of population coverage for vaccination. Hence, we urge everyone to be vaccinated when it is offered to you. Observe all safe management measures, see a doctor, and get tested if you feel unwell. It is only together, that we can emerge stronger and safer. MINISTRY OF HEALTH 14 MAY 2021\n"
