Advisory to employers - Additional measures in line with Phase 2 (Heightened Alert)
Issued on 17 May 2021

Additional Measures in line with Phase 2 (Heightened Alert)

To better protect our migrant workers (MWs) living in dormitories from being exposed to COVID-19 in the community, the Ministry of Manpower will implement additional measures for them from 17 May 2021. These measures are in response to the community measures introduced on 14 May for Phase 2 (Heightened Alert).

Suspension of Safe Rest Day Visits to Recreation Centres
Visits to the Recreation Centres for Safe Rest Days will be suspended temporarily until further notice. We are currently exploring arrangements to allow visits to Recreation Centres in a safe and controlled manner during this Phase of heightened alert and will update in due course. This measure is to mitigate the risk of them being exposed to possible infection and subsequently infecting others in their dormitories. MWs will still be allowed to carry out essential errands, including reporting sick if they are unwell. MWs who are found to have acted irresponsibly may face further actions such as having their work passes revoked.

Use of Communal Dormitory Facilities
In line with the national measures during this period, all the gyms, beer gardens and communal dining facilities within the dormitories will need to be closed, and canteens can only offer takeaway services (i.e. no dining in). MOM will step up enforcement on the compliance to Safe Management Measures during this period.
All activities within the dormitories are to be capped at the permissible group size of up to two persons. You should remind your MWs to continue to adhere to the appropriate Safe Management Measures within their dormitories.

No Change to Work, RRT and Vaccination Appointments
There will be no changes to the work arrangements for your MWs. They will be able to continue to go to work if they have a green AccessCode. Employers are reminded to continue to arrange dedicated transport arrangements for your MWs, at staggered pick-up and drop-off timings to and from the worksites. Please continue to ensure proper Safe Management Measures at your worksites to minimise inter-mixing.
Your MWs will also be allowed to leave their dormitories to attend their Rostered Routine Testing (RRT) and vaccination appointments. Employers are required to arrange dedicated transport arrangements for your MWs and ensure that your MWs adhere to their assigned groupings, to restrict intermixing.

Responsibilities as employers
Food and salary. Employers are responsible for the upkeep and maintenance of your MWs’ well-being. Please continue to make the necessary arrangements to ensure that your MWs are paid and given proper food during this period. Please note that your MWs should still receive their salary if they are placed on movement restriction or quarantine.
Infection, Prevention, and Control Measures. Remind your MWs not to go to work if they feel unwell and seek medical care. Please inform your MWs to comply with the Safe Living and Infection Prevention Control (IPC) Measures, including:
Dos	Don’ts
Wear a mask correctly, covering nose and mouth at all times.
Maintain good personal hygiene, including washing their hands with soap and water frequently.
Use hand sanitizers after coming into contact with high touch areas, such as ATMs.
Maintain 1 metre safe distance.
Seek medical help if they are feeling unwell, via telemedicine on FWMOMCareApp. Inform the dormitory operator or employer to provide a dedicated transport to the regional medical centre. For emergencies, call 995.
Do not intermix with other MWs working in different zones at your worksite or residing in other floors or layers in the dormitories.
Do not go to work when unwell.
As this may be a difficult period for your MWs, we encourage that you continue to engage them to provide them with emotional and mental support. During this period, we will also be disseminating care packs, including masks and hand sanitisers to them. You may refer to Annex A for more information on the support you can provide to your MWs. If you find your MW(s) in emotional distress, please encourage them to call these helplines for help:
