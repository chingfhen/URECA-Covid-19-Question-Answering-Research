Updated Safe Management Measures For Food & Beverage and Online Retail Delivery
1. The Multi-Ministry Taskforce (MTF) announced on 14 May 2021 that safe management 
measures will be further tightened to reduce the risk of community spread, with effect 
from 16 May through 13 June 2021. During this period, all Food & Beverage (F&B) 
establishments can only operate for takeaway and/or delivery. Dining-in is not permitted. 
In addition, online retail is encouraged for retail establishments to minimise in-store dwell 
time. These measures are to reduce physical interactions and risk of transmission within 
the community. 
2. In line with this, Enterprise Singapore (ESG) and the Land Transport Authority (LTA) are 
providing operational guidance on safe management measures for businesses providing 
delivery services for F&B and retail establishments. This includes in-house delivery 
operations, third-party delivery businesses, as well as taxis and private-hire cars
(PHCs)1
, which can continue to make grocery and food deliveries. All such delivery 
personnel must comply with these measures. The information in this document 
supersedes that in previous advisories or statements.
Food Delivery
3. Companies providing food delivery services must comply with the following: 
3.1. For delivery personnel
3.1.1. Wear masks at all times during their work.
3.1.2. Minimise contact and interactions with others at all times and not cluster 
together when waiting to collect food items or during breaks (not more 
than 2 persons in a group). This includes interactions with employees
from F&B establishments, customers and other delivery personnel. 
3.1.3. Comply with the one-metre distancing measure with other individuals, 
including other delivery personnel. If an F&B outlet is overcrowded, they 
should wait outside the establishment, maintain a safe distance from 
other delivery personnel or customers, and only enter the outlet when 
food is ready for collection. 
3.2. For F&B establishments 
3.2.1. Opt for contactless pick-up, where food orders are placed by the F&B 
establishment at designated locations for pick-up by delivery personnel.

In March 2020, LTA announced a temporary liberalisation of regulations to allow the use of taxis and PHCs for 
grocery and food deliveries. This arrangement will continue to be in place until end September 2021.Page 2 of 4
3.3. For customers
3.3.1. Opt for contactless receiving of food, where food orders are left by 
delivery personnel at designated locations (e.g. at the doorstep) for pickup by customers. 
Online Retail Delivery
4. Businesses providing online retail delivery services must comply with the following: 
4.1. For delivery personnel
4.1.1. Wear masks at all times during their work.
4.1.2. Minimise contact and interactions with others at all times and not cluster 
together when waiting to collect items or during breaks (not more than 2 
persons in a group). This includes interactions with employees from retail 
establishments, customers and other delivery personnel. 
4.1.3. Comply with the one-metre distancing measure. They should only enter 
the retail establishment when the retail item is ready for collection. 
4.1.4. Leave the premises as soon as bulk items have been put in place.
4.2. For retail establishments 
4.2.1. Opt for contactless pick-up, where items are placed at designated 
locations for pick-up by delivery personnel. 
4.2.2. For on-site installation, employees responsible for delivery and 
installation must comply with stringent hygiene and safe management 
measures, and leave the premises once installation is completed. The 
number of employees involved in the installation should be kept to no 
more than 2 workers.
4.3. For consumers 
4.3.1. Opt for contactless receiving of items, where items are left by delivery 
personnel at designated locations (e.g. at the doorstep) for pick-up by 
customers. 
Contact Tracing 
5. Delivery personnel are encouraged to download the TraceTogether mobile app or use a 
TraceTogether Token2
to facilitate contact tracing; this will help protect themselves and 
the community. 
6. When entering establishments for collection of items, they must do their SafeEntry 
check-in (via TraceTogether-only SafeEntry) and temperature screening where required. 
6.1. The following retail establishments are required to deploy SafeEntry:
• Malls and large standalone stores;
• Large retail stores > 930 sqm or 10,000 sqft; 
• Supermarkets; 
• Personal care services e.g. hairdressers, barbers, spas, beauty and wellness; 
and
• Facilities providing basic pet services (that do not function on a drop-off, pickup basis). 
2 For those using the TraceTogether Token, they are reminded to check the battery level. A green blinking light 
indicates that the Token is functioning properly whereas a red blinking light indicates that the battery is low. Page 3 of 4
6.2. Note that i) large retail stores > 930 sqm (or 10,000 sqft) and ii) supermarkets
located within a TraceTogether-only SafeEntry building (e.g. malls) that have the 
same operating hours as the building are not required to deploy SafeEntry checkin for customers, vendors and visitors (including delivery personnel). However, 
those located within a TraceTogether-only SafeEntry building but with longer 
operating hours must implement TraceTogether-only SafeEntry outside the 
building’s operating hours.
6.3. As per current practice, it is not necessary for delivery personnel to do SafeEntry 
check-in at F&B establishments.
Cleanliness and hygiene measures
7. All delivery businesses must comply with the following:
7.1. Carry out daily temperature screening and health declaration among employees, 
including delivery personnel before they start work. Those who are unwell cannot 
work and must go to the doctor.
7.2. Ensure adoption of cleanliness and hygiene practices and compliance with MOH 
health advisories. 
7.3. Delivery personnel who are eating or drinking in the course of their work must 
wear their masks immediately after doing so. They should dine alone, keep a 
distance of at least one metre from any other individual and refrain from 
interacting with other individuals.
7.4. Equip delivery personnel with hand sanitisers. Personnel must be reminded to 
wash their hands with soap and water regularly. In the event that they are unable 
to do so in between deliveries, they should keep their hands clean by using the 
hand sanitisers.
7.5. Delivery personnel must frequently clean carriers such as food carriers, food 
bags and food warmers for food delivery, and other forms of carriers and boxes 
for retail delivery. The frequency of cleaning and disinfection should be 
commensurate with increased usage. 
7.6. Delivery personnel should not place their personal items (e.g. water bottles) in 
the same box, carrier, or insulated container, which are used to hold food ordered 
by customers.
7.7. Businesses can refer to NEA’s guidelines of Interim List of Household Products 
and Active Ingredients for Disinfection of the COVID-19 Virus for information3
.
Businesses will need to ensure appropriate use of disinfectants and ensure they 
do not come into contact with food. 
8. Employers, employees and delivery personnel must exercise social responsibility by 
observing good personal hygiene and monitoring their health conditions. Employees and 
delivery personnel must reduce physical interactions and not have meals in groups. 
Those who are unwell, even with mild flu-like symptoms, must see a doctor and stay at 
home to prevent spreading illness to others. 
Communications
9. All companies providing delivery services must provide clear communications and 
reminders to delivery personnel to ensure compliance with the above safe management 
and baseline sanitation and hygiene measures.

measures. Under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act passed in Parliament
