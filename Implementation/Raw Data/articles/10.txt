i got my shot to protect my loved ones at the community Unsure if you should be taking the COVID-19 vaccines? Hear from frontliners Kathryn, Mastura and Abdul Lathiff, who had their fair share of initial fears, but still decided to get vaccinated to protect themselves, their loved ones and the community. Read their stories below:“This pandemic has changed our lives drastically and almost everything we do here at PCF Sparkletots. While some semblance of normalcy has been restored with the resumption of physical classes, things are not as they were before.This was one of my motivations to get vaccinated.As the Executive Principal of the preschool centre, I’m in frequent contact with my staff, parents and students. I know that I’ve a social responsibility to protect those around me, especially the children who cannot be vaccinated. All of us have the responsibility to protect those who cannot take the vaccine due to age or certain medical conditions.Even though I was a little apprehensive about taking the COVID-19 vaccine due to my hypertension, my fears were alleviated after I consulted with my doctor. He assured me that the vaccines were safe, which gave me the extra resolve to put my foot forward.If someone tells me that they will ‘wait and see’ before taking the vaccine, I will ask them ‘Why wait and see, when you can take it now to protect yourself and your loved ones?’If you are medically fit, take the COVID-19 vaccine. If not for yourself, do it for your loved ones.”– Kathryn Goy, 54, Executive Principal of PAP Community Foundation (PCF) Sparkletots and Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) Fellow“I’ve always suffered from frequent and chronic coughs. When the first COVID-19 vaccine was approved in Singapore, I had just been discharged from the hospital after recuperating from a lung infection.Even then, I knew that I had to take the vaccine when it was offered to me. As I had existing health problems, my family was very worried about potential long-term side effects, and repeatedly asked me if I was sure about my decision.Although I had some worries at the start, I asked myself, ‘Why am I afraid? I am doing this for my health, and for my family’s health. If I get COVID-19, my family may get it as well. I want to do it for them.’As a healthcare worker, I also wanted to set a good example to show my patients that COVID-19 vaccines are safe. I knew that before I could take care of patients, I had to first take care of myself. When I informed the nurse at the vaccination centre of my medical conditions, she assured me that I was medically fit to take the vaccine.After the vaccination, I only had mild side effects from the second dose which were easily and quickly managed. Having been assured through my experience, my family members also decided to get vaccinated. My husband, who has hypertension, just completed both doses of the vaccine.Protect yourself, and your loved ones. I got my shot, get yours too!”– Mastura Binti Mohamad, 54, Senior Patient Service Associate in Sengkang General Hospital“I really miss interacting freely with passengers and my fellow colleagues. Life has not been the same since. There were many days where I have felt discouraged. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the transport industry tremendously. During Circuit Breaker, our ridership went down quite a bit. We also had to intensify various safety precautions for our passengers, such as disinfecting high-touch points and sanitising our buses twice a day.That’s why I was happy to hear about the COVID-19 vaccines. I believe that the vaccine will protect myself, my loved ones and my passengers.I was one of the first Bus Captains to sign up for the vaccination. I chose to go for the first available slot to instill confidence and encourage my fellow colleagues and union members to do the same. As a frontliner, it is also my duty to protect myself so I can protect the passengers I meet daily.All of us have a role to play in the fight against COVID-19. Even though there is a small chance that a vaccinated person can still get infected, the risk of them falling very sick is greatly reduced!We should all take the vaccination to protect ourselves and those around us!”– Abdul Lathiff Mohamed Rafi, 48, Senior Bus Captain at SBS Transit and Ulu Pandan Bus Depot Union Leader________________________________________________________________________________________#IGotMyShotSG is a campaign that encourages Singaporeans to get their COVID-19 vaccine when it’s available to them.
