i got my shot to stay protected from covid 19 Is it safe to take the COVID-19 vaccine with underlying medical conditions? Hear more from Larry Ong, a cancer survivor with multiple drug allergies, and Mohd Isa, a diabetic patient undergoing weekly dialysis. Both Larry and Isa had the go-ahead from their doctors to be vaccinated, after a brief consultation on their medical history. If you are unsure of your COVID-19 vaccination eligibility, remember to consult your doctors or check with the medical staff at your vaccination site!“I was initially rejected for the COVID-19 vaccine. Not because of my medical conditions, but because I’m allergic to 3 drugs – 2 are painkillers (Synflex and Ibuprofen), and the other is a high blood pressure medication (Lisinopril). When I take these drugs, I get a face rash.However, I was still keen to get vaccinated to be protected from COVID-19.I was hoping to be eligible despite taking medication for high blood pressure and high cholesterol for the past 10 years. I also had 2nd stage Thymoma cancer but it is now in remission.With that in mind, I thought that I should go to the vaccination centre to check with the nurse. After I went, they asked me if I had breathlessness when the allergy was triggered. I said no I didn’t, so they said ok, I can go for it.After the jabs, I had some mild side effects – an arm ache for a couple of days. But everything has settled and I feel fine now.No matter if you’re young or old, it’s still better to get vaccinated. We don’t know when this virus will hit us, maybe even from the person closest to you.Let’s protect ourselves, our families and our friends.”– Larry Ong, 68, retiree and cancer-survivor“I’ve had kidney problems since 2017. There was nothing much else the doctor could do. I remember he said, ‘Your kidneys – gone already’. Now I go for dialysis three times a week at the National Kidney Foundation (NKF) centre.I’m also diabetic and I take my insulin medication twice a day - once in the morning, once at night.Despite my medical conditions, I took the second dose of my COVID-19 vaccination about 3 weeks ago. It was ok, just a small pinch when the nurse injected me.Before going, I asked my kidney doctor at the NKF whether I should go. She knows my medical reports and history, and she said, ‘If you feel ok, you should go’.When I was at the vaccination centre, the doctors checked again. They asked me ‘Everything ok, no allergy?’ I went through screening and they said I could take it.Some people talk about getting fever from the vaccine. I tell my friends, ‘Don’t be scared, you can take a Panadol to feel better.’ It’s been good so far, I don’t have much problems.Whenever my friends and I catch up at the kopitiam, we’d say, “since the Government give you free (vaccination), better go! Protect yourself!"– Mohd Isa, 69, undergoes weekly dialysis due to kidney issues and has diabetes________________________________________________________________________________________#IGotMyShotSG is a campaign that encourages Singaporeans to get their COVID-19 vaccine when it’s available to them.
