Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - KK Women's and Children's Hospital (KKH) has started inoculating pregnant patients against Covid-19, with the first six women getting their jabs on Tuesday (June 8). The move comes after the Health Ministry (MOH) announced that it would allow pregnant women to book vaccination appointments from June 4, following a review of real-world clinical data of vaccination in this group. The ministry added that women should discuss vaccination with their doctors, even though there is currently no evidence to suggest that either the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine could harm pregnant women or their babies. This is because the amount of data collected for this group \"is still much smaller compared to data on the general population\", it said. Associate Professor Tan Hak Koon, who chairs KKH's obstetrics and gynaecology division, said women who are in at least their 13th week of pregnancy are eligible for vaccination. The jabs will be spaced at least two weeks apart from other vaccinations that they typically receive during pregnancy, such as the influenza and whooping cough jabs. They are being administered in hospital, rather than at vaccination centres in the community, so that obstetricians are on hand to advise the women about vaccination and monitor them after their jabs. Pregnant women who contract Covid-19 are more likely to develop severe symptoms, which may result in them being warded in the intensive care unit or put on oxygen therapy, Prof Tan added. Their babies also face an increased chance of being stillborn or born early, although the overall risks remain relatively low. For instance, one British study of more than 340,000 women found that 12 per cent of those who tested positive for Covid-19 when admitted to give birth had premature babies, compared with 5.8 per cent who were clear of the virus. One of those who was vaccinated at KKH on Tuesday was 28-year-old Suzanna Farid Tang Shu Ling, who is 26 weeks pregnant with her second child. The founder of ground-up initiative Urban Origins decided to do so after reading up about the increased risk of severe illness that infected pregnant women face, as well as the potential protection vaccination might confer on her unborn child. \"At the session, there were many doctors and nurses around,\" she said. \"At any point in time, if I had a question, I could just speak to one of them.\" Another expectant mother, childcare teacher Noriyah Abdul Rahman, said she chose to get vaccinated to protect herself and her unborn child. \"At first, I was frightened of what to expect after the vaccination - if I would have any immediate reaction,\" said the 43-year-old, who has a drug allergy. But the vaccination process went smoothly, she added. KKH is also looking to study whether antibodies produced by the mother after vaccination are transferred to the baby, a phenomenon that has been reported overseas. \"By right, the baby should have some passive protection from Covid-19,\" Prof Tan said. \"The question is: How much is transferred, whether this really gives protection, and for how long?\" Join ST's Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.

          "context": "delta variant of covid 19 could have contributed to spread at wet markets experts Read 3 articles daily and stand to win ST rewards, including the ST News Tablet worth $398. Spin the wheel for ST Read and Win now. SINGAPORE - Wet markets can fit a large number of people in a compact space and people have continued to flock to them even during the recent period of heightened alert. It is not surprising, therefore, that Covid-19 cases have surfaced there, said experts. The increased number of cases recently might also be due to a variant of Covid-19 that spreads more easily, they added. The cluster at 115 Bukit Merah View Market and Hawker Centre is linked to 56 cases, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) on Thursday (June 17), making it the third-largest open cluster. Precautions have also been taken at other wet markets after positive cases were found. Stallholders at the nearby Redhill Market and Food Centre had to undergo mandatory Covid-19 tests earlier this week. Testing was also conducted for people working at the Telok Blangah Drive Food Centre and Market, which has been closed for disinfection till Friday. Associate Professor Alex Cook, vice-dean of research at the National University of Singapore's (NUS) Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, said some wet markets may be quite compact relative to the number of visitors, which would heighten the risk of spread, even with natural ventilation. He said the recent wet market clusters have a mix of three types of cases: those who work in the market or at a stall, those who visit the market, and household contacts of a case connected to the market. The household contacts were not really infected because of the market per se, even though they are epidemiologically linked to the market clusters, he said. \"So the risk of infection within a wet market isn't quite as high as it may appear from the size of these clusters,\" he added. Professor Paul Tambyah, president of the Asia-Pacific Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infection, said the spread in open-air wet markets suggests that airborne transmission is indeed rare as most authorities agree - for all strains of the virus. As for whether wet markets should be avoided, he said: \"The key has to be vaccination. That is how every single viral disease from smallpox to measles to polio has been controlled.\" A possible link has been established between the Bukit Merah and Telok Blangah markets. MOH said on Monday that a Singaporean man, 42, who works as a hawker at the Telok Blangah food centre is a family member of another Singaporean man, 47, who works as a cooking assistant at the Bukit Merah market. An infected person had also visited the Redhill Market and Food Centre from June 8 to 10, according to MOH data. Professor Teo Yik Ying, dean of the NUS' Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, said it is highly likely that the cases at the Bukit Merah and Redhill markets are linked, given their proximity to each other. He added that malls and supermarkets have been where outbreaks were detected recently. \"I do not see them as a new weak link, but rather as a consequence of Singapore having to deal with a much more infectious Delta variant that is driving these outbreaks.\" Recent evidence from Britain has suggested that the Delta variant has a reproductive number of five to eight, which is much higher than the wild-type variant that the world saw early last year, with an R0 of two to three, he said. The reproductive number, or R0, of a virus is a measure of its transmission, or the number of new infections generated by each case. An R0 rate of 1, for example, means on average each infected person will infect one other person they come in contact with. The MOH told The Straits Times earlier this month that as at the end of May, 550 Covid-19 cases in Singapore were infected with the Delta variant of the coronavirus first detected in India. The number included 428 local cases, and 122 imported ones. Prof Teo said the increased transmissibility of the Delta variant means there is a possibility of a large outbreak event happening whenever infected cases are moving about in the community. \"If these cases were going to work or going about their social activities, then I expect the venues that are associated with the large outbreaks will be linked to workplaces or public spaces for social activities. \"But precisely because the default continues to be working from home and social activities are kept to a minimum now, people are frequenting malls, supermarkets, and wet markets for necessities and food. This is why we are seeing outbreaks in such venues,\" he said. Residents in Telok Blangah and Bukit Merah have expressed concern about the growing number of cases in the neighbourhood, as well as people who do not comply with safety rules. Compliance officer Gideon Goh, 37, who lives in Bukit Merah, told The Straits Times that he hadseenelderly people smoking or talking in groups in his neighbourhood, with masks that are not properly worn. Mr Goh, who recently reported such behaviour via the OneService app, said: \"While we can report such non-compliant behaviour, if you want to avoid conflict, there's not very much that you can do apart from avoiding these people.\" He added: \"I think it also takes a little bit more of a community effort. If there is a stronger sense of frowning upon certain behaviour by passers-by, then they know that they are in the minority and are more likely to follow the rules,\" he said.

These include but are not limited to: karaoke rooms, bars predominantly serving alcoholic drinks, and disco rooms. Relevant Government agencies will provide updates subsequently on when and how these activities can resume. Safe Management Measures (SMMs) 3 Country and recreation clubs must deploy SafeEntry (at the entrance to the club as well as for individual facilities where SafeEntry is required to be deployed as indicated on ) for employees, vendors, associates, members, and visitors, and safe management principlesrequirements for F&B and retail outlets, requirements for sports and physical activities, and work-related events, and any other relevant requirement or guidelines by Government agencies on safe management measures1 for the resumption of services: a. Individuals to maintain safe distancing of at least 1 metre at all times; b. Where the 1 metre safe distancing between individuals is not feasible or practical, it can be applied between groups, with each group made up of not more than 8 persons, and with no mixing or interaction between groups. c. If the activities involve exercising or playing of sports, then a longer safe distance of 2-3 metres must be maintained. For details, crequirements for sports facilities and activities. 1 As found on 4 Clubs must also adopt the following safe management measures (SMMs) to mitigate the risk of transmission between facility users: a. All facilities and shared areas must be frequently cleaned and disinfected. Equipment should be thoroughly wiped down and cleaned. Indoor spaces should be kept well-ventilated. For non-air conditioned spaces, windows should be kept open and additional fans should be put in place where possible. Clubs must ensure that the safe distancing principles at para 3 are observed, in order to limit close contact among individuals. b. Sports facilities (e.g. hard courts, gyms/fitness studios, swimming pools) must have capacity limits to avoid crowdedness and minimise the risk of large clusters forming: (i) For any such facility that is larger than 64 square metres, the maximum capacity must be limited to 1 person per 8 square metres of usable area or 50 persons, whichever is lower; (ii) For facilities smaller than 64 square metres, the maximum capacity must be limited to 8 persons; (iii) Beyond the overall capacity limits for facilities, greater attention should also be paid in controlling the usage of shared areas like common bathrooms and changing rooms to prevent crowding. c. Function rooms and event facilities can be used for marriage solemnisations, wedding receptions, wakes and funerals, training/classes, and work-related events. (i) Subject to the capacity limit of the room or facility and safe distancing measures, up to 100 persons (including the wedding couple and family, but excluding the marriage solemniser and vendors/venue staff) may be allowed in the room or facility for marriage solemnisations or wedding receptions. If there are more than 50 attendees, attendees must be split into zones or time slots comprising no more than 50 persons each. Details of the SMMs applicable can be found under . (ii) Subject to the capacity limit of the room or facility and safe distancing measures, up to 30 persons (excluding funeral workers and vendors/venue staff) may be allowed in the room or facility at any point in time for wakes and funerals. Refer 2 for funerals for details on the measures to be put in place. (iii) Subject to the capacity limit of the room or facility, it may also be used for training/classes provided by permitted training providers or instructors as set out on the GoBusiness portal (), up to a total of 50 persons (including any instructors). All individuals must maintain a safe distance of 1 metre at all times, and where this is not feasible or practical, individuals may be grouped in groups of no more than 8 persons, with no mixing or interactions between groups. (iv) Subject to the capacity limit of the room or facility, it may also be used for work-related events of up to 50 persons (excluding club staff). Details of the SMM requirements for work-related events can be found here: 2 -services/public-cleanliness/environmental-cleaning-guidelines/post-circuit-breaker-measures/frequently-asked-questions -19/requirements-for-safe-management-measures. (v) For individuals who wish to book the room or facility for their own use, or all other purposes, the gathering must not exceed 8 persons. Clubs must ensure that the use of the function rooms and event facilities are in line with the maximum permissible group size as set out in the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations 2020. 5 Examples of how clubs can implement the SMMs include using a booking system to manage the number of individuals using a facility at any one time, or using CCTV surveillance or patrolling security (where available) to monitor the use of common facilities. Rules that Individuals Must Comply With 6 Clubs should also remind members and visitors that only small-group social gatherings of up to any 8 persons are allowed within the grounds and shared facilities. 7 All individuals, including staff, members and visitors, must continue to wear a mask when using facilities within the club premises. Masks can be taken off when undertaking strenuous activities, such as running, jogging, brisk walking, cycling and other similar activities. Individuals must put their masks back on after completing the strenuous exercise.",

          "context": "7Jan-AdvisoryonEssentialAidDistribution\nPage 1 of 5 7 January 2021 Advisory on Essential Aid Distribution Against COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) 1. As we have made good progress on the key enablers supporting further resumption of activities, the Multi-Ministry Taskforce will start Phase Three of re-opening from 28 December 2020. Even as we cross this milestone, we must continue to remain vigilant in the coming months and avoid an uncontrolled resurgence of cases which could slow or even reverse our progress. Please refer to the press release issued on 14 Dec 2020 for details: -highlights/details/moving-into-phase-three-of-re-opening 2. The community and volunteers continue to play a key role in the fight against COVID-19. Their activities include promoting social responsibility, supporting essential services and caring for the vulnerable segments. From 19 June 2020, SSAs and community groups distributing essential aid (i.e. supplies necessary for daily sustenance e.g. cooked food and food rations, and urgent financial aid) to vulnerable persons and families may continue their activities. As we resume more activities in Phase Three, it is critical that we exercise caution and adhere to safe management measures to ensure that community transmission remains low. Social service agencies (SSAs) and community groups providing aid are strongly encouraged to limit face-to-face interventions to more critical cases. 3. SSAs and groups distributing essential aid should plan the modality of essential aid distribution to adhere with strict safe management measures and submit to National Council of Social Service (NCSS) the following information via this link www.go.gov.sg/distributioncontact at least 3 working days before SSAs/community groups commence activities: i. Name of SSA or community group; ii. Person-in-charge and contact details; iii. List of staff and volunteers; iv. Number of beneficiaries served; v. Type of essential aid being distributed (e.g. cooked meals, personal care products, vouchers); vi. Modality and frequency of essential aid distribution; and vii. Number of staff/volunteers needed to distribute essential aid. Page 2 of 5 4. For non-urgent cases, SSAs and community groups providing aid are encouraged to engage known aid recipients remotely (via telephone, online, video-conference) to check on their well-being, and provide a contact number for them to seek urgent help where necessary. 5. Should face-to-face intervention be necessary in order to provide essential aid, SSAs and community groups should: i. Limit the number and physical movement of staff and volunteers involved. Keep a register and track movement using a movement log, in order to facilitate contact tracing, if necessary. ii. Reduce frequency and duration of physical interactions with beneficiaries. Consolidate essential aid to be delivered to reduce the number of physical trips. Avoid physical interactions by leaving supplies at the door. If physical interactions are unavoidable, limit interactions to short durations with minimal physical contact and maintain safe distance of at least 1m from beneficiaries e.g. at the gate. iii. Observe strict safe management measures, including for backend activities such as food preparation and packing of supplies, and ensure staff and volunteers wear a mask. They should not participate if unwell. iv. Avoid involving children, persons with chronic or underlying conditions, and pregnant women as volunteers. v. Deliver essential aid to seniors to their doorstep as far as possible, so that they do not have to venture out to do collection. vi. Limit essential aid distribution to vulnerable persons in the community who are existing beneficiaries. General door-to-door outreach should be done remotely, where possible. vii. Transfer financial aid via electronic means, where possible. If that is not possible, cash can be delivered to the beneficiaries. Cash can also be delivered together with other essential aid. 6. SSAs and community groups should ensure no social mixing among different groups of staff/volunteers, and schedule their activities in fixed teams to avoid cross-interactions between groups. The need for and duration of physical interactions should be strictly reduced. More details on the precautionary and safe management measures can be found in Annex A. 7. SSAs and community groups that are unable to comply with the advisory should not proceed with your activities so as to safeguard the health and safety of your staff, Page 3 of 5 volunteers and beneficiaries. Please contact NCSS to make alternative arrangements for the vulnerable groups that you serve. For seniors requiring assistance, please contact the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) Hotline at 1800-650-6060. SSAs and community groups that encounter Singaporeans who require social assistance can contact ComCare Call at 1800-222-0000. 8. SSAs and community groups that require any assistance or clarifications on precautionary measures to be put in place can contact NCSS at CHUA_Yi_Xian@ncss.gov.sg. Page 4 of 5 ANNEX A Precautionary and Safe Management Measures In addition to the precautionary measures in Paras 5 to 6, SSAs and community groups should implement the following precautionary measures for essential aid distribution activities. Precautionary Measures for Staff/Volunteers Remind staff/volunteers prior to the start of the activity that they are not to attend or participate in the activity if they are unwell, have travelled overseas in the last 14 days or are under Quarantine, Leave of Absence (LOA)/Stay Home Notice (SHN) (pre-screening measures). Brief staff/volunteers of the precautionary measures implemented by the SSA or community group. Administer temperature screening and health/travel declarations of staff/ volunteers. Turn away staff/volunteers who are unwell, have recent travel history or are under Quarantine/LOA/SHN. Provide a clean and well-ventilated environment for staff/volunteers and ensure a safe distance of at least 1 metre between persons at all times. Encourage personal social responsibility among staff/volunteers o Practice good personal hygiene (i.e. washing of hands and using tissues when sneezing or coughing) o Adjust social norms (e.g. avoiding handshakes, hugging, etc.) Require staff/volunteers to inform the SSA or community group if they were later found to have been in contact with persons confirmed to have COVID-19, or if they have fallen ill after the activity. To enable contact tracing to be carried out quickly and effectively, all workplaces and facilities used for backend activities (e.g. food preparation, packing) must use the SafeEntry or TraceTogether-only SafeEntry system to log the check-in and check-out of staff/volunteers from premises. This is a free-for-use service. Visit to sign up for SafeEntry NRIC or SafeEntry QR or for TraceTogether-only SafeEntry, and to refer to the user guidelines and FAQs. Upon registration, an onboarding guide with links Page 5 of 5 to all the key resources, digital posters, step-by-step user guides and demo videos will be provided. Staff/volunteers should download and activate the TraceTogether app. This will help MOH to more quickly identify potential close contacts of COVID-19 patients and reduce disease transmission. Data recorded by TraceTogether is stored on device, and is shared with MOH for contact-tracing purposes when the user is suspected/confirmed to have COVID-19. More information on TraceTogether can be found at www.tracetogether.gov.sg. Safe Management Measures for Interaction with Service Users SSAs and community groups should plan the modality of essential aid distribution to strictly comply with the advisory to ensure the health and safety of your staff, volunteers and beneficiaries. Designated collection points should be set up in the vicinity with the necessary precautionary measures to ensure safe management, e.g. staggered collection times, safe distance of at least 1m between persons, wearing of masks, etc. Beneficiaries should collect their essential supplies and immediately return home. Buffet set-ups are strictly prohibited and beneficiaries must not congregate to consume their meals. For meals/essential food supplies to frail seniors and those who are home bound, these should be delivered to them as far as possible and left at the door to avoid physical interaction. If there is a need to check on them, maintain at least 1m safe distance. Carry out all activities in smaller groups of no more than 10 persons, e.g. by staggering the timing and implementing split teams.1 1 Should there be a need to conduct home visits, limit visits to not more than eight persons at any one from 28 Dec 2020. During the home /volunteers should don surgical mask and practise hand hygiene before/ after each home visit. During the home visit, residents and family members should also wear a mask as far as possible.",

          "context": "what you should know about the covid 19 vaccine\nSingapore received its first batch of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on 21 December. Following that, the recommendations of the Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination on its vaccination strategy for Singapore were accepted by the Government. Among its recommendations: The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine has been reviewed and endorsed for use in Singapore for individuals aged 16 and above. [Updated 3 Feb 2021] The Moderna COVID-19 vaccine has been authorised for use in Singapore. Details here. Vaccination will take place progressively, with priority given to: (i) Persons at high risk of being infected by COVID-19, including healthcare and frontline workers(ii) Persons most vulnerable to severe disease and complications if they fall ill with COVID-19. This includes the elderly and persons with medical comorbidities (those with 2 or more illnesses/diseases at the same time)Vaccinations for healthcare workers started on 30 Dec 2020, while vaccinations for the elderly (starting with those aged 70 and above) will begin from Feb 2021.\nComprehensive vaccination coverage will not only protect our population, but also those who cannot be vaccinated due to medical reasons. While vaccination is encouraged, it is voluntary. To help you make a more informed decision on whether you want to be vaccinated, here are some key questions, answered.A. Why is vaccination important?Vaccination is one of the key strategies to protect us and our loved ones against COVID-19, along with safe management measures, contact tracing and testing. The Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination proposed to vaccinate the population as widely as possible to not only reduce the number of people susceptible to the disease but also the chances of transmission. As more of us are vaccinated, the harder it will be for the virus to spread, and the safer we will all be as a society.A comprehensive vaccination coverage will then enable us to re-open further, allow more social activities to resume, and facilitate the recovery of our economy. However, until a significant proportion of the population is vaccinated, Singaporeans must continue to observe safe management measures.\nB. How do the COVID-19 vaccines work?Vaccines work with your body’s natural defenses to protect you from diseases. When you get a vaccine, your immune system is trained to recognise the virus and produces antibodies. These antibodies attack the viruses and stay in our bodies. Of the three vaccines that Singapore had signed Advance Purchase Agreements with – Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Sinovac – the first two are messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines, while the last uses an inactivated vaccine technology. mRNA vaccines contain material from the COVID-19 virus that gives our cells instructions on how to make a harmless protein that is unique to the virus. After our cells make copies of the protein, they destroy the genetic material from the vaccine. Our bodies then recognise that the protein should not be there and build antibodies to fight the virus. Inactivated vaccine technology uses weakened or inactive viral particles to stimulate our body to produce an immune response to the COVID-19 virus.Some vaccines require multiple doses, given weeks or months apart. This allows us to produce long-lived antibodies and develop memory cells – so that our bodies can rapidly fight the virus should we be exposed to it again.

Are COVID-19 vaccines safe, especially for the elderly and those who are vulnerable? The safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines for all Singaporeans is of utmost importance. Only vaccines that comply with the World Health Organisation’s guidelines and meet strict standards of safety, quality and efficacy will be used for our population. Multiple safety checks are in place before the vaccines are rolled-out in Singapore. For example, all vaccines to be deployed in Singapore must be authorised by the Health Sciences Authority. An expert panel, comprising 18 scientists and clinicians, was also formed to advise the Government on therapeutics and vaccines. In identifying suitable vaccines, the panel relies on data that comes from the different vaccine companies at their respective stages of clinical trials. Read more about the processes put in place here.D. How was the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine evaluated?In assessing the suitability of vaccine candidates, the Expert Committee took into consideration vaccine safety and efficacy, vaccine tolerability, as well as data adequacy of clinical trials.The Health Sciences Authority authorised the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, based on the following assessment: It has a high vaccine efficacy of 95% in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 disease in vaccinated persons aged 16 years and older. Its safety profile is consistent with other established and registered vaccines. No significant safety concerns have been detected. Common side effects were expected as part of the body’s natural response to a vaccination, such as injection site pain, fever, fatigue and headache. The benefits outweigh the known risks. But continued monitoring for longer-term efficacy of the vaccine, as well as monitoring for rare and serious adverse events will be needed. Until more information is available, pregnant women and those under 16 years old should not receive the vaccine. It is also not recommended at this stage for immunocompromised individuals.E. Are there side-effects?Some people may experience side-effects such as fever, redness and swelling at the injection site. These are common side-effects and expected as part of the body’s natural response towards build immunity against COVID-19. Hear what Prof Benjamin Seet has to say about the thorough review process for safety and tolerability.\nF. Who should take the vaccine?COVID-19 vaccination may be voluntary, but the Government strongly encourages all who are medically eligible to be vaccinated when it is offered to you. When more of us are vaccinated, the harder it will be for the virus to spread, and the safer we will be as a society. Priority will be given to those at greater risk of infection, such as healthcare and COVID-19 frontline workers, as well as vulnerable groups, including seniors. Pregnant women, people with compromised immune systems and those under 16 years old should not receive the vaccine yet, until more data is available.\nG. How much does it cost to be vaccinated? All Singaporeans and long-term residents in Singapore will be able to be vaccinated for free. Migrant workers will also be offered the vaccine, with more details to be announced.",

          "context": "additional measures introduced with dorscon orange\nAs Singapore is now seeing a few local cases without any links to previous cases or travel history to China, the Government has stepped up risk assessment from DORSCON Yellow to DORSCON Orange.The Government is prepared for a scenario involving community spread. Existing measures will be strengthened, and additional measures implemented, to minimise the risk of further community transmission and reduce the risk of imported cases.What is DORSCON Orange?DORSCON, or the ‘Disease Outbreak Response System Condition’, is a colour-coded framework that shows the current disease situation.Under DORSCON Orange, the virus is severe and spreads easily from person to person, However, there is no widespread transmission in Singapore and the virus is being contained.What are the additional measures to be introduced?Under DORSCON Orange, additional precautionary measures will be introduced to minimise the risk of further transmission of the virus, and raise the protection of vulnerable groups.Cancel or defer large-scale events, or put in place necessary precautions if proceedingEvent organisers are advised to cancel or defer non-essential large-scale events.For those who choose to continue, necessary precautions should be put in place. Organisers should carry out temperature screening, look out for individuals exhibiting respiratory symptoms such as cough and runny nose, and deny unwell individuals entry to the event.Organisers should remind participants who have recently travelled to mainland China not to attend events. Unwell individuals, those on a Leave of Absence, or those with recent travel history to mainland China should not attend events.If practical, travel declaration should be required from participants, and a registration list of participants should be maintained.Organisers should alsoensure event venues are well-ventilated, and commonly used areas are cleaned more frequently. There should also be adequate facilities for hand-washing.Daily health checks at workplaces, and enhanced business continuity capability plansAll employers should ensure employees take their temperatures at least twice daily, and check that they do not have respiratory symptoms, such as cough or runny nose. Unwell employees, or those with a fever, should leave the office immediately to see a doctor. To prepare for widespread community transmission, all workplaces should step up business continuity plans, which can include allowing employees to telecommute or dividing the workforce into segregated teams. Vulnerable groupsAdditional measures will be implemented to raise the protection of vulnerable groups: Healthcare institutions: the Ministry of Health (MOH) will be implementing temperature screening and closer controls of entry points into hospitals. Patients with pneumonia will be cared separately from other patients to reduce risk of transmission, and MOH will work with healthcare institutions to enhance infection control. Schools: Schools will suspend inter-school and external activities till the end of the March school holidays. These include the national school games, learning journeys and camps. Schools will continue with earlier implemented measures, such as classroom-based assemblies, school-based co-curricular activities in smaller groups and staggered recesses. Pre-schools and social/eldercare services: Restrictions on visitors to pre-school, social and eldercare premises will be imposed.What existing measures are in place? There are existing defensive measures in place to reduce the risk of imported cases and community transmission, as well as manage clusters of limited human-to-human transmission in Singapore. These include border controls to reduce the risk of imported cases, active case finding for similar cases, enhanced personal hygiene and environment cleaning, as well as heightened measures for vulnerable groups.

          "context": "experts explain covid 19 and safe management measures\nCurious how a swab test feels like, or wondered why we should still keep our social circles small even though safe distancing is not required on public transport?While some safe management measures may seem curious when compared to others, rest assured there is always a good reason behind each one.Hear the explanations straight from our three experts: Dr Janil Puthucheary, Senior Minister of State, Ministry of Communications and Information & Ministry of Health; Dr Koh Poh Koon, Senior Minister of State, Ministry of Health; and Assoc Prof Vernon Lee, Director (Communicable Diseases) at the Ministry of Health.\n1.Is the swab test painful and must I pay for it?Dr Koh: If you're having symptoms like the flu and your doctor recommends you go for a swab test, you can have it done for free, at the Public Health Preparedness Clinics (PHPCs), the regional screening centres, and all government polyclinics.It's a simple swab test through the nose and takes less than 10 seconds - I've done it twice in the last two weeks. The swabs are actually much thinner than a cotton bud that you normally use and only goes in slightly more than where your fingers normally can reach. The only discomfort you feel would be the urge to sneeze. But before you can even sneeze, the test is done. So, do not be afraid to go for the swab test if your doctor recommends it.2.Can I lower my mask when sipping my drink while walking?Dr Janil: Well, I don't know how you can drink with a mask still on - you have to lower it to drink. But of course, put it back on again when you're done. More importantly, if it’s bubble tea, ask for less sugar, please.\n3.Why should my colleagues and I stagger our lunch times when we share the same office space?Prof Vernon: There's a big difference between spending time in the office and going for lunch. In the office, most of the time, our masks are on and we are able to maintain good physical distance.Now, when we are dining with our colleagues, our masks are off most of the time. We are in much closer physical proximity, and we also tend to talk quite loudly in a social environment. So, it is very important then that we limit the number of colleagues that we go out for lunch with.It is also important for us to stagger our meal times, so that we can avoid overcrowding in our lunch venues.4.Are young children considered as pax when dining out?Prof Vernon: This is not quite like going to attractions, where young children can get in for free. Unfortunately with COVID-19, babies and young children are also susceptible to infection. That means that every individual must be counted towards the total number of people in a certain venue.\n5.Why must we wear our masks when dining out with our family?Prof Vernon: So, can you imagine if you're drinking a cup of coffee, and someone walks past you and coughs or sneezes at you without a mask on, that would be extremely gross.Therefore, if you're not eating or drinking, please put on a mask to protect yourself and to also protect others.6.Why are only small groups allowed in makan places?Dr Koh: The virus spreads most effectively when the three V's coincide. What are they? Vocalisation - which is about talking, singing without your mask on, and spreading aerosols and droplets into the air. Volume of interaction - when people come close together and spend a long time together talking to one another. Venue - the type of settings where people come together, places like restaurants, pubs, nightclubs, where people interact in close proximity.So, when the three V's come together - it is a super spreader event, and the virus can spread very effectively. That's why we recommend that in a restaurant setting, the group size should be kept small and you should sit further apart. You should put on your mask when you finish eating, so that you keep yourself and others safe.7.Why must I keep my social circle small, when I squeeze with many others on public transport?Prof Vernon: There are several differences between taking public transportation and interacting with our close family and friends in our social circle.In our social circles, as we eat and drink, there are many times when the masks are off, when we are talking loudly and have very close interactions. These provide the opportunity for respiratory droplets to transmit COVID-19 to one another. Public transportation, on the other hand, is quite different. Although sometimes you're not able to maintain safe distancing, wearing a mask and refraining from talking will prevent the explosion of respiratory droplets.Also, when you leave the MRT or bus, please sanitise your hands to keep your hands clean. If we do all this, we would actually reduce the risk of COVID-19 spread to a very low level.The other thing that we all must remember to do is to use our TraceTogether App, or to carry the Token. This helps us to contact trace any COVID-19 case that might occur.\n8.Can we stop wearing a mask if we practise social distancing?Prof Vernon: So, wearing a mask is actually one of the most important tools that prevent the spread of COVID-19.When we talk very loudly, or cough and sneeze, what happens is that respiratory droplets spread far and wide. The larger droplets may actually spread for about 0.4 metres before they drop to the ground, but very fine droplets might travel between one to two metres and linger around in the air for up to a minute. We put on a mask to prevent ourselves from getting infected by these droplets, and to prevent us from spreading disease to others.\n9.If walking is my exercise, can I not wear a mask?Dr Koh: The rule is that once we get out of the house, we should put on the mask. Treat it as part of your wardrobe, because it protects you and protects others as well. If you're walking very briskly, and you start to feel breathless, it is probably alright to take the mask off for a short period of time. Once you feel comfortable, you should put it back on, to maintain the protection.Some seniors find that it's quite difficult to do strenuous exercises, and sometimes when they go out for a stroll or walk, they tend to feel breathless. In that case, for their own safety, it's probably alright to let the mask off for a little while. But remember, the protection must be on at all times If you're not feeling breathless.\n11.Why must the SafeEntry and TraceTogether App/Token be used together?Dr Janil: Well, SafeEntry with the QR codes is about where we have been.TraceTogether is very different. It uses Bluetooth to check our proximity to other people. It's really about who we’re putting at risk when we’re sick. It's about protecting our loved ones. So, we need both to keep us all safe together.12.Why is the Stay-Home Notice duration different for some travellers?Dr Janil: There are three different ways in which we protect ourselves here in Singapore. For travellers from highest risk countries, they will be served a 14 day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) or quarantine because their risk is much higher than here in Singapore. For those from countries where things are improving, they serve a seven-day SHN, with COVID-19 swabs, of course. For other places, where their numbers are pretty much the same as ours, or even lower, the risk is low, about the same as going from Jurong to Punggol. So, we just ask them to do a COVID-19 swab test when they arrive in Singapore.This article is part of our #WhyAh series that explores the “Why’s” behind our COVID-19 safe management measures.",

          "context": "Additional measures for community activities in light of heightened alert to manage COVID transmission, and support for the sector\nThis document provides a summary of measures that will impact community activities under MCCY sectors during Phase Two (Heightened Alert) from 16 May through 13 June 2021.\n\n15 May 2021\nThe Multi-Ministry Task Force (MTF) have announced a further tightening of measures following the recent clusters of infections and an emerging pattern of local unlinked community cases. Effective from 16 May 2021 to 13 June 2021, this tightening will impact several sectors under the purview of MCCY, as well as groups and individuals working in these sectors. However, these tighter measures are necessary for Singapore to quickly contain the situation to prevent an escalation, and to protect the safety of our community. MCCY has put together support for these sectors to assist them to make the adjustments during this period.\n\nSummary of measures for MCCY sectors\nThe key measures that will impact MCCY sectors are as follows:\n\nLive Performances\nAll indoor and outdoor live performances should be deferred. Live performances which have been publicised before 5 May 2021 and which are scheduled to take place from 8 May through 13 Jun 2021 may only proceed with approval from MTI.\nFrom 16 May 2021, audiences will be capped at 100 persons with pre-event testing (PET), and up to 50 persons without PET. All performers must be properly masked at all times on stage. Singing or playing of instruments that require intentional expulsion of air (e.g. wind and brass instruments) will not be permitted at all times.\n\nDigital productions and associated rehearsals\nRecording of digital productions and their associated rehearsals are limited to 15 performers and crew on stage and backstage at any given time. This includes a maximum of 10 unmasked performers (of which no more than two persons can sing or play wind/brass instruments).\nArts and cultural organisations must notify NAC of their plans before proceeding with their digital productions and associated rehearsals.\n\nArts and culture classes, lectures, talks and workshops\nAll speakers, participants and instructors in arts and culture classes, lectures, talks and workshops must be properly masked at all times. Activities that cannot be conducted with masks on must be suspended. There are to be no classes in singing or wind and brass instruments, even if masked. Face shields are not permitted substitutes for proper masks.\n\nThe National Arts Council has released more details on the above: https://www.nac.gov.sg/whatwedo/support/sustaining-the-arts-during-covid-19/Safe-Management-Measures-for-the-Arts-and-Culture-Sector-.html\n\nMuseums\nArts and heritage venues such as museums can continue operations, but at a reduced capacity of 25%. Tours within museum premises may be conducted for a maximum group size of 20 persons (excluding guide), with maximum of two persons allowed in any one sub-group, with all other prevailing safe management measures in place such as social distancing.\n\nThe National Heritage Board has released more details on the above: https://www.nhb.gov.sg/what-we-do/our-work/sector-development/museum-roundtable/safe-management-measures-for-museum-stakeholders\n\nSporting activities\nCapacity limits for indoor and outdoor facilities have been amended to one person per 16sqm, or 50 persons, whichever is lower. This is to ensure there is even more space between people who are exercising, to minimise risk of transmission. \n\na) Indoor facilities\nIn line with the measure to cease all indoor “mask-off” activities, only non-strenuous activities can continue in all indoor sports venues, and participants must be masked at all times. Activities which will result in participants lowering their masks to catch a breath will not be permitted. As previously announced, no sharing of common equipment will be permitted indoors to reduce fomite transmission. \n\nb) Outdoor facilities and activities\nOutdoors, individuals engaging in strenuous exercises may do so in groups of up to two persons (including any instructor), keeping 2m distance between individuals. They can be unmasked when exerting but should put on their masks thereafter. \n\nc) Indoor and Outdoor large group classes\nIndoor and outdoor group classes are capped at 30 persons (including the instructor) or the venue capacity cap, whichever is lower. All individuals must remain masked at all times. All instructors and participants must be masked at all times.  Class participants must be in groups of no more than two, with 2m between individuals, and 3m between groups.\nOutdoor classes for strenuous activities which require participants to be unmasked, will be capped at two persons including the instructor.   \n\nSport Singapore (SportSG) has released more details on the above: https://go.gov.sg/furtherstrictersmm16mayto13june2021 \n\nCongregational and other worship services\nCongregational and other worship services will be limited to 100 persons with PET, or up to 50 persons at a time without PET. This is subject to safe management measures and the venue capacity limits of the premises. Religious workers support these services should be kept to a minimum.\nWorshippers can participate in worship services in groups of no more than two persons. Masks must be worn at all times by all persons including when speaking during congregational and other worship services. Face shields are not permitted substitutes for proper face masks.\nTo reduce the risk of transmission, singing and the playing of wind/brass instruments will not be allowed. There should also be no sharing of prayer or common items.   \n\nOther religious activities\nReligious Organisations (ROs) may continue to use places of worship to conduct religious rites, in groups of no more than two persons. All other religious activities (e.g. religious classes for adults and children) will be suspended.\n\nDigital productions and associated rehearsals\nRecording of digital productions at the place of worship are limited to 15 performers and crew on stage and backstage at any given time. This includes a maximum of 10 unmasked performers (of which no more than two persons can sing or play wind/brass instruments). ROs must notify MCCY of their plans before proceeding with their digital productions.\n\nWedding solemnisations and Funeral rites\nWedding solemnisations may continue, with up to 100 persons with PET, or up to 50 persons without PET, subject to venue capacity limits. The cap of 100 and 50 persons respectively, exclude the solemnizer and religious and supporting workers, whose numbers should be kept to a minimum.\nIn line with curbs on dine-in F&B establishments, wedding receptions will not be allowed.\nFunerals, wakes, burial/cremations, installation of niches and post-funeral rites at places of worship can involve not more than 20 attendees at any time, subject to venue capacity limits. Attendees should be organised in groups of no more than two persons. The cap of 20 excludes religious and supporting workers, whose numbers should be kept to a minimum. Attendees are to maintain safe distancing and be masked at all times to reduce the risk of transmission. \n\nMore details have been released separately: https://www.mccy.gov.sg/about-us/news-and-resources/press-statements/2021/may/phase-two-heightened-alert-religious-activities\n\nSupport for MCCY sectors\nMCCY and our agencies have been focused on providing support to groups, businesses, and individuals within our sectors to manage the disruptions resulting from COVID-19, and to help them emerge stronger. Both the Arts and Culture Resilience Package and the Sports Resilience Package have been dedicated to tide our sectors throughout the pandemic.\n\nArts & Culture\nThe Arts and Culture Resilience Package has been topped up over the past year to the current $75M. This funds operating grants, venue hire subsidies, assistance to SEPs and assistance to support the transformation of businesses.\nIn addition, MCCY will provide further support for arts and culture self-employed persons (SEPs) affected by the latest tightened measures. We will also subsidise the costs of PET for arts and culture companies presenting permitted live performances from 16 May – 13 June 2021. This will enable larger audiences to attend live performances in this period safely, cushioning the financial impact to arts companies caused by these tightened measures. NAC will release more information on how SEPs and groups presenting live performances can apply for the additional support.\n\nSports\nSportSG recently announced relief measures for businesses and SEPs affected by the measures announced on 8 May for the period up to 30 May 2021. This includes project grants, operating grants, training assistance grants, and direct cash assistance. This will continue to be available, to help affected businesses defray the costs of overheads. We will extend the support to cover the heightened alert period up to 13 June 2021.\nSportSG is looking into the provision of more outdoor spaces within its ActiveSG facilities for coaches and instructors to conduct their classes. The mechanism to apply for these spaces will be announced to the community when ready.\nDetails will be communicated by the respective agencies when ready.\n\nKeeping our community safe\nIt is critical that our people, businesses, and government work together to bring down the number of COVID-19 cases, to keep our community safe. MCCY understands that the tightened measures are disruptive to our sectors and have developed support packages to help our stakeholders make the necessary adjustments. MCCY very much appreciates our religious organisations, as well as our arts, culture, and sports businesses and communities for rallying together to implement the safe management measures. Together, we will emerge safe, and stronger.\nIssued by:\nMinistry of Culture, Community and Youth",

          "context": "Advisory to dormitory operators - Additional measures in line with Phase 2 (Heightened Alert)\nIssued on 17 May 2021\n\nAdditional Measures in line with Phase 2 (Heightened Alert)\n\nTo better protect our migrant workers (MWs) living in dormitories from being exposed to COVID-19 in the community, the Ministry of Manpower will implement additional measures for them from 17 May 2021. These measures are in response to the community measures introduced on 14 May for Phase 2 (Heightened Alert). It is important that dormitory operators continue to ensure good Safe Living Measures (SLM) are practised in the dormitories.\n\nSuspension of Safe Rest Day Visits to Recreation Centres\nVisits to the Recreation Centres for Safe Rest Days will be suspended temporarily until further notice. We are currently exploring arrangements to allow visits to Recreation Centres in a safe and controlled manner during this Phase of heightened alert and will update in due course. This measure is to mitigate the risk of them being exposed to possible infection and subsequently infecting others in their dormitories. MWs will still be allowed to carry out essential errands, including reporting sick if they are unwell. MWs who are found to have acted irresponsibly may face further actions such as having their work passes revoked.\n\nUse of Communal Dormitory Facilities\nIn line with the national measures during this period, all the gyms, beer gardens and communal dining facilities within the dormitories will need to be closed, and canteens can only offer takeaway services (i.e. no dining in). MOM will step up enforcement on the compliance to Safe Management Measures during this period.\nEnsure that all activities within your dormitories are to be capped at the permissible group size of up to two persons. You should remind your residents to continue to adhere to the appropriate Safe Management Measures within your dormitories.\n\nNo Change to Work, RRT and Vaccination Appointments\nThere will be no changes to the work arrangements for your residents. They will be able to continue to go to work if they have a green AccessCode. Employers have been reminded to continue to arrange dedicated transport arrangements for your residents, at staggered pick-up and drop-off timings to and from the worksites.\nYour residents will also be allowed to leave their dormitories to attend their Rostered Routine Testing (RRT) and vaccination appointments. Dormitory operators are required to ensure that your residents adhere to their assigned groupings, to restrict intermixing.\n\nResponsibilities as dormitory operators\nEnsure that Safe Living Measures are enforced and adhered to, including, but not limited to the following measures:\nGood layer segregation with residential floors or layers, to restrict intermixing.\nConsistent cleaning and disinfection of high-touch surfaces and communal areas.\nStaggered pick-up and drop off timings, especially during peak hours.\nRemind your residents not to go to work if they feel unwell and seek medical care. Inform your residents to comply with the Infection Prevention Control (IPC) Measures, including:\nDos\tDon’ts\nWear a mask correctly, covering nose and mouth at all times.\nMaintain good personal hygiene, including washing their hands with soap and water frequently.\nUse hand sanitizers after coming into contact with high touch areas, such as ATMs.\nMaintain 1 metre safe distance.\nSeek medical help if they are feeling unwell, via telemedicine on FWMOMCareApp. Inform the dormitory operator or employer to provide a dedicated transport to the regional medical centre. For emergencies, call 995.\nDo not intermix with other MWs working in different zones at your worksite or residing in other floors or layers in the dormitories.\nDo not go to work when unwell.\nEmployers are responsible for the upkeep and maintenance of your residents’ well-being. You should continue to work with employers and make the necessary arrangements to ensure that your residents are given proper food during this period. Dorms with mini-mart operations should prepare to support MWs by ensuring sufficient stock of daily essentials during this period. Mini-marts should not take advantage and increase prices.\nIf your residents need access to physical remittance services, inform the Forward Assurance and Support Team (FAST) so that they can assess how best to facilitate this for your residents.\nAs this may be a difficult period for your residents, we encourage that you continue to engage your residents to provide them with emotional and mental support. You may refer to Annex A for more information on the support you can provide to your residents. If you find your resident(s) in emotional distress, please encourage them to call these helplines for help:\nMigrant Workers’ Centre: 6536 2692 (24/7)\nHealthServe:  3157 4460 (Call-back service)\nHear4U Whatsapp: 6978 2722 (Tamil) | 6978 2723 (Bengali) | 6978 2724 (Mandarin) | 6978 2725 (English)\nDuring this period, we will also be disseminating care packs, including masks and hand sanitisers to the MWs. For the dorm operators at FEDA dorms, it will be delivered to you from 19 May 2021 onwards. As for the dorm operators at non FEDA dorms, we will inform you the collection details once the care packs are ready for dissemination.\nFor further queries, please contact us at www.mom.gov.sg/efeedback.\nThank you for supporting us in our fight against COVID-19.",

          "context": "Phase Two (Heightened Alert) - Tighter measures for religious activities\nThis document provides the conditions under which religious organisations (ROs) are permitted to carry out activities in places of worship during Phase Two (Heightened Alert) from 16 May through 13 June 2021.\n\n15 May 2021\nOn 14 May 2021, the Multi-Ministry Taskforce announced tighter measures to be put in place from 16 May through 13 June 2021 to mitigate the risk of further community spread of COVID-19. This document provides the conditions under which religious organisations (ROs) are permitted to carry out activities in places of worship during this period of Phase Two (Heightened Alert).\n\nPhase Two (Heightened Alert)\nUnder Phase Three (Heightened Alert) that began on 8 May 2021, enhanced precautionary measures were imposed on religious activities, namely a decrease in capacity for congregational and other worship services from 250 persons to 100 persons, without pre-event testing (PET), and no congregational singing.\nUnder Phase Two (Heightened Alert), from 16 May through 13 June 2021, tighter measures will apply to religious activities. To reduce risks of community transmission, indoor “mask-off” activities will cease during this period. We will also further reduce the current permissible group size from up to 5 persons, to up to 2 persons. The new measures are as follows:\n\na. Congregational and other worship services will be limited to 100 persons (decrease from 250 persons today)\n\ni. Up to 50 persons without PET; \nii. Up to 100 persons with PET for all attendees;\n\nb. No singing and playing of wind/brass instruments for live performance elements;\n\nc. Suspension of all other non-congregational religious activities, except for religious rites; and \n\nd. Reduced capacity for marriage solemnizations as well as wakes, funerals and post-funeral rites.\n  \nAnnex A summarises the key changes for ROs going from Phase Three (Heightened Alert) to Phase Two (Heightened Alert).\n\nWorship Services\nFrom 16 May 2021, ROs may conduct congregational and other worship services at places of worship, with up to 50 persons at a time without PET, subject to safe management measures and the safe capacity of the premises. Religious and supporting workers should be kept to a minimum.\nWorshippers can participate in worship services in groups of no more than 2 persons (decrease from 5 persons today), in line with prevailing national requirements.\nROs can conduct congregational and other worship services, for more than 50 persons and up to 100 persons at a time, only if there is PET for all worshippers1 as follows: \n\na. ROs must ensure that all worshippers [except where paragraph (b) below applies] obtain a negative COVID-19 test result before they may be admitted into the venue where the service is being held.2\n\ni. The test must be an MOH-approved COVID-19 test (either an Antigen Rapid Test (ART) or Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test) administered by an approved test provider.3\n\nii. The test results are only valid for 24 hours from the time an individual registers at the testing premises to take the test. The RO must ensure that the result of the test is valid until the end of the worshipper’s participation in the worship service.\n\niii. The worshipper must be able to produce proof of the test result, which are either (i) Check-in Successful banner (displayed on the SafeEntry (Business) application upon scanning with TraceTogether App/Token), (ii) COVID-19 Test Result Notice (ART), (iii) COVID-19 Test Result Notice (PCR), or (iv) Patient Risk Profile Portal (PRPP) ART Result Slip.\n\nb. The requirements for PET in paragraph 6(a) above do not apply to worshippers who have been vaccinated4 or produce an exemption notice5. Before being admitted into the venue where the service is being held, the worshipper must produce valid documentation of either their vaccination or exemption notice which must remain valid until the end of the worshipper’s participation in the service.\n\nc. Where PET is required for a service, ROs must prominently display signs at each point of entry and exit (including emergency exit) to the venue where the service is being held, to indicate:\n\ni. The space is a restricted place6, and the duration for which it will be a restricted place (i.e. the duration of the service). ROs must clearly mark the boundaries of the restricted place (e.g. though fencing, rope, signs, walls, partition, screen).\n\nii. That entry and remaining within the restricted place is allowed only to individuals with a cleared status (i.e. have a valid negative COVID-19 test result notice, valid documentation of vaccination or exemption notice).\n\nd. ROs are to highlight to worshippers attending services for more than 50 persons and up to 100 persons that they will be denied entry into the venue where the service is being held if they do not produce the relevant negative COVID-19 test result notice, vaccination notice, or exemption notice, with the necessary validity period.\nFor congregational and other worship services exceeding 50 persons and up to 100 persons with PET, worshippers have to be segregated into zones holding no more than 50 persons each. \n\na. As there should be no mingling of individuals across zones, each zone must be completely separated from another by either a physical solid partition (at least 1.8m high if not floor-to-ceiling, from wall-to-wall); or at least 3m physical spacing demarcated by continuous physical barriers (e.g. rope barrier).\n\nb. There must either be a separate ingress/egress for each zone or staggered entrance/exit timings so that worshippers from different zones do not mix with one another during entry/exit.\n\nc. ROs must also take reasonable steps to ensure that worshippers do not cross the physical barrier (where applicable) or enter another zone that they are not assigned to.\nROs should continue to observe the following safe management measures for worship services (including services conducted with PET):\n\na. Keep worship services to as short a duration as possible. There must be no reception or mingling between worshippers, before, during or after each worship service.  \n\nb. All persons present (except children below 6 years of age) must wear a face mask at all times.7 Face shields are not permitted as substitutes for face masks. Young children are still strongly encouraged to use a mask, especially when they are in a group setting (e.g. attending worship service).  \n\nc. Live performance elements are permitted during the worship service at places of worship, with the following safe management measures (see Annex B for details). \n\ni. A maximum of 30 persons are allowed to be involved in/support the conduct of the worship service. This includes persons on-stage, backstage or off-stage. \n\nii. Unmasking will not be permitted. To ensure the safety of worshippers, singing or playing of wind/brass instruments will also not be permitted. \n\niii. Singing (with or without the mask on) is not allowed. \n\niv. Masks must be worn when speaking during congregational and other worship services. A face shield is not a permitted substitute for a proper mask. \n\nv. There must be at least a 3-metre setback between persons involved in the conduct of live performance elements and worshippers.\n\nvi. Minimise the duration of live performance elements for congregational and other worship services. \n\nd. There should be no sharing of prayer and other common items (e.g. holy books, passing of offertory baskets, prayer mats) as this increases the risk of COVID-19 transmission. Worshippers are to bring along their personal prayer items instead, where required. \n\ne. Places of worship with reduced air circulation (e.g. enclosed prayer spaces, air-conditioned worship hall) should, where possible, open doors and windows to naturally ventilate the space after each use.\n\nMarriage Solemnizations\nFrom 16 May 2021, ROs may continue to use places of worship to conduct marriage solemnizations where: \n\na. Solemnizations involving up to 50 attendees: PET will not be required.\n\nb. Solemnizations involving between 51 - 100 attendees: PET will be required for all attendees.8\n\nc. These activities are subject to safe management measures and the safe capacity of the premises, and exclude the solemnizer and religious and supporting workers, whose numbers should be kept to a minimum.   \n\nd. If the total number of attendees is more than 50 (including the wedding couple), they must still be segregated into zones of up to 50 persons each (see paragraph 7 for zoning requirements). An individual attending the solemnization must remain within his or her respective assigned zone and must not enter an unassigned zone. \n\ne. Attendees must maintain a 1-metre safe distance between groups except a core “wedding party”9, which is allowed to comprise up to 20 persons (including the couple and their two witnesses). There should be no intermingling or mixing between groups nor between the “wedding party” and these other groups. \n\nf. There must not be any reception with food and drinks, or wedding celebrations that are not essential religious rites.\n\ng. ROs must also comply with prevailing safe management measures stipulated on the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI)’s website10. \nAlthough solemnizations at places of worship11 may continue to involve live instrumental music (non-wind/brass) with the necessary safe management measures in place (see Annex C), we strongly encourage this to be suspended or the duration be shortened during this period of heightened alert. Persons involved in/supporting the live instrumental music segment should be kept to the minimum. No other performances (e.g. singing, dance, variety act) are allowed.\nROs are strongly encouraged to continue offering video link solemnizations as an option for couples.\n\nFunerals\nFrom 16 May 2021, funerals, wakes, installation of niches and post-funeral rites12 at places of worship can involve not more than 20 attendees (decrease from 30 today) at any one time, including the day of burial/cremation, and in groups of no more than 2 persons (excluding religious and supporting workers, whose numbers should be kept to a minimum), subject to safe management measures and the safe capacity of the premises. \n\na. There must not be any reception with food and drinks. \n\nb. ROs must also comply with prevailing safe management measures listed on MTI’s website13. \nFunerary-related activities at places of worship14 may continue to involve live instrumental music (non-wind/brass) with the necessary safe management measures in place (see Annex C). Persons involved in/supporting the live instrumental music segment should be kept to the minimum. No other performances (e.g. singing, dance, variety act) are allowed.\nVisits to columbaria at places of worship should be kept as short as possible, with no mingling between groups of no more than 2 persons (decrease from 5 persons today). \n\nOther Religious Activities\nFrom 16 May 2021, ROs may continue to use places of worship to conduct religious rites, in groups of no more than 2 persons (decrease from 5 persons today) and maintain safe distancing. Religious and supporting workers involved in the conduct of these rites should be kept to a minimum.\nAll other religious activities (e.g. religious classes for adults and children) will be suspended.\nGiven the current need to minimise the risk of COVID-19 transmission, ROs are strongly encouraged to conduct these activities via remote means or defer them until the COVID-19 situation improves.\n\nRecording and Broadcast of Religious Services and Prayers\nROs are encouraged to continue supporting the religious needs of their communities via remote means such as recording and broadcast of religious services and prayers. From 16 May 2021, ROs can have up to 15 persons on-location for these productions, of which up to 10 persons can be unmasked at any one time, with no more than 2 persons unmasked for singing and/or playing wind/brass instruments. Those singing and/or playing wind/brass instruments must maintain 2 metres between all other individuals. All other persons present must maintain a 1-metre separation. The time spent on-location for this activity should be kept as short as possible. The production team must also put in place safe management measures, including no-cross deployment between locations, and thorough cleaning of technical equipment. There shall be no audience.\nROs who wish to use their premises for digital recording or broadcast are required to notify through the CPRO website of (i) the planned dates of the digital productions; (ii) venue; and (iii) confirmation of adherence to the performers and crew limits, before conducting the digital productions.\n\nSafe capacity in the place of worship\nAll the permitted religious activities in paragraphs 9 to 19 (i.e. excluding congregational and other worship services) can continue to take place concurrently, subject to safe management measures, and stipulated capacity limits for these activities – and only if these activities can be conducted safely at separate locations within the place of worship, with no interaction between worshippers while entering, exiting or while in the premises.\nROs are strongly encouraged to support the religious needs of their communities through remote means, as far as possible, in line with national guidelines to reduce social interactions, and thus minimise risk of COVID-19 transmission.\n\na. ROs should consider reducing other concurrent activities when congregational and other worship services are ongoing, so that there is a smaller total number of people on the premises at any one time, which will help to minimise the risk of large clusters from forming.\n\nDeployment of manpower\nROs should primarily engage their religious workers and staff to support the permitted religious activities but can deploy volunteers to support if necessary. The number of personnel involved in conducting each permitted activity should be kept to a minimum.\nFrom 16 May 2021, telecommuting will be the default for workplaces, so as to minimise the number of on-site religious workers and staff. The religious workers and administrative staff should comply with prevailing workplace safe management measures stipulated by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM).15 Restrictions against cross-deployment16 across worksites remain in place. \n\nTraceTogether and SafeEntry\nTraceTogether-only SafeEntry, where the TraceTogether App or Token is required for SafeEntry check-ins, will be required at all venues that are required to implement SafeEntry from 17 May 202117. ROs must make the necessary preparations to accept check-ins by the TraceTogether App or Token. ROs can refer to www.safeentry.gov.sg for FAQs, or more information on how to set up TraceTogether-only SafeEntry for their premises.\nSafeEntry Gateway (SEGW) will be progressively introduced as an additional mode of SafeEntry check-in to provide quicker and more seamless check-in using the TraceTogether App or Token. Existing modes of SafeEntry check-in will remain in place. Since 19 Apr 2021, ROs conducting congregational and other worship services for more than 100 persons have been required to deploy the SafeEntry Gateway at their main entrances as an additional check-in mode. ROs conducting congregational and other worship services for 100 persons or less will also be required to deploy the SEGW at their main entrances by 15 June 2021. ROs may deploy either the physical SEGW Box or use the SEGW function found in the latest version of the SafeEntry (Business) App based on their needs. [Refer to https://go.gov.sg/gateway-overview for more information.]. \n\nMandatory submission of Safe Management Plans\nROs must acknowledge through the CPRO website the new conditions for religious activities imposed from 16 May through 13 June 2021 before commencing the activities. ROs that have not submitted their Safe Management Plans (SMPs) previously for Phase 3 will need to submit their plans, at least 2 days before commencing any activities outlined above. The detailed requirements and format for submitting these SMPs can be found at www.cpro.gov.sg.\nMCCY reserves the right to suspend a RO’s activities if there are gaps in the SMP submitted and until the necessary rectifications are made. ROs are responsible for the implementation of safe management measures and action could be taken for lapses and breaches. Should there be any confirmed COVID-19 cases linked to a RO’s premises or place of worship, the premises may be closed for a period of time as determined by the authorities.\n\nWorking together to make Singapore COVID-safe\nThe tightening of measures for religious activities reflect the seriousness of the current COVID-19 situation. We will have to remain vigilant and regularly refine our safe management measures in order to minimise the risk of COVID-19 transmission. MCCY will continue to work with our ROs to ensure a COVID-19 safe environment for religious activities.\nIssued by:\nMinistry of Culture, Community and Youth",

Previously, up to 50% of employees28 who are able to work from home could be at the workplace at any time. Now, employers must ensure that all employees who are able to work from home do so. Social gatherings at the workplace are disallowed. These measures help lower transmission risks by reducing the levels of interaction at common spaces at or near the workplace, and in public places, including public transport.\n\nIssued on 9 May 2020\nUpdated as of 14 May 2021\n\nThe tripartite partners (MOM, SNEF, and NTUC) have updated the workplace safe management measures to allow greater flexibility for businesses, while mitigating the risk of widespread COVID-19 transmission. Effective implementation of these measures will help to avoid having to impose tighter measures.\nThese requirements are meant for general workplace settings. Specific workplaces like construction worksites and shipyards may have to fulfil additional requirements and should refer to sector-specific requirements1.\nAgencies including MOM, Building and Construction Authority (BCA) and Enterprise Singapore (ESG) will continue to enforce safe management measures and take action against errant employers. This may include issuing stop-work orders and financial penalties.\n\nSafe Management Measures\nTo ensure COVID-safe workplaces, employers should take care of:\nYour workers;\nYour workplaces; and\nThose who may become unwell at your workplaces.\n\nA. Take care of your workers\nProvide employees options to work from home.\nFrom 16 May 2021 to 13 June 2021, employers must exercise heightened vigilance at the workplace.\nEmployers must ensure that all employees who are able to work from home do so.\nEmployers are encouraged to support as many employees in working from home as possible. This will help to limit the number of employees exposed at the workplace at any point in time, and reduce crowding in common areas, e.g. pantries, toilets, lifts. Having more employees work from home will also help sustain business operations should a case emerge at the workplace.\nWork-from-home measures should enable employees to maintain work-life harmony while continuing to meet business needs. The Tripartite Advisory on mental well-being at workplaces sets out practical guidance on measures that employers can adopt to support their employees’ mental well-being under a variety of work arrangements.\nFor employees who are still unable to work from home, employers should review work processes, provide the necessary IT equipment to employees and adopt solutions that enable remote working and online collaboration. Employers are encouraged to leverage technology2 to ensure business continuity and safe management.\nCompanies should continue to conduct virtual meetings as far as possible.\nCompanies should pay special attention to vulnerable employees3 (e.g. persons who are aged 60 and above, and patients who are immunocompromised4 or have concurrent medical conditions). Employers are encouraged to enable these employees to work-from-home, allow them to travel to/from work at off-peak timings, temporarily redeploy them to another role within the company, or take other appropriate measures to reduce their exposure to infection risk.\nFor employees at the workplace, employers must ensure the following precautions are in place:\nStagger start times and allow flexible workplace hours5: This will spread out staff across time and place, and reduces possible congregation of employees at common spaces at or near the workplace, such as entrances, exits, lobbies, canteens, pantries. It also reduces congestion of people in public places, including public transport.\nEmployers are encouraged to stagger the start times for all employees such that at least half of all employees arrive at the workplace at or after 10am, as far as possible. If physical meetings are needed, they can be scheduled after 10 am. These measures would enable more employees to avoid peak-hour travel, especially if employees require the use of public transport. Timings of lunch and other breaks should also be staggered accordingly.\nIf it is not feasible to implement staggered start times, flexible workplace hours, and staggered break hours due to operational reasons (e.g. manufacturing production line activities), employers must implement other systemic arrangements to reduce congregation of employees at common spaces6.\nNo cross-deployment across worksites7: No employee should work at more than one worksite. If cross-deployment cannot be avoided (e.g. due to the nature of the job), additional safeguards must be taken to minimise the risk of cross infection8.\nEmployers should avoid organising work-related events unless critical (e.g. training session): All work-related events9 that proceed must adhere to prevailing workplace Safe Management Measures and are subjected to the following requirements10:\nThe number of persons per event must be capped at 50 persons to limit the risk of exposure to infection.\nAttendees must maintain at least 1 metre safe distancing between individual attendees, as per the requirement at the workplace.\nFood and drinks are not allowed at work-related events.\nWork-related events at third-party venues11 will also be subject to any additional premise owners’ safe management policies.\nSocial gatherings at the workplace are disallowed: Employees should have their meal breaks at the workplace individually.\nWear masks at the workplace: Employers must ensure that all onsite personnel, including employees, visitors, suppliers and contractors, wear a mask and other necessary personal protective equipment13 at all times at the workplace, except during activities that require masks to be removed14. Masks will have to be worn immediately after the activity is completed.\nEmployers should ensure that they have sufficient masks for all employees, including any need to replace masks more frequently due to workplace conditions15.\nWhere possible, employers should consider improving the working environment for employees to enable them to sustain wearing the masks.\nObserve good personal hygiene: Employers should encourage their employees to observe good personal hygiene, e.g. wash their hands regularly and refrain from touching their face.\n\nB. Take care of the workplace\nControl access at the workplace to only essential employees and authorised visitors. Employers must use the SafeEntry visitor management system to record the entry of all personnel (including employees and visitors) entering the workplace16. All employees and visitors should check-in and check-out of workplaces using SafeEntry (with their TraceTogether app or token) to help MOH in establishing potential transmission chains.\nPersonnel who are unwell (including having a fever upon temperature screening) must be refused entry to the workplace.\nVisitors who are unwell should be asked to reschedule their appointments to another day when they are well, or be served via alternate means.17\nEmployers must ensure that employees and visitors must declare via SafeEntry or other means18 (e.g. electronic or hard copy records), before being allowed to enter premises, that they:\nAre currently not under a Quarantine Order, Stay-Home Notice;\nHave not had close contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case in the past 14 days19; and\nDo not have any fever or flu-like symptoms.\nAdhere to travel advisories: Employers should ensure that their employees adhere to MOH’s prevailing travel advisory.\nWhere physical interaction cannot be avoided, precautions should be taken to ensure clear physical spacing of at least 1 metre through physical means20 and demarcation of safe physical distances (at least 1m apart) using visual indicators, where possible, in the following situations21:\nBetween all persons at meeting rooms, work areas, and workstations; and\nAt all times during work-related events held at the workplace.\nEmployers who are service buyers should also require their suppliers / contractors to implement similar safe distancing measures, so that operations and business interactions with these suppliers / contractors are kept safe. Where physical interactions are still necessary, e.g. delivery of goods, employers must adopt precautionary measures such as scheduling delivery times by different suppliers in a staggered manner. The durations of such transactions should be kept as short as possible.\nMinimise need for physical touchpoints: Employers should reduce the occurrences of, or need for common physical touchpoints in the workplace where possible (e.g. by deploying contactless access controls). Where physical contact is needed, additional safeguards must be taken to minimise the risk of cross infection (e.g. frequent disinfection of touchpoints).\nStep up cleaning of workplace premises through the following:\nEmployers must ensure regular cleaning of common spaces, particularly areas with high human contact22. Where physical meetings are held or meals are taken at common spaces such as pantries or canteens, employers must clean and disinfect tables between each meeting or seating.\nEmployers must ensure that machinery and equipment shared between different employees across different shifts or alternate teams are cleaned and disinfected before changing hands. The sanitation and hygiene advisories23 disseminated by the National Environmental Agency (NEA) must be adhered to.\nProvide cleaning and disinfecting agents at the following areas:\nCleaning agents (e.g. liquid soap, toilet paper) must be available at all toilets and hand-wash stations.\nDisinfecting agents (e.g. hand sanitisers) must be installed at all human traffic stoppage points within the workplace, such as entrances, reception areas, security booths and lift lobbies.\nDisinfecting agents (e.g. disinfectant sprays, paper towels and wipes) must be provided at meeting rooms and other common spaces such as pantries or canteens.\nC. Take care of workers who become unwell at the workplace\nEnsure regular checks for temperature and respiratory symptoms24 for all onsite employees and visitors, twice daily or where relevant. Employers must be able to demonstrate that these checks are in place during inspections.\nRecord proximity data on phones: To help MOH to more quickly identify potential close contacts of COVID-19 patients and reduce disease transmission, employers should encourage all employees to download and activate the TraceTogether app25.\nActively monitor unwell employees and guard against incipient outbreaks:\nEmployees at the workplace who have visited a clinic must submit to their employers records of their MCs and diagnoses provided (only for COVID-19-related symptoms, including acute respiratory infections), and if they were tested for COVID-19 and the results of their tests.\nEmployers must take preventive action to guard against incipient outbreaks at the workplace, such as advising employees who are unwell to stay home and consult a doctor rather than going to the workplace, requiring these employees on MCs to closely monitor their health before returning to the workplace and requiring these employees’ close contacts at the workplace to monitor their health more regularly.\nWhere possible, employers should ensure that each employee visits only one clinic for check-ups if unwell. Otherwise, employees should inform the clinic of all recent doctor visits over past 14 days for any symptoms that may be related to COVID-1926.\nManage unwell cases: An evacuation plan must be prepared for unwell or suspected cases, as well as for other onsite personnel.\nAny employee who is feeling unwell or showing symptoms of illness should report to his employer, leave the workplace and consult a doctor immediately, even if symptoms may appear mild. Employers must track and record these cases as part of Safe Management Measures.\nFor incapacitated or unconscious individuals, employers must clear the area of other personnel and administer aid immediately. Employers should call 995 for an emergency ambulance to ferry them to the nearest hospital.\nManage confirmed cases: A follow-up plan must be put in place in the event of a confirmed case. Upon being notified of a confirmed case, employers must adopt the following precautionary measures:\nImmediately vacate and cordon-off the immediate section of the workplace premises where the confirmed case worked. There is no need to vacate the building or the whole floor if there had been no sustained and close contact with the confirmed case; and\nCarry out a thorough cleaning and disinfecting all relevant on-site areas and assets that were exposed to confirmed cases, in accordance to NEA guidelines.\nFor worksites with confirmed cases, businesses could be suspended if there are public health grounds.\n\nD. Implement a system of Safe Management Measures\nEmployers must establish a system to implement the above Safe Management Measures to provide a safe working environment and minimise risks of COVID-19 outbreaks. These measures must be implemented in a sustainable manner for as long as necessary.\nImplement a detailed monitoring plan to ensure compliance with Safe Management Measures and timely resolution of outstanding issues27.\nAppoint Safe Management Officer(s) (“SMO”) to assist in the implementation, coordination and monitoring of the system of Safe Management Measures at the workplace. For unionised companies, union leaders or WSH officers could be appointed as SMOs. Employers must provide appointed SMOs with adequate instruction, information and supervision as is necessary for them to fulfil their required duties. SMOs are strongly encouraged to receive training. The duties of the Officer(s) include:\nTo coordinate implementation of Safe Management Measures, including identifying relevant risks, recommending and assisting in implementing measures to mitigate the risks, and communicating the measures to all personnel working in the workplace;\nTo conduct inspections and checks, to ensure compliance at all times. Any non-compliance found during the inspections should be reported and documented;\nTo remedy non-compliance found during the inspections and checks through immediate action; and\nTo keep records of inspections, checks and correction actions, to be made available upon request by a Government Inspector.\nEmployers must ensure that the measures above are in place, communicated and explained to employees prior to resuming work onsite (refer to Annex B for a checklist of Safe Management Measures that should be in place for resumption of business activities). Signs should also be put up to remind employees and visitors to observe all measures in place. Unionised companies should engage their unions on such arrangements.\nEmployees should also do their part in adhering to the measures to create a safe working environment. Those who wish to report breaches or poor practices can do so via SnapSAFE, an app that allows the reporting of workplace safety and health issues to MOM.\nYou may refer to the frequently asked questions on Safe Management Measures at the workplace after Circuit Breaker period.

Such companies will be required to demonstrate that cross-deployment or interaction between employees is critical for business operations, when requested by MOM or their sector agencies.\nE.g. systems are in place to ensure no direct contact between the cross-deployed personnel.\nI.e. events not organised primarily for social interaction. Work-related events that are allowed to proceed are those which primarily involve employees or stakeholders, such as conferences / seminars, corporate retreats, staff training sessions, Annual General Meetings and Extraordinary General Meetings.\nThis is separate and distinct from MICE events approved by the Singapore Tourism Board (STB).\nWork-related events are allowed to resume at third-party venues, but are subject to any additional premise owners’ safe management policies.\n<nil>\nMasks for general office workplaces; for other workplace settings, please refer to sector-specific guidelines.\nThe requirement for masks to be worn can be waived when carrying out, in the course of employment, an activity that requires that no mask may be worn, or that it must be removed in order that other equipment may be worn or used, to carry out that activity, or when riding a motorcycle in the course of employment or otherwise.\nE.g. humid workplaces, call centres where the nature of the work may necessitate frequent mask changing.\nFor the full list of workplaces where SafeEntry must be deployed, please refer to https://www.safeentry.gov.sg/deployment.\nSuch as tele-conferencing.\nNot applicable for individuals seeking treatment at a medical facility.\nNot applicable to COVID-19 frontline workers or recovered individuals within 3 months of their first positive PCR COVID-19 test.\nE.g. barriers between workstations, relocation of workstations, meeting room seats.\nThe monitoring and enforcement of safe distancing could be aided by appropriate technology (e.g. CCTVs, video analytics) where possible.\nSuch as counters where customers are served, rooms where visitors are hosted, as well as general public access areas such as lifts, pantries, toilets, and bin areas (including bin centres where necessary).\nhttps://www.nea.gov.sg/our-services/public-cleanliness/environmental-cleaning-guidelines\nIncluding coughing, sneezing, breathlessness, a runny nose, or loss of sense of smell.\nData recorded by TraceTogether is stored on the user’s device, and is shared with MOH for contact-tracing purposes when the user is suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19.\nIncluding but not limited to typical symptoms such as fever, cough and shortness of breath.\nE.g. follow-up on non-compliance and efforts to mitigate risks.\nEmployers should note that interns, part-time staff, etc. who are under a contract of service are also employees.",

Page 3 of 16\nStipulated occupancy limits\n6. From 16 May through 13 June 2021, the occupancy limit for all malls and large \nstandalone stores > 930 sqm (or 10,000 sqft) of GFA will be one person per 16 sqm of \nGFA6\n.\n7. All other stores (e.g. shops within malls, at HDB residential blocks, at MRT stations or \nbus interchanges) are not required to adhere to these occupancy limits as long as at \nleast one-metre distancing between individual customers or groups of customers who \nare shopping together (up to 2 persons) is maintained.\nSafe Management Measures – Customer-facing operations/Front-of-house\n8. The following measures apply to all customer-facing operations of retail establishments\nand lifestyle-related services. \n8.1. Safe distancing \n8.1.1. Retail establishments are to ensure at least one-metre spacing between \ngroups of customers (of up to 2 persons). \n8.1.2. Retail establishments are to clearly demarcate queue lines for customers \nat entrances, cashier counters, weighing counters, fitting rooms and must \nensure at least one-metre spacing between individual customers in the \nqueue (e.g. using floor markers).\n8.1.3. Employees must manage queues to ensure that safe distancing is \nobserved at all times.\n8.2. Crowd management\n8.2.1. Activities and events at public and common areas such as mall atriums,\npublic transport nodes, HDB estates and common corridors are not \nallowed7\n. Retail establishments should cancel all events and promotions \nduring this period that will generate crowding at their physical premises \nin a manner which is non-compliant with the Safe Management \nMeasures. \n8.2.2. Operators of common play areas for children/toddlers/infants in retail \nstores or malls8 must ensure at least one-metre spacing between groups \nof customers.\n8.3. Contact tracing \n8.3.1. The following retail establishments are required to deploy SafeEntry9\nto \nlog the check-in of customers, vendors and visitors to their premises10:\n• Malls and large standalone stores;\n• Large retail stores > 930 sqm or 10,000 sqft;\n• Supermarkets;\n• Personal care services e.g. hairdressers, barbers, spas, beauty and \nwellness; and\n• Facilities providing basic pet services (that do not function on a drop\u0002off, pick-up basis).\n6 For mixed-use developments, GFA refers to the retail component only.\n7 Such activities may be allowed for supermarkets on a case-by-case basis, if an extension of existing retail space \nis deemed necessary to ensure safe distancing. Approval must be sought from ESG.\n8 These play areas refer to the facilities provided free-of-charge in the shops or at the malls’ common areas. \n9 More information on SafeEntry and a full list of places where SafeEntry must be deployed can be found at \nhttps://covid.gobusiness.gov.sg/safemanagement/safeentry/\n10 However, all retail establishments and lifestyle-related services must require their employees to do SafeEntry \ncheck-in. They must transit to TraceTogether-only SafeEntry when this is implemented from 17 May 2021.Page 4 of 16\n8.3.2. From 17 May 2021, TraceTogether-only SafeEntry will be implemented \nat the above establishments. Refer to Annex A for details on the \nSafeEntry implementation.\n8.3.3. From 15 June 2021, retail establishments required to deploy \nSafeEntry for customers and visitors will need to provide the \nSafeEntry Gateway11 (SEGW) as an option for SafeEntry check-in.\nSEGW is available as a feature within the SafeEntry (Business) App\n(updated to version 1.1.0 and above) and as a physical standalone device \n(SEGW Box). These establishments may apply for a free SEGW Box12\n. \n8.4. Health checks\n8.4.1. All malls, large standalone stores, supermarkets and stores providing \npersonal care and beauty services must conduct temperature \nscreening13\n, employees must check for visible symptoms14 for customers \nat entrances, and turn away those with fever and/or who appear unwell15\n. \n8.5. Cleanliness and hygiene\n8.5.1. All employees, customers, delivery personnel and other onsite personnel \nmust put on their masks properly at all times.\n8.5.2. Hand sanitisers should be made available to employees and customers \nat common touchpoints (e.g. entry/exit doors, cashiers). \n8.5.3. Product testers and samples for self-application and immediate \nconsumption, e.g. perfume testers, make-up testers and unsealed food \nsamples, are not allowed. Employees must also not apply the product \nsample directly on customers.\n8.5.4. Retail establishments must ensure frequent cleaning and disinfection of:\n• Common spaces such as counters and display shelves, where \ncustomers are served, as well as play areas for \nchildren/toddlers/infants;\n• Items such as shopping trolleys/baskets and handrails, which have\nhigh human contact; and\n• Interactive hardware such as iPads, mall directories, self-checkout \nkiosks or lift buttons.\n9. Retail establishments should put up clear signages to remind customers to comply with \nsafe management requirements where applicable, and train and deploy service \npersonnel to provide clear communication to customers on SMMs.\n10. Refer to Annex B for other recommended guidelines, and Annex C on guidance for \nspecific trades.\n11 The SEGW enables contactless detection of both the TraceTogether App and Token, and serves as an additional \nmeans of SafeEntry check-in that is quicker and more seamless. It also allows users to check if their Token has \nrun out of battery or is not working. \n12 Refer to go.gov.sg/gateway-overview for how to implement the SEGW and apply for a free SEGW Box. \n13 Individuals with temperatures above 38 degrees Celsius are considered as having a fever. Supermarkets and \nstores providing beauty services in malls need not conduct temperature screening and checks on visible symptoms \nfor customers if the mall is already doing so. They should, however, do so if they operate outside the mall hours.\n14 Notable visible symptoms to look out for include: (a) coughing; (b) sneezing; (c) breathlessness; and (d) a runny \nnose.\n15 Except where the individual is entering the permitted premises to seek medical treatment for a specific symptom.Page 5 of 16\nSafe Management Measures – Workplace premises16\n11. To ensure COVID-safe workplaces, retail establishments should take care of their \nworkers, workplaces and those who may become unwell at their workplaces, as outlined \nin MOM’s Requirements for Safe Management Measures at the Workplace. \nEnforcement of measures\n12. Government agencies will be conducting inspections to check on the proper \nimplementation of the SMMs. Under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act \npassed in Parliament on 7 April 2020, first-time offenders will face a fine of up to \nS$10,000, imprisonment of up to six months, or both. For subsequent offences, \nthey may face a fine of up to S$20,000, imprisonment of up to twelve months, or \nboth.\n13. Businesses that do not implement or comply with the government’s SMMs may be \nineligible for government grants, loans, tax rebates and other assistance, and may also \nbe subject to temporary closures.\nAnnex A – Details of SafeEntry check-in and TraceTogether-only SafeEntry implementation\nAnnex B – Other recommended guidelines for customer-facing operations \nAnnex C – Trade-specific Safe Management Measures for Retail Establishments and \nLifestyle-Related Services\nIssued by:\nEnterprise Singapore\nHousing & Development Board\nSingapore Tourism Board\nUrban Redevelopment Authority\nUpdated as of 18 May 2021\n_________________________________________________________________________\n16 Refers to the retail establishments’ back-of-house operations involving employees, including at offices, \nwarehouses and manufacturing facilities.Page 6 of 16\nANNEX A\nDetails of SafeEntry check-in and TraceTogether-only SafeEntry implementation\n- Before 17 May 2021, SafeEntry check-in can be done by: \ni) Scanning of the SafeEntry QR code using a QR code scanner on a smartphone;\nii) Using the SingPass App;\niii) Using the TraceTogether App;\niv) Presenting the TraceTogether Token QR code or ID card to the camera/2D scanner \nlinked to SafeEntry (Business) App for scanning; or\nv) Bringing the TraceTogether Token or App close to a SEGW.\n- From 17 May 2021, when TraceTogether-only SafeEntry is implemented at the retail \nestablishments (as listed in paragraph 8.3.1)17, SafeEntry check-in can only be done by: \ni) Scanning the SafeEntry QR code using the TraceTogether App;\nii) Presenting the TraceTogether Token QR code to the camera/2D scanner linked to \nSafeEntry (Business) App for scanning; or \niii) Bringing the TraceTogether Token or App close to a SEGW. \n- To help ease the transition, scanning of barcodes on ID cards will be retained until 31 May \n2021. Following which, ID cards can only be used under extenuating circumstances. For \nmore information, please refer to the FAQs on www.safeentry.gov.sg.\n- In addition, from 15 June 2021, retail establishments required to deploy SafeEntry \nfor customers and visitors will need to provide the SEGW as an option for SafeEntry \ncheck-in. SEGW is available as a feature within the SafeEntry (Business) App (updated \nto version 1.1.0 and above) and as a physical standalone device (SEGW Box). These \nestablishments may apply for a free SEGW Box18\n. \n- To prepare for the implementation of TraceTogether-only SafeEntry, the above retail \nestablishments should already accept TraceTogether Tokens as a mode of \nSafeEntry check-in19. Businesses that accept ID cards for check-in will be able to accept \nToken for check-in if they are already using: i) A smartphone loaded with the SafeEntry \n(Business) App setup; ii) a laptop and scanner setup if the scanner can scan barcode and \nQR code; or iii) a SEGW App or SEGW Box. \n- For avoidance of doubt, TraceTogether Token check-in and SEGW both refer to the mode \nof check-in, while TraceTogether-only SafeEntry refers to the overall programme which \nwill permit only TraceTogether modes of check-in (i.e. TraceTogether App or Token). \n- After TraceTogether-only SafeEntry is implemented from 17 May 2021: \ni) Large retail stores > 930 sqm (or 10,000 sqft) and supermarkets located within a \nTraceTogether-only SafeEntry building (e.g. malls) that have the same operating hours \nas the building will no longer be required to deploy SafeEntry check-in for customers, \nvendors and visitors. Those located within a TraceTogether-only SafeEntry building\nbut with longer operating hours must implement TraceTogether-only SafeEntry outside \nthe building’s operating hours.\n17 All retail establishments must require their employees to do SafeEntry check-in using TraceTogether-only \nSafeEntry when this is implemented from 17 May 2021. \n18 Refer to go.gov.sg/gateway-overview for how to implement the SEGW and apply for a free SEGW Box. \n19 TraceTogether Token check-in is done by premises scanning the QR codes on the TraceTogether Tokens of \ncustomers, vendors and visitors. Refer to https://go.gov.sg/token-scanning to find out how to implement Token \ncheck-in mode.Page 7 of 16\nii) Small retail stores (< 930 sqm or 10,000 sqft) that were not required to deploy \nSafeEntry for customers but have voluntarily done so, should remove their SafeEntry \ncheck-ins.Page 8 of 16\nANNEX B\nOther recommended guidelines for customer-facing operations\nA. Queue management\n- Queues should not cause congestion for neighbouring establishments or at other parts \nof the mall.\nB. Crowd management\n- Limit groups of customers entering the store to no more than 2 persons. \n- Do not hold activities that would attract large crowds inside and outside of the retail \nestablishment (e.g. celebrity appearances, aggressive shopping deals, closed-door \nmembers sales).\n- A standard operating procedure (SOP) should be put in place to manage long queues \nand large crowds that could form inside or outside stores (e.g. where popular products\nare displayed) and/or the mall.\n- Encourage the use of self-checkout, and cashless or contactless payment to reduce \ncontact between employees and customers. \n- Encourage customers to book appointments, for the viewing and testing of products, \nas well as for services (e.g. consultation, repairs). \n- Consider placing frequently purchased goods and necessities near the entrance or \ncheckout to facilitate movement and reduce in-store dwell time.\n- Operators should take additional steps to manage the capacity within common play \nareas for children/toddlers/infants (e.g. deploying an employee to man the area), \nwhere practicable.\nC. Health checks\n- All retail stores not mandated to conduct temperature screening and not located within \nmalls are encouraged to do so and check for visible symptoms where practicable.\nD. Cleanliness and hygiene\n- Limit display and testing of products, e.g. stationery, laptops, mobile phones, etc. \nEmployees to conduct product demonstrations if required. Such products should also \nbe sanitised regularly.\n- Where possible, place hand sanitisers in close proximity of store entrances, high-touch \nsurfaces like door handles, as well as common play areas. Encourage customers to \nsanitise their hands before entering stores and/or handling products on display.\n- Supermarkets and other retail establishments which provide trolleys and baskets to \ntheir customers are encouraged to provide disinfectant wipes for customers to clean \nthe handles of such trolleys and baskets. \n- Products that customers touch frequently such as clothes, footwear, jewellery, \naccessories and optical products, should be cleaned, sanitised or sterilised frequently, \nwhere possible.\nE. Encourage online retail, and “click & collect” for goods and delivery\n- Encourage online retail and click-and-collect from store, to reduce dwell time\n- Where practicable, collection and delivery from the store must be spaced out and \ncontactless. \n- Take reasonable steps to ensure that delivery personnel observe at least one-metre \nspacing at all times and do not cluster together. Page 9 of 16\n- Refer to the Advisory for Delivery Businesses for guidelines on delivery requirements.\nF. Use of retail establishments as a third-party venue for work-related events\n- If a retail outlet is used as a third-party event space, as a best practice, only one event \nshould be held in the outlet at a time. If not feasible, each third-party event should be \nclearly demarcated from the others, as well as from the main consumer shopping area. \nEach area should be kept completely separate by either a solid partition (at least 1.8-\nmetre high, from wall to wall), or a minimum 3-metre spacing demarcated by \ncontinuous physical barriers (e.g. plexiglass screens, barricade tape, queue poles). \nThere should be no mixing or intermingling of guests from separate events.

          "context": "Dormitory Residents\n12 August 2020 Measures for Dormitory Residents to Enjoy Safe Rest Days As the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) has cleared all dormitories1 on 11 August 2020, the next step is to work towards allowing dormitory residents to leave for leisure and personal errands, while keeping them safe from Covid-19. MOM recognises that such social activity is important for the mental well-being of the residents. The eventual goal is to allow residents from cleared dorms to enjoy their rest days without movement restrictions. 2 We will move towards this goal in a measured way because we need to ensure that the residents and the broader community are kept safe and healthy. We also bear s that led to new waves of Covid-19 infection. To this end, MOM has engaged employers, NGOs, dormitory operators and Recreation Centre operators to coordinate this important undertaking. 3 MOM will start small-scale trials this month for residents from selected cleared dormitories to visit Recreation Centres on their rest days for personal errands such as buying groceries, SIM cards and remitting money. 4 To reduce crowding outside the dormitories on rest days, residebe spread out across each day. This will be done by residents needing to apply for a Dormitory Exit Pass through their SGWorkPass app, which will provide a specific exit timeslot. Residents in participating dormitories that meet all the following criteria will be granted an Exit Pass: i) Has recovered from Covid-19, or has a negative swab test result within 14 days prior to the exit date; ii) Not be on Quarantine Order or Stay Home Notice; iii) Is staying in a cleared dormitory; iv) Has installed and registered TraceTogether; and v) Chooses an Exit Pass timeslot with available vacancies. 5 The trials will allow us to refine the Exit Pass arrangements so as to progressively ramp up the number of participating dormitories over the next two months. Details of the eventual Exit Pass arrangements will be announced in due course. We aim to have all dormitory residents able to apply for Exit Passes to visit Recreation Centres in October 2020. The limits on exit duration and destinations will be reviewed after October 2020, taking into account Covid-19 transmission trends then. 6 BCA, EDB and ESG, with the support of industry associations, have also announced measures to stagger the rest days of their workers so as to help reduce crowding. We also welcome community and NGO efforts to expand programmes and initiatives in the dormitories so that there are more options for the residents during their rest day. 1 to be free from Covid-19. New infections can still occur. If our monitoring picks up potential infections, all at-risk residents will be quickly isolated and quarantined as a precautionary measure. 7 -operation over these last four months and understand their anxieties. We seek the cooperation of all stakeholders to ensure that dormitory residents can eventually enjoy their rest day safely. <End> Issued by: Ministry of Manpower Association of Singapore Marine Industries (ASMI) Association of Process Industry (ASPRI) Crisis Relief Alliance (CRA) Dormitory Association of Singapore Limited (DASL) Healthserve Humanitarian Organisation for Migration Economics (HOME) ItsRainingRaincoats (IRR) National Volunteer & Philanthropy Centre (NVPC) Sama Sama Singapore Contractors Association Limited (SCAL) Specialists Trade Alliance of Singapore (STAS) Transient Workers Count Too (TWC2) Frequently Asked Questions Q1. Why is there a need to regulate the entry and exit of dormitory residents? The precautions necessary to protect the residents when they leave the dormitories for work or leisure as well as the broader community. Otherwise if a Covid-19 cluster were to form, it will adversely affect the dormitories, the workplaces as well as the larger community. Q2. Can dormitory operators or employers choose to disallow workers from going to the recreation centres (RC)? Dormitory operators and employers cannot disallow workers with an Exit Pass to exit the dormitory to go to the RC. Q3. Can eligible workers apply to leave their dormitories to attend to urgent matters? What will happen if they leave their dormitories without permission? Workers whose dormitory is declared COVID-cleared and are not serving a Quarantine Order or Stay-Home Notice can leave the dormitory to run essential errands without the need for an Exit Pass. The list of essential errands are as follows: a) Collection of passport; b) Work Pass related errands (i.e. medical examination at clinics, capturing of biometrics for issuance of new work pass cards, attending Settling in Programme, submission of documents at MOMSC, endorsement of In-Principle Approval (IPA) for Work Permit Letter by Building and Construction Authority); c) Medical appointments (i.e. services that are not available at primary care medical post); d) Dental appointments; e) Banking services (i.e. Activation/ re-activation of bank account, setting up of online banking account or requesting of bank account details; completion of onboarding process and security checks for collection of ATM card; and closure of bank account); and f) Court Hearings (Work Injury Compensation Act, Employment Claims Tribunal, State Court, High Court and includes investigations and related activities). Workers can proceed to leave the dormitory for the above essential errands after employers or dormitory operators have submitted the following information to MOM at www.mom.gov.sg/essential-errands-request: a) b) Details of the essential errand and corresponding documentation; and c) Date and time that the worker will be carrying out the errand. If workers need to leave their dormitories for any other urgent personal matters that are not specified in the list of essential errands, they must first seek the permission from MOM through their employers or dormitory operators.",

Wedding organisers (which could include venue operators/ owners1, wedding planners, the wedding couple and/ or their relatives/ friends) responsible for supplying or procuring the premises and any goods and services related to the wedding (whether or not for reward and whether jointly or otherwise) are required to put in place the following safe management measures. This set of Safe Management Measures applies with effect from 28 Dec 2020. 1. Overall 1.1. Prevailing rules applying to each entity/ venue will continue to apply. Venue owners may determine if and when to allow solemnizations and wedding receptions to be held in their premises, and may set additional conditions for their use, based on their capacity or ability to ensure safe management measures are implemented. 1.2. It is recommended that organisers appoint a Safe Management Officer to ensure that safe management measures are adhered to. 1.3. The Solemnizer may postpone the solemnization if safe management measures are not implemented or adhered to for the solemnization. 1.4. For external venues (excluding home, ROM(M) Building and places of worship), organisers should prepare response plans to manage situations such as handling unwell guests. This includes ensuring staff are familiar with the procedures in the handling of unwell and/ or uncooperative guests. 1.5. Each event must be completed in the same calendar day, although marriage solemnizations and wedding receptions may be held on separate days. 1.6. Each event can only be held in a single venue managed by the same operator. The event may take place over multiple rooms within the same venue. 1.7. In a place of residence, only marriage solemnizations are allowed, and not receptions (which involve food and beverage). 2. Limits on Number of Attendees 2.1. Where held in an external venue (i.e. outside the ROM(M) Building or a place of residence), the maximum number of attendees for the entire event must not exceed a total of 100 persons or a lower number, depending on venue capacity, safe distancing measures and/ or other factors to be determined by the venue owner/ operator or organisers. If the total number of attendees is between 50 to 100 persons, attendees must be split into either multiple zones of up to 50 persons, or across staggered timings with up to 50 persons in each slot and at least 30 minutes between slots.

The guest list for solemnizations and wedding receptions should be made available onsite for verification/ checking. 3. Group Size and Safe Distancing 3.1. For weddings held in external venues (i.e. outside the ROM(M) Building or a place of residence), guests must be split into fixed groups of up to 8 persons each, with no intermingling or mixing between groups. This will also apply within each zone and time slot. 3.2. An exception may be made for a designated core comprising up to 20 persons (including the bride and groom), which is part of the 100 persons. Individuals in this may interact with one another within the party and may sit with one another at tables of more than 8 persons. However, they must not intermingle or mix with other attendees outside the 3.3. At least 1m safe distancing must be observed between groups, as well as between the and other groups, at all times, including for photo-taking. 4. Zoning Requirements 4.1. For weddings held in external venues (i.e. outside the ROM(M) Building or a place of residence), the maximum number of attendees in each zone must not exceed a total of 50 persons. 4.2.

Zones must be completely separated from one another by either a physical solid partition (at least 1.8m high, from wall to wall); or at least 3m physical spacing demarcated by continuous physical barriers (e.g. formed by plexiglass screens, barricade tape, queue pole stands linked by retractable belts). 2 For example, if there are 6 persons currently living in your household, the 6 residents and an additional 8 visitors can attend a marriage solemnization in your home.

Pre-meal receptions (free-standing) are not allowed. 7.3. Where possible, organisers should identify hotspots e.g. entry/ exit points, washrooms, corridors, etc. for potential bunching and implement a control mechanism to prevent/ disperse crowds.

          "context": "how singapore is ensuring access to covid 19 vaccines\nSingapore became the first nation in Asia to receive doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on 21 December 2020, thanks to a coordinated approach between the Government, the scientific community and industry partners. Soon after the COVID-19 outbreak began, the wheels in Singapore’s efforts to secure vaccines began turning as the Government began closely monitoring the global development of vaccines. An early startIn April 2020, a Therapeutics and Vaccines expert panel (TxVax panel) was formed to source for vaccine candidates around the world. The panel, comprising 18 scientists and clinicians across hospitals, A*STAR and the private sector, conducted an extensive study of 35 promising candidates to screen them for safety and efficacy.\nThe TxVax panel relies on data that comes from the different vaccine companies at their respective stages of clinical trials. The clinical trial process, which involves testing an experimental drug or vaccine, has three phases. The first two phases are typically carried out among smaller groups to test the vaccine’s safety and efficacy. Researchers assess how the human immune system is responding to the vaccine and monitor for possible side effects. Trials in the third phase are significantly larger, often involving thousands of people across multiple countries. This phase determines if the vaccine can protect users from the infection. As more data was released across the different stages of the trials, the TxVax panel updated and refined their assessments, and passed their recommendations to a group of planners.Diversifying vaccine options Given the lack of certainty over which vaccine would succeed, the planning group diversified the choices across different vaccine technology platforms.\nThe Economic Development Board (EDB) also weighed in on the criteria for choosing the vaccines. “The 35 (vaccine candidates) that we looked at very seriously, we had already pre-screened, based on certain characteristics like the technology type, who is developing it, the track record and the timeline of development,” said Ms. Lisa Ooi, EDB’s Vice President of Healthcare and Wellness Strategy. Given the variety of vaccines types, there needed to be a “balance between established options and fastest to the market”, Ms. Ooi added.\nAssessment and monitoring of the vaccinesOver the months, the planning group made careful assessments of the different vaccines before deciding which to purchase. Vaccines from Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech and Sinovac have been purchased, and there are ongoing efforts to procure others to ensure a diversified range of options. As the Ministry of Health negotiated the commercial agreements, the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) reviewed the clinical trial data to guide Singapore’s vaccine review process. COVID-19 vaccines approved for use, such as the Pfizer-BioNTech one, have gone through a thorough review for safety. Professor Benjamin Seet, Deputy Group CEO (Education & Research) at the National Healthcare Group explained more about the process.“While mRNA vaccines (such as the Pfizer-BioNTech one) are new and there are some uncertainties, when you look at the clinical trials as well as the scientific review, it is very rigorous.”\nAs the drug is used in Singapore, companies will continue to work with HSA to monitor any side effects.\nEnsuring early access The planning group collaborated with the vaccine producers to ensure that delivery schedules were met, even roping in our national carrier, Singapore Airlines, so that there were flights from airports near where the vaccines were produced. When the vaccines arrive in Singapore, they will be kept in cold chain facilities, where they can be stored for months. Following that, the vaccines will be transported to the sites where they will be administered. There are also ongoing efforts to establish vaccine production facilities in Singapore. Thermo Fisher Scientific, one of the world’s largest life sciences company, recently announced that it would establish a new US$130m facility in Singapore in 2022. Several other companies are also in the final stages of talks to invest in new vaccine production plants here. Made possible by a strong partnership\nSingapore is one of the first countries to obtain the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. The 11 months it took from when the virus first arrived in Singapore to when we received our first shipment of vaccines on 21 December 2020 was no fluke. It was due to the team of public officers, scientists and industry partners who worked tirelessly behind the scenes to make early access to vaccines possible. The road to vaccine procurement was fraught with uncertainty but with the shipment now on our shores, Singapore is now ready to roll-out its vaccination plan for our residents.*Photo (used in banner image) by the Ministry of Communications and Information",

The Multi-Ministry Taskforce (MTF) announced on 14 December 2020 that Singapore will start Phase Three of re-opening from 28 December 2020, which will allow for further re-opening of activities in the community. 2. The Multi-Ministry Taskforce had outlined three pre-conditions for moving into Phase Three, which each of us has contributed to in the past few months: 2.1. Adherence to safe management measures. Most businesses and members of the public have been cooperating with safe management measures, and these efforts have helped keep community transmission low. 2.2. Sufficient testing capabilities for early detection and public health action. We have ramped up Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test capacity significantly to be able to run over 50,000 tests a day. We have also introduced antigen rapid tests for larger and higher-risk events. 2.3. High adoption of TraceTogether for quick and effective contact tracing. As at 13 December, around 65% of Singapore residents are on the TraceTogether Programme, and we are on track to reaching the target of around 70% by the end of the year. 3. In Phase 3, Singapore needs to continue to remain united and disciplined in our fight against COVID-19. This includes the hotel1 industry. The information in this circular (which includes its annexes) supersedes that in previous advisories or statements. A. Implementation of Safe Management Measures 4. Operators of hotels are permitted enterprises allowed to open their premises to carry on the business of providing accommodation. SMMs and certain restrictions specifically for hotels. As updated, they are: 4.1. Hotels must comply with the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations 20202 and, where applicable, the COVID19 (Temporary Measures) 1 means a hotel and any other similar building or boarding premises, not being a dormitory for foreign employees, a hostel or a public institution - (a) in which persons are lodged for hire or reward of any kind (whether or not the cost of such hire or reward is paid for by such persons); and (b) where domestic service is provided by the owner, lessee, tenant, occupier or manager for the person so lodged 2 -S254-2020 2 (Performances and Other Activities Control Order) Regulations 20203 (collectively ) as well as the SMMs found in Annex A. 4.2. Hotels must not carry on business as Stay-Home-Notice Dedicated Facilities Government Quarantine Facilities , and Swab Isolation 4 without contracting with the Government. 4.3. Hotels must not allocate accommodation (e.g. accept bookings) to individuals for the purposes of leisure5 (i.e. provide leisure bookings) without the prior written permission of MTI. 5. Since 19 June 2020, hotels may resume operations for certain facilities on their premises, subject to compliance with Sector Specific Requirements6 in addition to the Control Order. These are summarised below: 5.1. Dine-in facilities must comply with the prevailing multi-agency Sector Specific Requirements for F&B establishments. 5.2.

          "context": "Massage\nUpdated as of 28 December 2020 Advisory on the Implementation of TraceTogether-only SafeEntry Mode for Massage Establishments (MEs) and Update of Safe Management Measures for MEs Dear Sir/Mdm, Implementation of TraceTogether-only SafeEntry Mode for MEs 1. The Ministerial Task Force (MTF) has announced that TraceTogether-only SafeEntry (TT-only SE) will be made mandatory at all venues at which SafeEntry must be deployed, after everyone who wants a TraceTogether Token has had a chance to collect one at a community club or centre in their constituencies. The exact date for which TT-only SE will be mandated will be announced in due course and could be as early as January 2021. When made mandatory, MEs must transit to TT-only SE. [Note: TT-only SE will replace SafeEntry. Individuals entering premises where TT-only SE is implemented will have to use either their TraceTogether App or TraceTogether Token to check in. Foreigners who are pass holders can register for the TraceTogether app using their FIN and/or collect their TraceTogether tokens from designated collection points.] 2. While you are currently not required to activate TT-only SE yet, you are advised to implement TraceTogether Token check-in mode at your MEs now, if you have not done so. This will ensure a smoother transition for your business when TT-only SE is mandated. 3. For a step-by-step guide to set up TraceTogether Token scanning for your venue using either the SafeEntry (Business) Mobile App on a smartphone or SafeEntry (Business) Web App on a laptop connected to a 2D scanner, you may refer to -scanning. Should you encounter any problem, you can submit a helpdesk query through the SafeEntry website. 4. In addition, you may also make use of the available posters at -se-comms-kit to educate your staff and customers on the upcoming TT-only SE requirements. 5. Please update the Police Licensing & Regulatory Department via email at SPF_PLRD_GLD @spf.gov.sg after you have implemented the Token check-in mode at your ME, and the date from which it was implemented. Update of Safe Management Measures for MEs 6. The Safe Management Measures (SMMs) for MEs have been updated, as attached in Annex A. The updates are highlighted in yellow, and includes the clarification on the requirement for SafeEntry to be implemented at your ME. 7. Other than the above, the additional measures in Annex B are also attached for your easy reference. ME operators are again strongly encouraged to implement these additional measures to minimise the risk of COVID-19 transmission on their premises. 8. -19/requirements-for-safe-management-measures for more details on work-place specific SMMs, and joint advisories issued by ESG, STB, SFA, HDB and URA on general safety and crowd management. These are accessible at -19/safe-distance. Liability and Responsibility of Operators 9. ME operators who do not comply with the above requirements may be liable for an offence under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act 2020 and may face a fine not exceeding $10,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months, or both, for the first offence. Higher penalties of a fine of not exceeding $20,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding twelve months, or both, will apply for subsequent offences. Failure to comply with these requirements may also result in ineligibility for any Government support, such as rental rebates and wage support. 10. ME operators should also ensure that the requirements under the Massage Establishments Act, the rules made thereunder, and all licensing conditions imposed, are strictly complied with at all times. Any non-compliance with the relevant laws may result in regulatory action, including but not limited to prosecution and revocation of ME licences. 11. ME operators are encouraged to regularly check the following websites and Regulations for the prevailing SMMs that apply for your MEs: a. GoBusiness website at ; and b. the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations 2020. Contact Information 12. For further queries, please contact the Police Licensing & Regulatory Department at Tel: 6835 0000 or via email at SPF_PLRD_GLD@spf.gov.sg. Annex A Safe Management Measures for Massage Establishments To continue providing a safe environment for your employees and customers, all MEs must adhere to the requirements as prescribed in the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations 2020. In addition, all MEs must comply with the Safe Management Measures (SMMs) listed below, which can also be found on the GoBusiness website at ov.sg/safemanagement/sector/. These measures are meant to minimise the risk of re-emergence and transmission of COVID-19 in the community. Safe Management Measures for MEs SafeEntry Visitor Management System i. Control access and use SafeEntry visitor management system to record the entry of all personnel (including staff and customers) entering the premises.1 The deployment of the SafeEntry visitor management system should be done in addition to the requirement for ME licensees to maintain a register of clients, as specified under Rule 14 of the ME Rules 2018. Safe Distancing ii. All onsite personnel, including customers, staff, suppliers, and contractors should wear a mask at all times, including during the provision of massage services. iii. The number of customers within the premises should be strictly limited to ensure adherence to the 1 metre spacing requirement between them. However, this will not apply to the masseuse during the provision of the massage service to the customer. iv. Where there are multiple massage chairs or beds in a common space, they should be placed at least 1 metre apart. Alternatively, only alternate seats or beds should be occupied at any one time such that a minimum of 1 metre distance between customers is maintained at all times. Cleanliness and Hygiene v. Conduct regular cleaning and disinfection of the premises and items, particularly areas with high human contact. Common spaces such as waiting areas, counters, toilets and staff pantries should be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected regularly. Items such as towels should be changed and washed, and massage beds and chairs should be cleaned and disinfected after each use. 1 More information on SafeEntry and a full list of places where SafeEntry must be deployed can be found at Note that SafeEntry can be done via QR code/NRIC scanning, via TraceTogether (app or Token scanning), or manual entry of NRIC number & particulars through a dedicated device. Businesses should not decline entry to visitors unless the individual does not use SafeEntry QR, or SafeEntry NRIC application or TraceTogether and refuses to provide particulars to assist with manual entry. Management of Unwell Staff vi. Ensure that all staff who had visited a clinic submit records of their MCs, and diagnoses provided (only for COVID-19-related symptoms, including acute respiratory infection), and inform the ME operators if they had been tested for COVID-19 and the results of their tests. All ME operators are to ensure that staff returning to work after completing their MCs are well before allowing the staff to enter the premises. vii. In the event of a confirmed case among the staff or customer, ME operator must inform Police Licensing & Regulatory Department immediately and temporarily suspend operations. All staff who had been in close contact with the confirmed case shall be placed on Leave of Absence for 14 days (if not already issued with a Quarantine Order by MOH). viii. Implement a follow-up plan with precautionary measures in the event of a confirmed case, including immediately vacating the premises where the confirmed case had worked and thorough cleaning and disinfecting of all relevant on-site areas and assets that were exposed to confirmed cases. Monitoring the Implementation of SMMs ix. Implement a detailed monitoring plan to ensure compliance with SMMs and that issues are resolved in a timely manner (e.g. remedy of non-compliance, risk mitigation). x. Appoint Safe Management Officer(s) (SMO) to assist in the implementation, coordination and monitoring of the system of SMMs at the premises. Duties of the SMO include conducting inspections and checks to ensure that SMMs are complied with at all times and keeping records of the checks which may be requested by the authorities. Where non-compliance of SMMs are found during the inspections, the SMO will also remedy the non-compliance with immediate action. 2. ME operators must put up clear signages to remind staff and customers of the above measures (in Para 1). 3. In addition to the measures prescribed in the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations 2020 as well as the SMMs for MEs listed above, all ME operators are strongly encouraged to put in place additional measures provided in the Annex B, to further reduce the risk of outbreak of COVID-19 at your premises. 4. All ME operators must continue to ensure that the above SMMs are implemented, communicated and explained to all staff.",

          "context": "Mahjong Rooms\nConditions for Resumption of Operations for Mahjong Rooms in Private Entities We refer to the latest announcement from the Ministry of 2020. Private mahjong (or gambling) rooms may be allowed to resume operations from 4 July 2020, subject to the operators implementing the required Safe Management Measures (SMMs). 2. To provide a safe environment for all staff and members, operators of these private mahjong (or gambling) rooms must comply with the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations 2020. requirements on workplace-specific SMMs at -19/requirements-for-safe-management-measures, and adhere to the advisories issued by the relevant agencies (e.g. ESG, STB, SFA, HDB and URA) on general safety and crowd management at -19/safe-distance, and implement the appropriate measures. In particular, workplaces with private mahjong (or gambling) rooms are reminded to comply with workplace specific-SMMs in addition to the SMMs listed below. 3. In addition, private mahjong (or gambling) rooms should also comply with sector-specific SMMs, as listed below. a. Put up signs to remind staff and members to observe all SMMs in place at all times. b. Implement a detailed monitoring plan to ensure compliance with SMMs and that issues are resolved in a timely manner (e.g. remedy of non-compliance, risk mitigation). c. Appoint Safe Management Officer(s) (SMO) to assist in the implementation, coordination and monitoring of the system of SMMs at the premises. Duties of the SMO include the training of other staff to engage members to comply with SMMs, conducting inspections and checks to ensure that SMMs are complied with at all times, and keeping records of the checks which may be requested by the authorities. d. Implement a follow-up plan with precautionary measures in the event of a confirmed case, including immediately vacating the premises where the confirmed case had been and thoroughly cleaning and disinfecting all relevant on-site areas and assets that were exposed to confirmed cases. e. In the event of a confirmed case among the staff or members, the operator must temporarily suspend all operations. All staff who had been in close contact with the confirmed case shall be placed on Leave of Absence for 14 days (if not already issued with a Quarantine Order by MOH). f. Limit and control the number of persons in the private mahjong (or gambling) rooms to the number of participants permitted in the Schedule of the Common Gaming Houses (Private Bodies Exemption) Notification. g. Ensure clear physical spacing of at least 1m between groups of no more than 5 individuals. The 1m distance between groups should be measured from the outermost edges of each group (e.g. shoulder to shoulder, back to back, or closest edges of seats). There should be no mixing or interaction between the groups. h. Ensure all gambling equipment and tables (e.g. mahjong tiles and tables) are cleaned and disinfected at the end of each session for each group, before the next group uses them. 4. Additional guidelines to enhance measures at private mahjong (or gambling) rooms are listed in Annex A. Operators are strongly encouraged to implement these measures to minimise the risk of re-emergence and transmission of COVID-19 in the community. This would prevent a situation where a private mahjong (or gambling) room has to be suspended or closed, following the detection of COVID-19 case(s). 5. All operators must comply with all the requirements as stated in the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations. Operators who do not comply with the requirements as stated in the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations may be directed to close their private mahjong (or gambling) rooms under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act 2020. Operators who do not comply may also be liable for an offence under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act 2020, with a fine up to $10,000 or imprisonment for up to 6 months, or both, for first time offenders. Higher penalties of a fine of up to $20,000, imprisonment of up to twelve months, or both, may apply for subsequent offences.

As of 22 January 2021, More than 60,000 individuals have received their first does of the vaccine, including staff working in healthcare, nursing home, frontline and essential services, as well as seniors in our nursing home. 39 staff at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases have also received their second dose of vaccine and completed the full vaccination regimen.Vaccinations for seniorsFrom 27 January 2021, vaccination for seniors will commence, starting with pilots in Ang Mo Kio and Tanjong Pagar, where larger numbers of seniors reside. Vaccinations will be progressively extended to seniors across the island from mid-February 2021.All seniors will receive personalised letters inviting them to make an appointment for their vaccinations. They can make appointments online, or book one in person at Community Centres. Community volunteers from People’s Association and Silver Generation Ambassadors will be conducting house visits and tapping on grassroots events to help seniors and answer their queries. Should they need further assistance, they may also call the MOH hotline at 1800-333-9999.Vaccination centresTo support vaccination efforts, four COVID-19 vaccination centres will be ready in January, at Changi Airport Terminal 4, Raffles City Convention Centre, the former Hong Kah Secondary School, and Woodlands Galaxy Community Centre.More centres across the island are being planned, and there will be another four vaccination centres by the end of February. These, along with the polyclinics and selected Public Health Preparedness Clinics will ensure that all who are eligible can receive their vaccinations conveniently.Vaccination is critical to protect ourselves and our loved ones, and will enable us to return to our normal way of life as more people get vaccinated. Do get vaccinated when it is offered to you and help our seniors with getting vaccinated as well.For more details, click hereor visit vaccine.gov.sg",

This could mean a wider undetected community transmission.To reduce the risk of community transmission, safe management measures will be tightened: From 26 January 2021, there will be a cap of 8 unique visitors per household per day. The pilot for shortlisted nightclubs and karaoke outlets to resume operations will be suspended. The start of the National School Games, originally scheduled for February, will be postponed.Staying safe during the Chinese New Year periodDuring festive season, there is a higher risk of transmission as interactions in the community increase. With Chinese New Year approaching, do remember the following:When dining out, Wear a mask if you’re not eating or drinking. This means that masks must be worn during the tossing of yusheng. Avoid raising voices at all times. Lohei should be done without saying the usual auspicious phrases. There must not be multiple table bookings, unless you are from the same household. But even so, there should not be inter-mingling across tables.If you are doing house visits, Limit your visits to family and to not more than 2 households per day Otherwise, connect digitally with your family and friendsKeeping to these measures will help us avoid sparking large clusters, which may require further tightening of measures. Surveillance testing will be carried out for stallholders, shop owners, persons in the F&B industry as well as food delivery persons operating around Chinatown. This will take place from 8 to 9 February 2021, and all individuals in the identified community groups are strongly encouraged to go for testing.As we celebrate the Chinese New Year festivities, let’s remain socially responsible and remind others to do the same, so that we can keep transmission rates low in Phase 3.For more details, click here.",

          "context": "what is covid 19\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to pneumonia.This group of viruses usually infect only animals.But scientists have identified seven types of coronaviruses that affect humans.Of these seven, the more severe infections are:-Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) Singapore suffered 33 deaths due to Sars in 2003.- Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers-CoV) This was first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012- Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)The first cases were reported in December 2019 in Wuhan, the capital city of China’s Hubei province.On a Facebook post on 28 Jan, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong noted that “Experts think the Wuhan virus may be less lethal than SARS, but more infectious”.The COVID-19 has been closely linked to the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan.The market reportedly peddled live animals like snakes, deer and otters.Prof Leo Yee Sin, Executive Director of the National Centre for Infectious Diseases, answers a few key questions about COVID-19.\nHow is it transmitted?Routes of transmission have yet to be definitively determined, but human-to-human transmission is confirmed.Singaporeans are advised to remain vigilant and observe good personal hygiene practices.What are the symptoms of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)?Typical symptoms include: Fever Cough Shortness of breathThe situation is evolving and many characteristics of the virus and how it may affect people are still unclear.However, preliminary information suggests that the nCoV has the potential to cause severe disease and death, especially among the elderly and those with underlying health problems or compromised immune systems.How long is the incubation period?Data suggests that the incubation period is up to 14 days.Travellers to China are advised to monitor their health closely or at least 2 weeks upon return to Singapore.Seek medical attention promptly if you feel unwell. Inform your doctor of your travel history.What treatment options are there?Supportive treatment is provided based on the patient’s clinical condition.No specific treatment or anti-viral drug for the nCoV is currently available.Watch Minister for Health Gan Kim Yong's speech in Parliament on 6 February 2020 on the epidemiology on the 2019-nCoV:For more information on the nCoV, go to",

Even as we unwind, remember to stay vigilant and maintain the good habits we have been practicing.1. Use SafeEntry and TraceTogether (TT) when you’re out and aboutContact tracing will continue to be essential in our fight against COVID-19. SafeEntry tracks entry and exit records at venues to identify any COVID-19 clusters. Remember to “Check-in” and “Check-out” when visiting places such as markets and malls. TT – both the app and token – helps to identify people in close contact with COVID-19 cases and ringfence infections quickly. TT does not collect data about your location, but uses proximity data instead. Read more about TraceTogether here.Download the TraceTogether app on your mobile device. For those who do not own or prefer not to use a mobile phone, you can collect the token at your constituency’s Community Centres/Clubs.2. Dine-out, space-outLooking forward to catching up with friends and family over a meal outside? Ensure you and your makan kakis: Mask up once you’re done eating/drinking Keep the group small Practise safe distancing and avoid mingling between tables Avoid sharing food and utensils, use serving spoons instead3. Beat the crowds by doing Christmas shopping online Click here to assess crowd levels in malls before leaving home Use self-checkout or contactless payment when available Whenever possible, make appointments in advance, e.g. for the viewing or testing of products Follow safe management measures – keep a 1m safe distance away from others4. Keep gatherings small and cosy Planning your Christmas dinner or a New Year countdown celebration? Keep the group small and abide by group-size limits (currently, households may receive up to five visitors are any one time) Dial in: include more people in your celebration virtually Avoid hosting multiple gatherings in a day Stay masked up, except when eating or drinking If you’re ill, don’t join the gatherings – you’re risking the health of your loved ones!Continue to stay socially responsible during this holiday season – remember that the health of all depends on each one of us. From Gov.sg, we would like to wish you and your family a safe and joyful holiday!For more tips on how to stay safe, check out Gov.sg’s How-to series",

In order to do this, the safety and efficacy of the vaccines are key. Singapore has put in place stringent processes to assess the safety of the vaccines we bring in: Ensure they comply with the World Health Organization’s guidelines and international standards Health Sciences Authority (HSA) is reviewing scientific and clinical evidence in detail; and is in constant consultation with global benchmark regulatory authorities Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination is assessing how best to deploy the vaccines across all population segments to achieve optimal health outcomes for Singapore and Singaporeans\nAdvanced Purchase Agreements with pharmaceutical companiesSingapore has signed Advance Purchase Agreements with Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech and Sinovac, and are in discussions with a few other pharmaceutical companies. HSA has authorised the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for pandemic use in Singapore, and the first batch of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines is expected to arrive in Singapore by end-December 2020. Subsequent batches from the three companies will arrive in 2021.Singapore is also a strong supporter and active participant in the work of the global COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access (COVAX) Facility and has entered into a Commitment Agreement to give us the right to purchase a certain amount of vaccines. Vaccinations will be freeAll Singaporeans and long-term residents will be able to get vaccinated by end-2021.Vaccination is strongly encouraged for everyone, but it is voluntary. The vaccination will be free.\nSingapore will be progressively vaccinatedPriority for vaccination will go to those at greater risk. These include: Healthcare and frontline workers Vulnerable groups (e.g. the elderly; those at greater risk of severe disease from COVID-19 infection)Vaccination will be deferred for the following groups until more data on safety and efficacy for these groups is available: Pregnant women Those with compromised immunity Children under 16 years oldThe Expert Committee will share its detailed advice on the overall vaccination strategy for Singapore and its specific recommendations on each of the vaccines in the coming weeks.Vaccination not a silver bulletWhile comprehensive vaccination coverage in the population will enable Singapore to re-open further and expedite recovery from the pandemic, it is not a silver bullet. Singapore cannot let its guard down. Continue to be vigilant, keep up with good practices and abide by safe management measures. For more information, click here.",

All the new infections were imported and were placed on stay-home notice or isolated upon arrival in Singapore. Fourcases are permanent residents who returned from India, Indonesia and Malaysia. Two other cases - a dependant's pass holder and a work pass holder -arrived from India. Another case is a long-term visit pass holder who arrived from the UK. Six cases are work permit holders who arrived from Bangladesh, India, Indonesia and Malaysia, of whom one is a foreign domestic worker. The four remaining cases are short-term visit pass holders: Three arrived from Brazil, Canada and Serbia to participate in a sporting event; the remaining case arrived from the US with her child who is studying in Singapore. Epidemiological investigations are in progress. All the identified close contacts of the cases have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine periodso that MOHcan detect asymptomatic cases. MOH will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the cases could have been infected by them. Twelve more cases have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities, bringing Singapore's total recoveries to 60,214. There are 46 cases still in hospital. Most of them are stable or improving, and one is in critical condition in the intensive care unit. Another 205 people are being isolated and cared for at community facilities. The number of new cases in the community has remained stable at 2 cases per week in the past 2 weeks, said MOH. The number of unlinked cases in the community has also remained stable at 2 cases per week in the past 2 weeks. Of the 174confirmed COVID-19 cases reported between Mar 30andApr 5, 73 cases have tested positive for their serology tests, 83have tested negativeand 18serology test results are pending. VACCINATION FOR PEOPLE UNDER 45 YEARS OLD From June, the Government plans toinvite people under the age of 45 to book slots for their COVID-19 vaccination. Singapore continues to make “steady progress” with its vaccination programme, saidSenior Minister of State for Health Janil Puthuchearyin Parliament on Monday. He added, however, that Singapore’s supply of vaccines remains limited by the ability of vaccine manufacturers to deliver, given the high levels of global demand. “This has resulted in limited booking slots in recent days. I apologise for the inconvenience caused to those who have not been able to book earlier. As more supplies arrive, we will progressively open more slots,” he said. Responding to questions about a digital vaccine passport system,Dr Puthucheary saidmore data is needed to assess if changes to border measures can be made for people who have been vaccinated. Border measures will also have to take into consideration other factors such as the number of COVID-19 cases and infection control measures implemented in source countries, he said. \"Hence progress on cross-border recognition of vaccine certification may take some time. We will provide further updates when there is significant progress,\"Dr Puthucheary added. As of Monday, Singapore has reported a total of60,495COVID-19 cases.",

Mass runs, open-water swims, cycling and triathlon events are some examples that typically fall under this category. In an updated advisory on organising sport event pilots during Phase 3 of Singapore's COVID-19 reopening, SportSG said different sessions are to be adequately separated by time to avoid participants congregating at the venue. \"Organisers may propose the number of sessions and time interval between sessions to ensure safe participation, which may vary depending on context,\" said SportSG. Sport events with mass participation will still not be allowed to have more than 250 participants.Organisers are also not allowed to invite spectators and measures should be in place \"to prevent spontaneous gathering of onlookers for such events\", added SportSG. COMPETITIONS AND TOURNAMENTS SportSG also announced on Tuesday a second category of sport event pilots - sport competitions and tournaments without spectators.These refer to events that involve timed races or head-to-head matches where there could be multiple heats or qualifying rounds. Approved events must not exceed 50 people a session in each facility, with different sessions \"adequately separated within a day or across multiple days\" to avoid congregation. Each match is capped at eight people, including referees who need to be in the field of play.If there are multiple matches, close contact must not exceed 50 people a day for each participant. \"For example, if a team plays multiple matches a day, each team member shall not play more than 49 others (including teammates) in a day,\" said SportSG. LIVE SPECTATOR EVENTS As announced by the COVID-19 multi-ministry task force last month, sport events with live spectators are also allowed. These can have up to 750 spectators with pre-event testing implemented or up to 250 spectators without pre-testing. According to the latest guidelines, spectators are to be divided into zones of up to 50 people, but organisers can apply to do without zoning \"if they can ensure compliance with all other safe management measures\". These include having spectators remain seated and masked throughout the event, as well as mandating the use of TraceTogether for SafeEntry check-in to the venue. ORGANISERS TO APPLY 30 DAYS BEFORE EVENT \"As part of the pilot, all sport events that involve more than 50 persons (including participants, spectators, officials, event crew and support staff) will need to be endorsed by Sport Singapore before they can be implemented,\" said the agency. Organisers must submit their application at least 30 days before the start of the event \"to give time for evaluation and discussion\", said SportSG, adding that they are advised not to publicise the event before it is endorsed. This is because changes may be required, and organisers will be responsible for any additional costs incurred due to the changes or compensations to participants if the event is postponed or cancelled, SportSG said. Among the measures to reduce physical interaction, organisers are to minimise crowding at common facilities, such as registration counters, common corridors and toilets. Live spectators should also remain in their assigned seats throughout and \"refrain from talking or cheering loudly\", said the advisory.",

          "context": "12 Apr 2021 06:30AM Some cleaning firms see higher demand as more people return to the workplace, but challenges remain - CNA SINGAPORE: A day after it was announced that more employees in Singapore will be allowed back at the workplace from Apr 5, Clean Lab received an urgent request for a deep-cleaning service. “The company asked if we can do a deep clean of their office carpet immediately,” said Clean Lab’s business development manager Serene Chang. “They mentioned that their office has been left unused for a long time and dirt is building up.” That was not the only enquiry that came through, and the local cleaning and disinfection company soon found its servicesfully booked for the next two weeks. Apart from deep-cleaning and disinfection services, more companies are looking for professional help who can be stationed at their offices for regular cleaning and maintenance. “Some companies have previously engaged regular cleaners to be at their office daily but during the pandemic last year with everyone working from home, they terminated this service. Now that more people are going back to the office, companies are looking at hiring daily cleaners again,” said Ms Chang. Overall, Clean Lab saw a 20 per cent increase in demand for its services since the announcementon Mar 24, as companies try to adjust to the latest easing of COVID-19 measures to allow up to 75 per cent of employees back in the office. Another cleaning service provider Nimbus also noted a 20 per cent jump in bookings. So far, it has provided disinfection services that include spraying disinfectant mist and a thorough wipe-down of all office equipment. Moving forward, Nimbus also expects more demand for regular cleaning as companies “value hygiene and cleanliness a lot more”, said chief executive and founder of Nimbus Daniel Thong. That said, there are some cleaning service providers who have not seen an immediatereaction from their customers. Conrad Maintenance Services said most of the companies it is working with are not in a hurry to have more employees back in the office and prefer to “wait and see for another one to two months.” It is, however, not too concerned about missing out on the latest boom in demand, managing director Raymond Ng told CNA. This is because the company, like many others in the cleaning industry, has already seen a surge in the amount of work over the past year amid the coronavirus pandemic. For instance, high-touch points are to be cleaned at least twice a day, while some firms have asked for disinfection controls to be stepped up from once a month to as frequent as twice a week. Mr Ng and his employees have been clocking longer hours. He has tried offering higher wages to hire new cleaners but to no avail, as locals continue to shun the industry. “We are facing a very serious manpower problem, probably the worst since I started 18 years ago,” said Mr Ng, adding that the issue of labour shortage has been a perennial one. To cope, his company decided to focus on just industrial and commercial office cleaning five years ago. CKS General Services, which operates CleanOne, is also grappling with insufficient workers, especially as more than half of its workforce decided to return home to Malaysia since last year. “They haven’t been able to come back and with the situation uncertain, we also find it difficult to bring them back because some customers may not feel safe,” said senior sales executive Joelle Een. “So we try to hire locally. We have posted job advertisements offering S$1,800 to S$2,300 for the past six to nine months but no one wants to be a cleaner.” The company has thus far explored other options, such as participating in job fairs organised by Workforce Singapore and posting its job recruitments on other platforms such as Telegram and Facebook. The company said it intends to focus more on home cleaning as it is less manpower-intensive. It also expects this part of the business to start picking up once more people head back to the office. Others have tappedtechnology to cope. Clean Lab, for instance, uses a specialised machine to disperse its disinfection mist. “From within the keyboards to other hard-to-reach surfaces like the top of cabinets, it will ensure a very detailed disinfection and make the job more effective for our workers,” said Ms Chang.",

Hong Kong authorities announced last week that SIA flights departing from Singapore will not be allowed to land in Hong Kong from Apr3to 16, due to a COVID-19 case on flight SQ882 on Mar 31. The 28-year-old woman was a transit passenger who had travelled from Indonesia. In addition, three other transit passengers on the SIA flighthad undergone COVID-19 pre-departure tests at clinics in their places of origin that did not meet Hong Kong’s requirements. \"In short, the recent suspension of SQ (Singapore Airlines)flights to Hong Kong does not affect the talks to establish or restore the air traffic bubble that didn't get to start,\" said Mr Ong. \"Any travel bubble will not carry transit passengers,\" he added. \"Travel bubble operates on the basis that the flightstravelling within the bubble carry only what we call 'OD' -origin-destination passengers.So actually transit passengers are out outside of the bubble, so it wouldn't affect. And we continue to workwithHong Kong to restore this travel bubble.\" The Transport Minister was responding to a supplementary question from Member of Parliament Ang Wei Neng (PAP-West Coast), who asked whether Hong Kong's decision to suspend SIA flightswould impact plans for a travel bubble. Mr Ong said that Hong Kong's civil aviation authorities haveset in place\"very transparent criteria\" forairlines. He noted that a combination of \"technical breaches\" had resulted in SIA's temporary suspension. \"Once you breach some of the criteria, you get suspended for 14 days so they have suspended (airlines for)23 times before this latest incident where SQ got suspended for two weeks,\" Mr Ong said. \"The Hong Kong aviation authorities enforce thisvery strictly, so it triggered the suspension,\" he added. Singapore and Hong Kong were scheduled to launch an air travel bubble in November last year but it was deferred after Hong Kong saw a surge in COVID-19 cases. On Nov 21, a day before flights were to begin, it was announced that the launch of the travel bubble hadbeendeferred to early December. It was laterpushed back to 2021, with the exact starting date yet to be determined. On Mar 29, Mr Ong said Singapore is studying a proposal from Hong Kong to reopen borders safely,a Hong Kong official said it has resumed discussions on a travel bubble with Singapore.",

          "context": "08 Apr 2021 09:05PM Upcoming trade show at MBS to see 2,500 participants, Singapore’s biggest since start of COVID-19  - CNA SINGAPORE: An upcoming trade show at the Marina Bay Sands (MBS) is set to welcome 2,500 participants, making it the biggest of such large-scale business events to be held in Singapore since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Set to take place from Jun 30 to Jul 2, the Architecture and Building Services 2021 is also expecting 5,000 virtual attendees as it takes on a hybrid format, its organiser Conference & Exhibition Management Services (CEMS) announced on Thursday (Apr 8). “The physical and on-site aspects of the show are critical in terms of acquiring and forging business agreements, and for cementing important business decisions. At the same time, our virtual event would help our Singapore companies to globalise and reach new markets throughout the world,” said CEMS managing director Edward Liu. SAFETY MEASURES The organiser said it plans to split the 11,620 sq m exhibition space into four zones. Each zone will have no more than 50 participants at a time in accordance with prevailing COVID-19 safety measures. It will also implement two-hour time slots from 10am to 6pm for the admission of participants into the venue throughout the three days. After the end of every two hours, participants will be ushered out before a new batch can enter. Safe-distancing ambassadors will be on site to ensure these rules are kept to. Registration and pre-event COVID-19 testing will be conducted at an adjacent exhibition hall, CEMS said. According to the latest guidelines announced last month, pre-event testing is required for events of more than 250 people. But individuals who have completed the full vaccination regimen and have had time to develop sufficient protection from the viruswill be exempted. The Architecture and Building Services 2021 event will be “among the first few pilot trade shows with a substantially vaccinated attendee population,” said Mr Andrew Phua, executive director of exhibitions and conferences at the Singapore Tourism Board (STB). “This gives us the opportunity to roll out and refine newly-developed protocols such as exempting all vaccinated local attendees from pre-event testing requirements at larger-scale events.” Meanwhile, to provide an “additional layer of screening”, robots will be stationed at the entrances of the venue to conduct temperature scanning, said Mr Liu. These robots, owned by local firm Concorde Security, can scan up to three people at one go and will help to reduce the manpower needed. About 50 of these robots are already being used by various retail and food and beverage outlets, said the security firm’s executive director Alan Chua. Asked if it will be considering technology that was trialled at previous trade shows, CEMS said it is in discussions with two local technology firms on the use of a Bluetooth-enabled dongle. This pocket-size dongle, which tracks users’ information such as location, distance and interaction time, was deployed at GEO Connect Asia 2021, a trade show held last month at the MBS. REVIVING MICE SECTOR Singapore has been taking steps to revive its multi-billion dollar meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions (MICE) industryas it gears up to host the World Economic Forum in August. Since the announcement of STB’s safe business events framework in July last year, about 60 MICE events hosting close to 9,000 attendees have been held, said Mr Phua. Notably, there were two large-scale hybrid trade shows – the TravelRevive in November last year and the more recent GEO Connect Asia 2021, which saw about 1,000 participants each. The upcoming Architecture and Building Services 2021 will be the third of such mega business events, which Mr Liu from CEMS said are “critical steps” for his industry to embark on a recovery. “The piloting of our show will allow STB and the industry to further calibrate safety protocols and test new formats and processes, in preparation of larger MICE events in the near future,” he added. “Obviously we want to regain the premium position that Singapore occupies in this part of the world.” STB’s Mr Phua said through these trade shows, “Singapore is challenging the assumption that larger MICE events cannot be held safely”. “We are progressively resuming such events, with rigorous protocols and innovative solutions for the end-to-end visitor journey,” he added, noting that the tourism board will continue to support the sector in building new capabilities and reimagine MICE events for a post-pandemic world. The MICE sector is a key player in Singapore’s tourism industry. Prior to the pandemic, it contributed S$3.8 billion in value-add to the economy, or nearly one per cent of gross domestic product, and supported more than 34,000 jobs.",

Passengers will be able to share their pre-departure COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test results with their airline during check-in and on-arrival at the immigration checkpoints at Changi Airport, said CAAS and IATA on Monday (Apr 5). \"This is part of an ongoing collaboration between CAASand IATA to facilitate seamless and efficient travel through digital certificates of COVID-19 tests,\" they said. The IATA travel pass is a mobile appthat can be used by passengers to obtain and store their COVID-19 test results from accredited laboratories. Last month, Singapore Airlines (SIA) tested IATA's travel pass on passengers travelling from Singapore to London between Mar 15 and Mar 28. The airline said the app was well received by their customers and noted that they were open to using the app for international travel in the future. Following SIA's trials, CAAS and IATA said Singapore's health and border control authorities will accept the travel pass as a valid form of presentation of COVID-19 pre-departure tests for entry into the country. \"The information presented on the IATA travel pass will be in a format that satisfies Singapore’s prevailing COVID-19 pre-departure test requirements for entry into Singapore,\" said the authorities, adding that they will be working on further enhancements to the travel pass. This includes enabling QR code scanning by immigration officers. Back-end transmission of health credentials from the travel pass to the airlines and immigration authorities' systems for pre-boarding and pre-arrival clearance will be included, as well as including digital vaccination certificates on the travel pass. CAAS director-general Kevin Shum said the collaboration with IATA demonstrates the \"shared commitment to drive the adoption of digital health certificates and restore international air travel\". \"As we work to safely rebuild the Changi air hub, we will continue to explore other solutions that can provide similarly secure and verifiable means of sharing health certificates for safe international travel,\" said Mr Shum. The travel pass will be available for download in the second half of April and is currently being trialled by more than 20 airlines, including SIA. Those who are travelling to Singapore and intend to use the travel pass should check with the airline they are travelling with for eligibility to use the travel pass, said CAAS and IATA. CHANGI AIRPORT LAUNCHES NEW ONLINE CONCIERGE SERVICE FOR TRAVELLERS On Monday, Changi Airport Group (CAG) launched a new online concierge service for travellers planning to travel to Singapore by air. The new Safe Travel Concierge service lets passengers book their on-arrival COVID-19 PCR test and check that they have completed all pre-travel requirements for entry into Singapore, said CAG. \"Instead of searching different websites to apply for their pre-travel documents, passengers can easily access the information and forms through STC,\" it said. Passengers can simply add their upcoming trips after registering for aSafe Travel Conciergeaccount. Depending on their profile and trip details, they will be shown a customised list of pre-travel requirements to complete before flying to Singapore. Besides booking their on-arrival PCR tests, they can also access services such as the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority's electronic arrival card and health declaration form through the online concierge. Registration for an account is free and passengers can register for one on safetravel.changiairport.com.",

          "context": "08 Apr 2021 06:01PM PM Lee thanks DPM Heng Swee Keat for 'selfless decision' to step aside as leader of 4G team - CNA SINGAPORE: Singapore’s Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Thursday (Apr 8) thanked Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat for his “selfless decision” to step aside as leader of the country’s fourth generation of ministers. This came after Mr Heng’s letter to Mr Lee announcing his intention to stand down as leader of the 4G team, to allow a younger leader to take over. Noting the demands of the post-COVID-19 world, Mr Heng said: “While I am in good health today, it is in the best interests of the nation, for someone who is younger to tackle the huge challenges ahead.” Mr Heng has been an \"important member\" of his team for the last 10 years, said Mr Lee during a press conference on Thursday. Mr Lee, Mr Heng and other 4G ministers including Education Minister Lawrence Wong, HealthMinister Gan Kim Yong, Transport Minister Ong Ye Kung,and Trade and Industry Minister Chan ChunSing were in attendance. In his letter to Mr Heng, Mr Lee said that he understood and respected Mr Heng’s decision.While Mr Heng will continue to stay on as deputy prime minister and coordinating minister for economic policies, he will relinquish his finance portfolio at the next Cabinet reshuffle, as earlier planned, said Mr Lee. In addition, Mr Heng will continue to chair the Joint Committee on Bilateral Cooperation with China and lead the Singapore Together movement, said Mr Lee.  Mr Heng will also stay on asfirst assistant secretary-general of the People's Action Party (PAP). “You have done exceptional work as Minister for Finance, especially during the past year in the trying circumstances wrought by the COVID-19 pandemic,” wrote Mr Lee. “Within twelve months, you delivered an unprecedented five Budgets that supported Singaporeans and their families, helped businesses to survive and kept everyone safe. Indeed, in the five years you have been Finance Minister, you have delivered a record ten budgets.” Mr Lee acknowledged the “difficult job” that Mr Heng had taken on when he took the position of finance minister in 2015. “Even before COVID-19 hit, Singapore had reached a crossroads. We had to overcome fiscal challenges while strengthening social safety nets, as well as transform our economy in the face of seismic global disruptions.” Mr Lee said that Mr Heng did not hesitate to take up the challenge and put “heart and soul” into the task, adding that Mr Heng’s work with the Committee on the Future Economy and the Future Economy Council had helped workers master new skills and capabilities and “build new industries and sectors for the future”. He added that he looked forward to Mr Heng carrying on this work as coordinating minister for economic policies. “This dovetails with your role as Chairman of the National Research Foundation, where under your guidance we are making steady progress developing research, innovation and enterprise.” Mr Heng and the Prime Minister had discussed Mr Heng's relinquishment of the finance portfoliolast year, when working out Cabinet appointments following the general election, said Mr Lee during the press conference. \"We agreed that Budget 2021 would be an important budget, not anemergency budget like the five in 2020, but the budget to take Singapore beyond COVID-19,\" he said. \"I told him it would be good for them to see through Budget 2021, and then he wouldgive up the MOF (Ministry of Finance) portfolio to concentrate on the broader coordinating responsibilities.\"  There will be consequential moves in other ministries, and he will announce the reshuffle in about two weeks, Mr Lee said. MR HENG WILL MENTOR THE YOUNGER MINISTERS Mr Lee also noted in his letterMr Heng’s five years at the education ministry, before he took on the position of finance minister. “There, your inclusive vision of excellence in every school inspired educators and students alike,” he said.  Mr Heng had proposed to raise government-funded university education to 40 per cent of each cohort, which paved the way to create two new universities, said Mr Lee. They are the Singapore Institute of Technology and the Singapore University of Social Sciences. Mr Lee also noted how Mr Heng had widened the definition of success, which led to the national SkillsFuture programme, and placed emphasis on developing the character and values of the young. “The result is an education system that not only prepares our young to access good jobs, but also nurtures upright, public-spirited citizens,” he said. Mr Heng’s stepping aside as 4G leader is “fully in keeping with the spirit of public service and sense of duty” that motivated him to step forward when asked to run for election in 2011, the Prime Minister said. “Together with the Senior Ministers, you will help me mentor the younger Ministers as the team develop and identify from among themselves another leader, in order to make a smooth and timely leadership transition. “By working closely together, we will steer Singapore safely through this health and economic crisis, and secure our future for many years to come.” Citing the 4G team's statement that this is a \"significant setback\" to succession plans, Mr Lee said during the press conference that he had agreed to stay on until a new leader is chosen and ready to take over. \"I think it will take longer than a few months, but I hope that (the 4G leaders will)reach a consensus and identify a new leader before the next general elections. I have no intention of staying on longer than necessary,\" he said.",

          "context": "08 Apr 2021 06:00PM DPM Heng Swee Keat steps aside as leader of PAP 4G team, PM Lee accepts decision - CNA SINGAPORE: Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat will step aside as the leader of the fourth-generation People's Action Party (PAP) leadership team, he announced on Thursday (Apr 8). \"This year, I am 60,\" said Mr Heng, adding that he would be in his mid-60s when the COVID-19 crisis is over. \"When I also consider the ages at which our first three Prime Ministers have taken on the job, I would have too short a runway should I become the next Prime Minister then,\" he said at a press conference announcing his decision. \"We need a leader who will not only rebuild Singapore post-COVID-19, but also lead the next phase of our nation-building efforts.\" Mr Heng said: \"After careful deliberation and discussions with my family, I have decided to step aside as leader of the 4G (fourth-generation) team, so that a younger leader who will have a longer runway can take over.\" With Mr Lee and other senior ministers, he will continue to mentor the younger ministers and identify another leader from among them, he added. Mr Heng will remain as Deputy Prime Minister and Coordinating Minister for Economic Policies, but will step down as Minister of Finance at the next Cabinet reshuffle, which will take place in about two weeks.  Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said he understands and respects Mr Heng's decision. Both had discussed and agreed that Mr Heng will relinquish his finance portfolio. \"We agreed that Budget 2021 would be an important budget, not an emergency budget like the five in 2020. But a budget to take Singapore beyond COVID-19,\" said Mr Lee. \"I told him it would be good for him to see through Budget 2021 and then he would give up the MOF portfolio to concentrate on the broader coordinating responsibilities. There will be consequential moves in other ministries, and I intend to announce the reshuffle in about two weeks' time.\" Mr Lee also noted Mr Heng's \"many contributions\" during his time as theEducation Minister and as the Finance Minister, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. \"When I asked you to take on the finance portfolio in 2015, we both knew that you had a difficult job. Even before COVID-19 hit, Singapore had reached a crossroads. We had to overcome fiscal challenges while strengthening social safety nets, as well as transform our economy in the face of seismic global disruptions,\" Mr Lee wrote in his letter of response.   \"I thank you for your selfless decision to stand aside. Your actions now are fully in keeping with the spirit of public service and sense of duty that motivated you to step forward when I asked you to stand for election in 2011.\" \"Having worked with PM, ESM (Emeritus Senior Minister) and MM (Minister Mentor), I know that the top job imposes exceptional demands on the office holder,\" said Mr Heng.\"It is in a very different post-COVID-19 world, that the demands will be even more exacting. While I am in good health today, it is in the best interests of the nation, for someone who is younger to tackle the huge challenges ahead.\" In response to Mr Heng's decision, the PAP 4G team said it has requested that Mr Lee stay on as Prime Minister until a new successor is chosen by the team and is ready to take over. \"Tackling Singapore's pressing immediate challenges and ensuring that Singapore emerges stronger from this crisis remains our foremost priority. Under these circumstances, the 4G team will need more time to select another leader from amongst us,\" they said in a joint statement. \"This unexpected turn of events is a setback for our succession planning. We recognise that Singaporeans will be concerned. We seek your support and understanding, as we choose another leader for the team.\" On whether the results of the General Election influenced his decision, Mr Heng said: \"The results of the GE2020 performance, in particular in East Coast GRC, is not the reason why I decided to step aside.\" Adding that he was the representative for Tampines for 10 years before moving to East Coast because it \"needed reinforcement\", he said: \"I did my best together with my team. When I went during the campaign period, there were residents who told me that they changed their mind, vote for the PAP, since I was there. \"That is not for me to judge, it is for others to judge. My decision is, as I have emphasised, I am 60 this year, and the COVID situation has disrupted all our plans.\" Responding to a question on when the next leader of the 4G team will be chosen, Mr Lee said succession is a \"very, very important and urgent issue\". \"Choosing a leader isn't just ranking the people and saying who's going to be the best choice.It's also really about team building and developing the team, and developing the relationships amongst the team members so that over time, from that balance and that chemistry, you are able to identify who amongst the people can most maximise the performance of the team and make all the pieces fit together and add up to more than the sum of its parts.\" This process \"takes more than a few months\", but it \"should not take more than a couple of years\", said Mr Lee. The Prime Minister said he hopes there will be a \"clear outcome\" before the next General Election. Onwho will be the Acting Prime Minister in his absence, Mr Lee said it will be Senior Ministerand Coordinating Minister for National Security Teo Chee Hean. \"Now that DPM Heng has stood aside as leader of the 4G, I am reverting to the previous arrangement, and will in future appoint SM Teo Chee Hean as Acting PM in my absence,\" said Mr Lee in response to media queries. \"This is the interim arrangement until such time as the 4G chooses a new leader from among themselves.” Mr Lee was 52, Emeritus Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong was 49 and founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew was in his 30s when they became Prime Minister. Both Mr Lee Kuan Yew and Mr Goh stepped down before they turned 70. In 2012, Prime MinisterLeeHsien Loong said he planned to step down by the age of 70 in 2022. The 4G leaders, or younger political office holders, chose Mr Heng as their leader –\"first among equals\" - by early 2018. Mr Heng was appointed Deputy Prime Minister in May 2019. He was appointed Coordinating Minister for Economic Policies at the Cabinet reshuffle after the 2020 General Election. At the time, Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan said the PAP'S 4G team was in \"complete unity\" behind Mr Heng's leadership. Amid the COVID-19 crisis, Mr Lee said in July last year that he would see Singapore through the crisis before handing over the reins to the next generation of leaders. \"You have my word: Together with my older colleagues like Teo Chee Hean and Tharman Shanmugaratnam, as well as our younger fourth-generation ministers, I will see this through. I am determined to hand over Singapore, intact and in good working order, to the next team,\" he said during an online PAP rally for the General Election.",

          "context": "07 Apr 2021 05:53PM Football: Up to 250 fans allowed to attend Singapore Premier League games starting this weekend - CNA SINGAPORE: Starting this weekend, up to 250 fans will be allowed into stadiums to watch Singapore Premier League games, said the Football Association of Singapore (FAS) on Wednesday (Apr 7). “Following discussions with the relevant regulatory agencies, a maximum of 250 fans will be admitted inside match venues from 10 April,” said FAS. The movewill begin with game week six of the league, which will be held this Saturday and Sunday. To gain entry at any match venue, fans will have to produce proof of a negative test result – either of a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test or antigen rapid test (ART) or the certification of having received the full two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine, said FAS. \"The PCR test is required to be taken within the last 14 days from the date of the match, while the ART must be taken within 24 hrs prior to end of the event,\" added FAS.\"Individuals who have been vaccinated will only be admitted if the date of the match falls at least 14 days after their second dose.\" Eligible fans who produce the required proof can then obtain a wrist tag at a dedicated booth at each match venue, which will begin operations two hours prior to kick-off. The wrist tag will be unique to the match it admits entry for and will allow the fan access to the venue 60 minutes before kick-off. The “conditional” re-entry of 250 people per match venue will be in place for match-days until Apr 23, added FAS. Following this, from Apr 24 onwards, up to 250 fans will be allowed to enter match venues without the need for any testing, said FAS. This follows new guidelines announced by the COVID-19 multi-ministry task force on Mar 24. FREE ENTRY TO MATCHES UNTIL APR 23 “We have seen our SPL fans passionately supporting their clubs from various locations outside match venues since the new season kicked off on 13 March and we feel it is only right we work towards welcoming them back to matches sooner than 24 April,” said FAS General Secretary Yazeen Buhari. “I speak for the SPL clubs and players that the fans’ presence will be a welcome boost to the match-day experience. As we understand that some of them may choose to take the PCR test or the ART in order to gain entry, we have waived the cost of match tickets during this period. \"Of course, it is imperative that the fans adhere strictly to all the necessary measures to ensure the safety of themselves and others present.” The current season of the SPL began behind closed doors last month, with only eight teams competing. Brunei DPMM, who were league champions two seasons ago, had withdrawn from this year's edition of the league due to COVID-19 travel restrictions. The previous season, which was suspended in mid-March due to the COVID-19 pandemic and restarted in mid-October, also saw DPMM sit out due to similar issues. The domestic season will run until October, with more than90 matches scheduled to be played.This includes the 2021 Singapore Cup, which is slated to commence in September. Albirex were crowned SPL champions just four months ago, making itthe sixth consecutive season that a foreign team has won the league. The SPL is into its third season since it was renamed from the S League. Defending champions Albirex currently sit atop the table with ten points from a possible 12, with Hougang United one point behind in second.",

The case involves a 71-year-old Indian national who is a short-term visit pass holder, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said in its daily update. Herinfectionis currently unlinked. The woman is a retiree who arrived from India on Dec 28, 2020. She served her stay-home notice at a dedicated facility until Jan 10,andtested negative for COVID-19 on Jan 8. As the womanwas identified as a close contact of two previously confirmed cases - known as Cases 59169 and 59173 -during their flight to Singapore, she was placed on quarantine from Jan 10 to Jan 11. She developed a fever on Apr 5 and was tested for COVID-19 when she sought medical treatment the next day, said MOH. Her test result came back positive for COVID-19 infection on Apr 8 and she was conveyed in an ambulance to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases. Another COVID-19 test conducted by the National Public Health Laboratory on Apr 9 came back negative. The woman's serological test result has come back positive, which is indicative of a past infection, said MOH. \"She could be shedding minute fragments of the virus RNA, which are no longer transmissible and infective to others, but given that we are not able to definitively conclude when she had been infected, we will take all the necessary public health actions as a precautionary measure,\" said the ministry. IMPORTED CASES The remaining 31 cases were imported infections and were placed on stay-home notice upon arrival in Singapore. One is a Singaporean who returned from Papua New Guinea. Two cases are short-term visit pass holders. One of them arrived from India with her spouse who is working here. Another case arrived from Malaysia to visit a family member who is a permanent resident. Two dependant's pass holders and five student's pass holderswho arrived from India are also among the imported cases. Three cases are long-term visit pass holders who arrived from India and Myanmar. Another three are work pass holders whoarrived from Nepal, the Maldives and the Philippines. The remaining 15 are work permit holders who arrived fromBangladesh, India, Indonesia, Myanmar and the Philippines, of whom five are foreign domestic workers. No new infections were reported in migrant worker dormitories. EIGHTEEN CASES DISCHARGED Eighteen more cases have been discharged, bringing the total who have fully recovered from the infection to 60,322. There are 45 cases remaining in hospital, with one in critical condition in the intensive care unit. Another 236 cases areisolated and cared for at community facilities. Overall, the number of new cases in the community has remained stable at two cases per week in the past twoweeks. The number of unlinked cases in the community has also remained stable at two cases per week in the past two weeks. \"We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance programme,\" said MOH. Epidemiological investigations are in progress for the cases. In the meantime, all their identified close contacts have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. \"We will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the cases could have been infected by them,\" said the ministry. As of Saturday, Singapore reported 60,633 COVID-19 cases in total,with 30 fatalities. LUCKY PLAZA, PENINSULA PLAZA WEEKEND RESTRICTIONS TO BE LIFTED Weekend entry restrictionsat Lucky Plaza and Peninsula Plaza will be lifted fromSaturday, more than sevenmonths after they were put in place as part of COVID-19 measures. Improvements in the crowding situationhave been observedat the two malls, the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) and Enterprise Singapore (ESG) said on Friday. “While entry restrictions have been lifted, visitors are strongly advised not to rush to these malls immediately, or to visit during peak hours,” STB and ESG said in a joint release. “To avoid a longer waiting time to enter the malls, patrons should plan their visits during weekdays or non-peak periods on weekends.” Odd-even entry restrictions based on the last digit of the identification number for each visitor have been in place at the malls since Aug 29 last year.",

They found that the chemotherapeutic drug, called Topotecan, reduced the severity and death rates of infection by the virus that causes COVID-19,bysuppressing inflammation in the lungs oflaboratory animals. This has potential implicationsfor COVID-19 treatment in humans, said the National University Cancer Institute, Singapore (NCIS) on Wednesday (Apr 7). The findings by researchers from NCISand the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in the United States werepublished online in the scientific journal Cell in March. The safety and efficacy of the treatmentin humans will soon be evaluated at clinical sites around the world, said NCIS, adding that its team has secured a research grant to conduct a Phase 1 clinical trial of Topotecan in COVID-19 patients. The research is supported by the Singapore Ministry of Health’s National Medical Research Council and the National Research Foundation under the COVID-19 Research Fund, NCISadded. Co-author of the study, Dr Anand Jeyasekharan,said that a “key finding” from the study is that the cancer drug is able to suppress inflammation induced by the COVID-19 virus at a dose lower than typically used in cancer treatment. “Topotecan has been used in oncology for over 25 years, with a well-understood safety profile in humans, and importantly is both inexpensive and globally available. \"This research is therefore timely given the lack of universal access to vaccines,” saidDr Jeyasekharan, consultant and assistant director of research (Medical Oncology) at the Department of Haematology-Oncology at NCIS. Scientists have observed that the virus triggers excess production of chemicals that are normally secreted by cells of the immune system to help fight infection, NCISsaid. “In some patients, an exaggerated immune system response, which characteristically occurs in the lungs, can flood the infected area with white blood cells, resulting in severe inflammation, tissue damage and often death,” a spokesperson said, “Reduction of the inflammatory state in such patients could therefore improve their clinical outcomes.” FINDING A SOLUTION TO INFLAMMATION Associate Professor Ivan Marazzi of the Microbiology Department at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinaisaid that so far, in pre-clinical models of COVID-19, there are no therapies shown to reduce SARS-CoV-2 inflammation when administered after more than one day post-infection. “This is a huge problem because people who have moderate or severe COVID-19 often do not present to hospitals until many days after infection,” he said. The cancer drug was however found to be able to limit the “hyper-inflammation” in the lungs of infected animals even days after the infection, he added. The current study, which also has contributions from partners in Hong Kong, the United Kingdomand other global sites, expands on a 2016 research paper by Dr Marazzi’s team, which was also published in a journal. The earlier research found that inhibiting the activation of inflammatory genes by the cancer drug could help prevent animal deaths from viral and bacterial infections, and suggested this could be a potent strategy against future pandemics, NCISsaid. Dr Jeyasekharan said that repurposing of existing drugs represents a valuable global strategy for treating COVID-19. However, only a few that show pre-clinical promise have gone on to be efficacious in patients, he said. “Topotecan is an attractive candidate given that it is safe and inexpensive with generic formulations existing throughout the world,” he added.",

          "context": "08 Apr 2021 06:00PM DPM Heng says he is stepping aside as 4G leader for younger person to become future PM - CNA SINGAPORE: Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat said he is stepping aside as leader of the 4G team for someone younger with a “longer runway” to become the next Prime Minister. He informed Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong of his decision in a letter on Thursday (Apr 8), saying it was made after “careful deliberation and discussion” with his family. Mr Lee has accepted his decision. He has agreed to stay on as Deputy Prime Ministerand Coordinating Minister for Economic Policies, but will step down as Finance Minister at the next Cabinet reshuffle in two weeks, Mr Lee said. Mr Heng turns 60 in November. He was appointed the People's Action Party’s (PAP) first assistant secretary-general in November 2018, a position that indicates he is the frontrunner to be Singapore's next Prime Minister. “I have decided to step aside as leader of the 4G team, so that a younger leader who will have a longer runway can take over,” he wrote in the letter to Mr Lee. “While I am in good health today, it is in the best interests of the nation, for someone who is younger to tackle the huge challenges ahead.” Citing the prolonged COVID-19 pandemic, Mr Heng said he would be close to the mid-60s when the crisis is over. “The 60s are still a very productive time of life. But when I also consider the ages at which our first three Prime Ministers took on the job, I would have too short a runway should I become the next Prime Minister then,” he added. “We need a leader who will not only rebuild Singapore post-COVID-19, but also lead the next phase of our nation-building effort.” Mr Lee became Prime Minister in 2004 when he was 52 years old, while former Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong assumed the position in 1990 when he was 49. Singapore’s first Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew was 35 years old when he took office. Mr Heng said the next Prime Minister should have a “sufficiently long runway” to master the demands of leading Singapore, formulate and see through longer-term strategies for the country, and win the confidence and support of Singaporeans to build a shared future together. “This long-term orientation of successive PAP governments and the support of our people have been critical to Singapore’s success,” he said in the letter. Having worked with Mr Lee as well as the two former Prime Ministers, Mr Heng said he knows that the “top job imposes exceptional demands on the office holder”. “In a very different post-COVID-19 world, the demands will be even more exacting,” he added. Mr Hengnoted that when he had a stroke in 2016, his Cabinet colleagues were \"unstinting\" in their support. \"With the great work of my medical team, and the care and encouragement of my family, friends and fellow Singaporeans, I was able to recover fully,\" he wrote. Mr Heng said the 4G team’s top priority is to deal with the immediate crisis and keep the people of Singapore safe, as he thanked Mr Lee for his commitment to stay on as Prime Minister until the crisis is over. It will be for the 4G team to choose its next leader, he said, adding that he stands ready to support thatperson. During a press conference in July last year, following the most recent Cabinet reshuffle, a question was posed on whether the 4G ministers had discussed or reviewed the backing of Mr Heng as their leader. Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing, who is also the PAP's second assistant secretary-general, responded that the team was entirely focused on saving jobs and helping Singapore overcome economic challenges during the pandemic, with \"no plans\" to do otherwise. Foreign Affairs Minister Vivian Balakrishnan then said a day later that the 4G leaders were in \"complete unity\" behind the leadership of Mr Heng.  GE2020 RESULTS NOT A FACTOR IN DECISION: DPM HENG At a press conference on Thursday, Mr Heng said that he started thinking about the issue of succession when he was appointed 4G leader in 2018. \"I do not want to take on any job which I cannot deliver,\" he said, noting that the pandemic was a \"real turning point\". \"As those of you who have worked with me know, I am a workaholic and I put my heart and soul into what I do. And therefore, I've been thinking about it as to whether am I the right person?\"  Mr Heng also said that his team's performance in the 2020 General Election, when he helmed the PAP team in East Coast GRC, was not the reason why he was stepping aside. The PAP held off a challenge by the Workers' Party, winning 53.41 per cent of the vote. \"I have been an MP in Tampines for 10 years and worked very well with the team and built certain rapport with residents,\" Mr Hengsaid. \"But when East Coast needed reinforcement, I decided to go. It is a completely new ground for me and I did my best together with my team. \"When I went during the campaign period, there were residents who told me that they changed their mind to vote for the PAP since I was there, so that is not for me to judge. It's for others to judge.\" When asked if he will run in the next General Election, Mr Heng said he will \"continually fight to retain\" East Coast GRC, as he thanked residents there for giving their mandate. \"My team and I remain as committed as before to serving them,\" he said. \"The PAP has never taken the support of Singaporeans for granted. And I will continue to serve Singaporeans to the best of my ability, in ways which are useful and meaningful.\" Mr Heng said in hisletter to the Prime Minister that he appreciatesthe support of Singaporeans and has made hisdecision\"with the best interests of Singapore and Singaporeans at heart\". “I will continue my best, to support you, Cabinet colleagues and the party, so that we can continue to improve the lives of Singaporeans and emerge stronger post-COVID-19.”",

          "context": "11 Apr 2021 06:00AM Commentary: Connecting Singapore and Malaysia without an HSR challenging but alternatives should be explored - CNA Resuming daily travel is the focus, but both countries should also explore digital connectivity and clean energy for landmark projects, says Stewart Nixon. SINGAPORE: With the matter of compensation finalised and the S$103 million settlement paid, the latest chapter in longstanding attempts to connect Kuala Lumpur and Singapore with high-speed rail (HSR) has concluded. The joint statement issued in end-March was short and sweet, reasserting the amicable agreement of terms and the continued commitment of both countries to advancing future cooperation. Missing were tangible alternative measures to fill the void left by the HSR, with Malaysians and Singaporeans alike left to lament the unfulfilled potential of enhanced people and business connectivity. \"The HSR would have cut that travelling time by at least five hours. It's a shame that it did not (materialise),\" 29-year old F&B manager Nurlina Anuar, who works in Singapore and whose family lives in Klang, lamented to the New Straits Times. With bilateral relations enjoying a strong and cordial phase, and a confluence of shared challenges further engendering cooperation, opportunities to deepen connectivity should not be lost with the HSR termination. VACCINE BILATERALISM The already significant integration of the Malaysian and Singaporean economies has made maintaining and restoring cross-border goods movements a top priority, with Singapore vaccinating selected cargo drivers from Malaysia to minimise the risk of imported infections. Resuming freer people movements for work, business, family visits and more is equally critical but more complex, with vaccine certification under the spotlight as a potential facilitator.   Globally, national development of vaccine certification and multilateral recognition havefailed to match the extraordinary achievements of vaccine developers and manufacturers. Bilateral discussions are comparatively advanced, with hopes for an early resumption of people movements delivering enormous benefits to Malaysia-Singapore connectivity. As Malaysia and Singapore consider bilateral vaccine certification, they must be mindful of global norms – including recent WHO guidance – highlighting the protection of privacy, equity, accessibility and sustainability as key design principles. After all, requiring proof of vaccination for travel may entrench an inequitable barrier, promote vaccine nationalism and encourage informal markets that undermine the primary objective of vaccinating for global herd immunity. Of more immediate benefit would be if vaccine certification prompts greater integration of pandemic response efforts, such as collaboration on public health mechanisms, frontline worker exchanges and support with vaccine rollout. Singapore and Malaysia are pursuing national vaccine rollouts with greatly different timeframes, presenting an immediate challenge to certificate enabled travel. Singapore has a small and clustered population that may be among the earliest fully vaccinated, whereas Malaysia has a larger, more geographically spread and significantly undocumented population that represents a much greater logistical challenge. With the largest bilateral gains conditional on both countries completing their rollouts, there are strong mutual incentives to collaborate towards accelerating Malaysia’s rollout. The Johor state government recognises this and has announced a special vaccination app for Malaysians who commute to Singapore, hoping to separately register this group with a view to fast-trackedvaccination enabling freer travel. PREFERENTIAL PEOPLE MOVEMENT Vaccine certification (and even vaccination) is not a silver bullet but a mechanism complementing public health measures. Nuanced measures have been deployed effectively within countries to refrain from arbitrarily restricting movement, yet blunter instruments persist for many international borders. Cooperation on people movements between Malaysia and Singapore is as coordinated as it has ever been due to pandemic necessity. However, for the estimated 300,000 Malaysians who used to commute to Singapore each day prior to the coronavirus, arrangements remain far from ideal. Employers, employees and families today have had to settle for Periodic Commuting Arrangements requiring a three-month stay at their destination of work. Green lanes for business travellers were periodically open but closed as virus cases in Malaysia surged.   There has been ample time to develop and agree on alternative approaches that increase travel frequency while minimising acceptable risk. Whether this involves additional testing, additional protective equipment, monitoring arrangements, movement restrictions within countries or people bubbles, both sides should continue to explore options for those willing to sacrifice certain freedoms to remain mobile. Developing such arrangements requires understanding the circumstances of frequent migrants and the businesses now short on workers as a result of border restrictions. Opportunities to address gaps and encourage the transfer of skills and investment across the border should be explored. Such discussions should provide a forum for discussing preferential longer-term arrangements for migrant settlement and integration between the two countries. (Listen to Malaysiansshare their very different experiences of living through the pandemic inJohor, Kuala Lumpur and Sabah on CNA's Heart of the Matter podcast:)  DIGITAL CONNECTIVITY AS THE VIRTUAL HIGH-SPEED RAIL ALTERNATIVE The unprecedented travel disruptions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic have emphasised the imperative of increased digital connectivity. Bilateral visitor arrivals plummeted by 16.6 million persons or 90.7 per cent in 2020, and while expenditure related to physical mobility is difficult to substitute, around a quarter of visitor expenditure ordinarily goes to shopping and travel constraints have freed up disposable income ordinarily earmarked for holidays. The challenge is to attract more consumers by bringing shopping to them, with complementary efforts to improve delivery logistics. Singapore is well-positioned in terms of infrastructure, as a global leader in fixed broadband speeds and regional leader in logistics performance. Malaysia aims to bridge the gap with its recently announced RM21 billion (S$6.8 billion) Digital Economy Blueprint, while Singaporean ride-share operator Grab has injected much needed competition into Malaysia’s delivery sector. Singaporean online platforms have been major beneficiaries of surging online sales in 2020, with Shopee and Lazada the two largest e-commerce providers in Malaysia and among the top three at home. Malaysian platforms however have comparatively little penetration of the Singaporean market. Thus far, Chinese companies have been the major beneficiaries of surging online sales, with China the market leader for e-commerce in both countries.   Since revenue from Singapore shoppers in Malaysia has declined sharply due to COVID-19, more effort must be made to translate these transactions onto an online platform. For instance, Singapore shoppers who have been starved from their regular shopping trips to JB would relish buying their necessities through an online mall, with seamless delivery. Malaysian shopping expenditure in Singapore in 2019 is at an estimated S$176 million, compared to about S$2.7 billion for Singaporean shopping in Malaysia. Bilateral efforts to harmonise digital regulations could also play an important facilitating role. Singapore has declared its intent to pursue arrangements with Japan, Australia and New Zealand among others, and there should be little impediment to progressing similar with Malaysia. CLEAN ENERGY AS ICONIC BILATERAL PROJECT The preceding measures focus on bilateral cooperation that would be both mutually beneficial and affordable, cognisant of cost being the major, overt rationale for HSR termination. There is limited scope for alternative major projects requiring large injections of Malaysian budget finance in the near-term. Could another landmark project fill the HSR void? Clean energy generation and exchange provides a good candidate, with scope for major private sector led investments conditional on unwinding sector monopolies. Singapore has a reliable energy supply but its electricity prices are around three times those in Malaysia. Its limited land mass constrains renewable energy generation, so some creativity and cooperation are required to meet its long-term carbon commitments. An agreement trialling investment in renewable imports was reportedly signed last month, with a modest aim of supplying 1.5 per cent of Singapore’s electricity. The deal is expected to tap into leading utilities provider TNB’s existing hydroelectric power supplies and generate new investment in solar farms. This is a promising start that could be scaled up to the benefit of both countries. Exports to Singapore could help kickstart substantial growth in Malaysia’s renewable energy generation and prompt a greater commitment to shifting its energy mix.   It would ideally encourage long promised reforms liberalising Malaysia’s power sector – still a state-run monopoly with heavily subsidised electricity prices – and reducing dependence on oil and gas (also dominated by government-linked Petronas), which represent major obstacles to a cleaner energy mix. KEEPING THE HSR DREAM ALIVE As beneficial as the above would be to deepening bilateral relations, nothing can be as singularly inspiring and transformative as the HSR. Without generating false hope, the door should be left open to resurrecting the project when circumstances improve. Three immediate actions to keep the dream alive would be to: Continue discussions to resolve differences around project structure; explore alternative financing arrangements less dependent on the Malaysian budget; and keep the compensation payment for the HSR. On the third point, Singapore reinvesting the compensation payment in scoping work or pledging to return it upon revival of the project would provide a powerful symbol of its commitment to bilateral cooperation on a future HSR. Like all lasting relationships, bilateral ties between Malaysia and Singapore ebb and flow as political and situational tides change. When conditions are good for swimming, both sides should make waves. The HSR dream may have faded but opportunities abound to strengthen connections.

          "context": "moving into phase 3 of re opening on 28 dec 2020\nAs Singapore has made good progress to support a further resumption of activities, the Multi-Ministry Taskforce (MTF) will start Phase 3 of re-opening from 28 Dec 2020. Update on pre-conditions for moving into Phase 3To move into Phase 3, we needed: a)Adherence to safe management measuresb)Sufficient testing capabilities for early detection and public health action: Singapore ramped up Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test capacity significantly to be able to run over 50,000 tests a day. Antigen rapid tests were also introduced for larger and higher-risk events. c)High adoption of TraceTogether (TT) for quick and effective contact tracing: As at 13 Dec 2020, around 65% of Singapore residents are on the TT Programme, and Singapore is on track to reaching the target of around 70% by the end-2020.\nFurther re-opening in the community Having assessed that these pre-conditions are in place, here is the list of activities that will be further re-opened in the community from 28 Dec 2020: Activities Details Group size for gatherings will be increased from 5 to 8 persons Up to 8 persons for social gatherings and household visitors at any point in time Capacity limits of premises will be increased Attractions can start applying to the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) to increase their operating capacity from 50% to up to 65% Capacity limits will be increase from 10m2 to 8m2 per person in malls and large standalone stores Capacity for congregational and other worship services will be increased up to 250 persons These services should be conducted in zones of 50 persons each for congregational services Congregational and other worship services as well as religious rites/prayers conducted at places of worship may involve live performance elements, e.g. with a limited number of singers, wind and other instruments, with the necessary safe management measures in place Total of 10 persons for marriage soleminsations + up to 8 visitors allowed In Phase 3, the hosting household will be able to invite up to 8 visitors (excluding members of hosting household, the solemniser and vendors), even if this exceeds the existing cap of 10 persons. In Phase 2, a total of 10 persons (including members of hosting household, excluding the solemniser and vendors) are allowed Live instrumental music (except for wind instruments) will be allowed for some activities Necessary safe management measures should be in place Activities include marriage solemnisations (in indoor venues only), funerals and funerary-related activities Changes in regulations for indoor live performances Indoor live performances can have up to 250 persons (in zones of up to 50 each) Pilots for up to 250 persons in live performances for outdoor venues (in zones of 50 each) The MTFwill continue to conduct pilots in some higher-risk activities and settingssuch as busking and live performances in outdoor venues, karaoke, nightlife toassess how these activities can take place and scale up safely.\nMandatory TraceTogether for SafeEntry check-ins will only be rolled-out in early 2021TraceTogether-only SafeEntry, where the TraceTogether App or Token is required for SafeEntry check-ins, will only be implemented early next year, after everyone who wants a Token has had a chance to collect one at a Community Club or Centre in their constituency.Until we implement TraceTogether-only SafeEntry, visitors can still perform SafeEntry check-in via the TraceTogether App, SingPass Mobile, or QR reader apps, or use their identity cards with barcodes such as NRIC, Pioneer or Merdeka Generation cards.Keeping Singapore’s migrant workers safeWith the stabilized situation at the migrant workers dormitories and Singapore’s transition into Phase 3, Singapore will gradually relax the restrictions on migrant workers to keep them both physically and mentally safe amidst the pandemic. Gradual relaxation of restrictions on migrant workers Can visit Recreational Centres more often to access daily needs e.g. barber or remittance services Migrant workers can access communal facilities in the dormitories e.g. cooking stations and sports facilities Pilot scheme will be started in the 1st quarter of 2021 to allow migrant workers to access the community once a month Subject to compliance with Rostered Routine Testing Wearing of contact tracing tokens Safe living measures Strengthen safe management measures for migrant workers Migrant workers living in dormitories and working in Construction, Marine Shipyard and Process (CMP) sectors must wear their BluePass tokens Employers to ensure workers continue to go for Rostered Routine Testing\nLooking ahead to further re-opening Even with the comprehensive plans for Phase 3, Singapore should continue to stay vigilant particularly with the upcoming festive period. Safe management measures, COVID-19 testing and contact tracing will continue to be necessary and effective in helping Singapore mitigate the virus spread and to keep the community transmission low. Strict checks and enforcement actions will continue to be carried out to ensure that Singapore is safe from the virus. Let’s all stay united and disciplined in our fight towards COVID-19 – for a safer and healthier 2021.For more details:",

It is false that there were 1,146 new cases. There was no instruction given by the Minister for Health or the Government to halve or under-report the number of cases. For the purpose of updating the number of new cases of COVID-19 per 24-hour period, MOH has always used 12pm as the cut-off time since the onset of COVID-19. There is no cover-up by the Government or MOH. MOH’s daily press releases publish information on all confirmed cases, including the number of imported cases, and the linked and unlinked cases at that point in time, even as contact tracing and epidemiological investigations are ongoing. MOH also publishes reports on the daily situation as well as an overview of the cases via the case summary table and dashboard which can be publicly accessed on MOH’s website. MOH does not act and has not acted in compliance with any of STR‘s posts.Additional ClarificationsContact tracing is a rigorous and time-intensive process, especially as case numbers increase. As there is significant public interest particularly in the number of new COVID-19 infections daily, MOH has started releasing top line numbers (i.e., the gross number of new cases which have been preliminarily confirmed) in the afternoon of each day, even as contact tracing and investigations continue. Subsequently, further updates and details of those cases are shared via the MOH press release issued later on the same night.We advise members of the public not to speculate and/or spread unfounded rumours.

          "context": "pm lee the covid 19 situation in singapore 14 dec\nMy fellow SingaporeansWe are coming to a full year since our first COVID-19 case.It has been a year of uncertainty, full of ups and downs, filled with anxiety and trepidation.But much has changed within the last few months. In March and April, we peaked at over 1,000 cases a day. Now, on most days we have zero cases of local transmissions. When the pandemic first started, we were worried if there would be enough supplies in the supermarkets. Today, supermarket shelves are full, and shopping is calm and uneventful. Parents were worried then whether their kids should go to school. But we kept the school year intact, CCAs have resumed, and graduating students have finished exams and are waiting for their results. We will not forget the two months of Circuit Breaker in April and May. But today, life is a lot more normal. We go to work, dine out, meet friends, though in groups no more than five.How did we bring things under control? It took a tremendous effort, and some good luck. Our measures were hard for everyone, but they worked. Singaporeans showed resilience and took them in their stride. Our economy took a big hit, but we did not let it crash. Despite the global economic dislocation, most of our workers kept their jobs.Now, our defences against COVID-19 are much stronger. We have steadily built up our testing capacities and procedures. We introduced Rostered Routine Testing of higher risk groups. We started using Antigen Rapid Tests, to resume larger gatherings and events safely. We also beefed up our contact tracing capabilities. For example, expanding our SafeEntry and TraceTogether programmes, and distributing TraceTogether tokens. We got used to the inconvenient restrictions and found ways to carry on with life. We looked after one another, reminding each other to adhere to safe distancing, to wear masks, to see a doctor if ill, and so on.I am very grateful that Singaporeans have complied with the spirit, and not just the letter of the rules. We stayed united, kept up our guard, and did not allow ourselves to become complacent over time. With everyone’s full support, our enhanced safeguards worked, and we could gradually ease our restrictions. We can be proud of how far we have come.Route to Phase 3Because of your efforts, we are now ready to progress to Phase 3. Phase 3 will begin in two weeks’ time, on 28 December, so we will end the year with some good news. The Ministerial Task Force will explain the details immediately after my broadcast. We will ease capacity limits in public places like malls and attractions, and at places of worship. One significant change is to allow groups of up to eight to congregate, up from the current maximum of five. So eight people can dine out together, or visit someone’s home. This will make it easier to hold family get-togethers during the festive period.Please understand that even as we enter Phase 3, the battle is far from won. The COVID-19 virus has not been eradicated. There is a long way to go. Around the world, the pandemic is still raging. Many countries are seeing second, third, or even fourth waves of infection, with record numbers of daily cases.International borders remain largely closed. But trade and travel are our lifeblood. The longer our borders stay closed to travellers, the greater the risk of us permanently losing out as an international hub, consequently hurting our livelihoods.Therefore, our only option is to re-open our borders in a controlled and safe manner. As we do so, we will see more imported cases. And there will be some risk of these cases spreading to the community. We already have had a few cases recently. An airport staff, who likely came into contact with infected passengers. A marine worker, who picked up the virus after boarding ships to do repair and resupply work. This is a calculated risk we have to accept. But the government will take every precaution and do our best to prevent imported cases from triggering a new outbreak.At the same time, Singaporeans must keep our guard up, because the virus is most likely still circulating silently within our community.\nThis is absolutely not the time to relax and let our guard down, or to hold a big party, imagining that the problem has disappeared. Progressing from Phase 2 to Phase 3 is a calibrated, careful move. We are easing the restrictions in a controlled way, so that we can keep the COVID-19 situation stable and take more steps forward later. It is vital that you stay cautious and vigilant, continue to cooperate with the government, and comply with the rules and restrictions that will apply in Phase 3.Update on VaccinationsHow long will we have to keep this up for? It may be for quite a while, possibly a year or more. One key factor is how soon COVID-19 vaccines become available to us.The government has been working quietly behind the scenes, since early in the pandemic, to secure access to vaccines. This was not a simple exercise. More than 200 vaccine candidates were being developed, and not all would succeed.We started talking to the pharmaceutical companies early to understand the science and identify the promising candidates and the vaccines likely to reach production sooner.We have set aside more than $1 billion. We placed multiple bets, to sign advance purchase agreements and make early down-payments for the most promising candidates, including with Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech, and Sinovac. We made arrangements with pharmaceutical companies to facilitate their clinical trials and drug development in Singapore and attracted a few to establish vaccine manufacturing capabilities here. We also supported local efforts to develop a vaccine. This gave our own scientists and researchers the opportunity to do cutting edge work. It was also insurance in case the global supply chain was disrupted. This way, we built up a diversified portfolio of options, to ensure that Singapore would be near the front of the queue for vaccines, and not last in line.Securing early access to vaccines was a whole-of-government effort. Many agencies and public officers, led by the Head of the Civil Service, were involved in this critical mission. I commend them for their good work. They are among the legion of unsung heroes who have helped us get through this crisis.As you would have read the news, the first vaccines are now coming into production. I am very happy to tell you that after studying the scientific evidence and clinical trial data, the Health Sciences Authority has approved the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for pandemic use. The first shipment should arrive by the end of this month, making Singapore one of the first countries to obtain this vaccine. We also expect other vaccines to arrive in Singapore in the coming months. If all goes according to plan, we will have enough vaccines for everyone in Singapore by 3Q2021.MOH has set up a committee of doctors and experts to recommend a vaccination strategy for us. The committee has proposed that the entire adult population should be vaccinated, but to make vaccinations voluntary. First priority will be given to those who are at greatest risk: healthcare workers and frontline personnel, as well as the elderly and vulnerable. Thereafter, the committee proposes to progressively vaccinate the rest of the population, and to cover everyone who wants a vaccination by the end of next year.The Government has accepted these recommendations. I have personal confidence in our experts. My colleagues and I, including the older ones, will be getting ourselves vaccinated early. This is to show you, especially seniors like me, that we believe the vaccines are safe.We have decided to make vaccinations free for all Singaporeans, and for all long-term residents who are currently here.\nWith more of us vaccinated, the harder it will be for the virus to spread, and the safer we will all be as a society.Vaccines will support our recovery in more ways than one. As a global aviation hub, we play a crucial role transporting vaccines around the world. Vaccines require cold chain management. An ordinary refrigerator is not good enough: the Pfizer vaccine needs to be stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius, colder than the Arctic in winter! This requires infrastructure, high standards, skilled personnel, and good connectivity to many different countries and all along the supply chain.Fortunately, Singapore has a strong ecosystem for cargo handling. Leading global logistics companies like DHL, UPS and FedEx are based here. SIA, and Changi Airport’s ground handling partners are certified by IATA (the International Air Transport Association) to handle and transport pharmaceutical supplies. We are now gearing ourselves up to handle large volumes of vaccine shipments into and through Singapore, to help win the global fight against COVID-19.We did not get here overnight. We have always planned ahead, systematically creating opportunities for ourselves. It took us years of investment and planning, building a business-friendly climate and expanding our air links around the world. These long-term investments are now paying dividends.ConclusionDuring this immediate crisis, we have reacted quickly and comprehensively, marshalled resources to solve our problems, and stayed resilient. Our situation is now stable, but only because everyone has worked so hard, and sacrificed so much. Now that vaccines are becoming available, we can see light at the end of the tunnel. As vaccinations become widespread not only in Singapore, but also in our region and the world, we can look forward to resuming more normal lives.Let us keep up our efforts in this final stretch, to cross the finish line together, and complete our mission to defeat COVID-19.Thank you.",

          "context": "pm lee responding to covid 19 and the other challenges ahead\nIn his speech at the debate on the Motion of Thanks to the President, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong spoke about how Singapore has dealt with the COVID-19 outbreak, how social safety nets can be improved amidst the challenges of COVID-19 and beyond, and how we can achieve a better balance in politics and build political consensus.He noted that Singapore had experienced several major crises since independence, and with each incident, Singapore came back stronger.\nHere’s a summary of his speech:1.Singapore’s response to COVID-19 We flattened the curve through:a.Contact tracing and testing capabilities b.Expansion of healthcare systemc.Mobilising SAF and Home Team to assist in testing and ensuring well-being of migrant workersd.Implementing circuit breaker in April 2020Singapore has done well in terms of health outcomes – low fatality rate, declining new infection rate, fewer than 100 patients in hospital.Singapore’s COVID-19 response was not without shortcomings, as the virus has severely tested every government in the world. Some things the government might have done differently:a.Discovering people with COVID-19 were infectious when asymptomaticb.Quarantine of all returning overseas Singaporeans, instead of only those returning from certain countries c.Testing all of them before releasing from quarantine, even when they don’t show symptoms d.Requiring the wearing of face masks soonerOverall, Singapore has been able to deal with COVID-19 only because the public service, the political leadership, our businesses, and the Singapore public have worked closely together, each doing their part. We must never let our guard down even as the current situation stabilises2.Social Safety Nets-To protect the vulnerable in our society and ensure that everyone has full access to opportunities to improve their lives-Extensive social safety nets were not needed in early decades of nationhood as Singapore was rapidly growing and the social infrastructure then was adequate for the pace of living-As our economy matures, we have progressively strengthened our social safety nets through introducing many schemes in these 15 years eg. ComCare, Workfare, Silver Support-These peacetime measures were insufficient during the COVID-19 outbreak – new emergency measures eg. Jobs Support Scheme, COVID-19 Support Grant were implemented -Identify pragmatic solutions to make best use of Singapore’s resources to meet the needs of different groups eg. older workers, low-wage workers, in a targeted manner -Ensure that government programmes should be kept fiscally sustainable 3.Foreign workers-Issue of competition between Singaporeans and foreigners for jobs has become sharper in this period of economic downturn-Many Singaporeans are feeling anxious and pressured about their jobs-With a small population, Singapore has to bring in foreign workers to grow the economy -Foreign worker policies are in place to grow the workforce in Singapore, rather than substituting the Singaporean worker-Employment Pass and S Pass numbers have come down since COVID-19 started -To ensure fair treatment in the workforce, there are different frameworks and organisations in place to do so eg. Tripartite Alliance for Fair & Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP), Fair Consideration Framework-Singapore still remains one of the few trusted countries that stand out – many companies have expressed interest in coming to Singapore to develop their business, which will create good new jobs for Singaporeans4.Politics-As our society evolves, there will be many difficult issues that we need to deal with -The government will lead this discussion with Singaporeans, build a political consensus around the right solutions, and move us forward-Attitudes and aspirations of Singaporeans change – desire more diversity, alternative voices, checks and balances-In the last General Election, many people voted for the opposition, while fully expecting that the PAP would remain in power as the government-Each new generation of PAP leaders has developed their own leadership styles and their own policy priorities-Tone of Parliament’s debate to shift with stronger opposition presence-At the most fundamental level, to make our politics work, both the government and opposition must share an overriding objective – to work for Singapore, not just for our party or our supporters",

          "context": "5 things to know about zika virus\nThe Ministry of Health (MOH) and National Environment Agency (NEA) have confirmed several cases of locally transmitted Zika virus infection, some of whom have recovered. They are not known to have travelled to Zika-affected areas recently and are thus likely to have been infected in Singapore.1. What is the Singapore Government doing about the locally transmitted cases?Screening and remaining alertMOH will continue to screen the close contacts of confirmed cases. All suspect cases will be isolated pending confirmation of the blood test results.All GPs, polyclinics and hospitals have been alerted and are to immediately report patients with symptoms associated with Zika virus infection to MOH. MOH and NEA will also alert residents in the vicinity to seek medical attention should they develop symptoms.IsolationFor now, as an added precaution, all suspect cases of Zika virus infection will be isolated while awaiting confirmation of the blood test results.PreventionNEA has intensified vector control operations to control the Aedes mosquito population. Vector control operations include: Inspecting all premises, ground and congregation areas Conducting mandatory treatment such as ultra-low volume misting of premises and thermal fogging of outdoor areas to kill adult mosquitoes Increasing frequency of drain flushing and oiling to prevent breeding Public education outreach and distribution of insect repellentsNEA will also be activating partner agencies of the Inter-Agency Dengue Task Force to step up localised search and destroy efforts in their respective areas.2. What is the Zika virus? Zika virus infection is transmitted by the bite of an infected Aedes mosquito. The Aedes mosquito is also a known carrier of the Dengue and Chikungunya viruses. Zika is generally a mild disease. It may cause a viral fever similar to dengue or chikungunya, with fever, skin rashes, body aches, and headache. Some infected with the Zika virus may not even develop symptoms.However, Zika virus infection may cause microcephaly in the unborn foetuses of pregnant women. Microcephaly is a rare neurological condition that manifests itself as birth defects in which a baby is born with significantly smaller heads.3. How do I know if I have Zika?The symptoms for Zika include: Mild fever Rashes Headaches Muscle pain Joint pains Conjunctivitis (a form of eye inflammation)Most people infected with the Zika virus do not develop symptoms. For those who do, the symptoms are often very mild. They usually develop within 3 to 12 days after the mosquito bite and often last between 4 to 7 days. If you have travelled to an affected country, or live in an area with a known Zika case, you should monitor your health and consult a doctor if you are unwell, especially if you have a fever and rash. We advise residents, especially pregnant women, in the Aljunied Crescent area to monitor their health. Seek medical attention if you are unwell, especially with symptoms such as fever and rash. Those without these symptoms but who are concerned that they have been infected with the Zika virus should consult and follow the advice of their doctors regarding the monitoring of their pregnancy. 4. Is there a cure for Zika? At the moment, there is no cure nor vaccine to prevent Zika infection. Treatment is solely focused on relieving the symptoms. Those infected are advised to get plenty of rest, drink enough fluids, and treat pain with common medicines.5. How can I play my part? Do the 5-step Mozzie Wipeout to prevent the Aedes mosquito from breeding at home. Cooperate with the NEA, and allow its officers to inspect your premises for mosquito breeding and to spray insecticide to kill any mosquitoes. Protect yourself from mosquito bites by applying insect repellent regularly.Sources: MOH – First Case of Locally Transmitted Zika Virus InfectionMOH – Zika VirusNEA - Precautionary Measures Against Zika Virus InfectionMOH – Additional Measures Against Zika VirusBy: Nur Hidayah Binte Mohd Roslan & Gov.sg team",

But there are conditions that we should all abide by, to ensure that we continue to stay safe. When planning for sporting activities like basketball games, booking a gym session and even indoor group workouts, keep the following Safe Management Measures in mind:1. Use SafeEntry, TraceTogether and take your temperature as you enterBefore entering sport facilities, make sure you’re well. If you’re sick , be socially responsible and stay home. Check-in with SafeEntry and use TraceTogether as these are tools to facilitate contact tracing in the event it’s needed.2. Masks should be worn as a defaultYou may remove your mask when engaging in strenuous exercises, but mask-wearing is still recommended as a good practice.3. Practice safe distancing and keep group activities smallA physical distance of 2m should be maintained between individuals playing sports. If you’re engaging in indoor high intensity or high movement exercise classes, keep 3m apart from others. If you’re participating in group sports and activities, it has to be limited to a maximum of 5 participants. This may include an additional instructor or a coach for organised programmes and classesFor groups sharing a space, don’t mingle between groups. The groups must keep 3m apart at all times.4. Contact sports are permittedContact sports with prolonged contact (like wrestling and jujitsu) can proceed if a group size limit of 5 is maintained at all times. Multiple groups can share the same space, but groups should keep 3m apart with no intermingling.5. Maintain personal hygieneAbove all, to protect yourself and others, maintain good personal hygiene.Avoid touching public objects and common touchpoints as much as possible, and use a towel to wipe your sweat (don’t touch your face with your hands!). Wash or sanitise your hands after your sport or activity.If you can, bring your own personal equipment. If this cannot be done, then wipe the equipment before and after use.For detailed information on Safe Management Measures at specific facilities, click here.

It said that there was no assurance that the review would result in any transaction, or that any definitive or binding agreement would be reached. \"SPH will, in compliance with applicable rules, make further announcements as appropriate,\" it said. The announcement came as SPH posted a 26 per cent growth in first-half net profit, helped by its non-media businesses. Net profit rose to S$97.9 million in the six months ended Feb 28, compared with S$77.6 million in the same period a year ago. \"Despite expanding our audience reach, our media business continues to be affected by the structural decline in advertising and the impact of COVID-19,\"said Mr Ng Yat Chung, chief executive officer of SPH. \"We will continue our digital transformation strategy and efforts to place media on a more sustainable footing.\" Advertising was affected across most sectors with the exception of government spending, the company said in a separate release. Circulation revenue decreased 4.7 per cent as daily average newspaper print sales fell by 16 per cent, or 70,831 copies. This was mitigated by a 20.2 per cent growth in digital circulation, with daily average newspaper digital sales of about 70,000 copies. SPH is organised into four major operating segments, namely media, retail and commercial, purpose-built student accommodation, and others. Overall, total revenue in the first half fell 4.2 per cent to S$460.3 million, on the back of a 23.9 per cent decline in revenuefrom the media segment. Revenue for its otherssegment,which includes aged care, digital and exhibitions,also fell by 16.9 per cent. Revenue for the purpose-built student accommodation segment rose 24.2 per cent, while its retail and commercial segment edged up 4.4 per cent. It receivedgrant income of S$15 million from the Jobs Support Scheme. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, SPH has trimmed its headcount over the past year, shaving off 4.6 per cent, or S$7.7 million, in staff costs during the reporting period. Headcount as of end-Feb was 3,540, compared with 3,968 during the same period in 2020 and 4,069 in 2019, it said. The board has declared an interim dividend rate of 3 cents per share.",

The cruise line's 11-month Singapore season, which resumed sailing last December, will mark the longest yet for one of Asia's largest cruise ships. Last year, Quantum of the Seas began offering Singapore residents \"cruises to nowhere\" under the CruiseSafe certification, developed by the Singapore Tourism Board (STB). \"Following a successful run and high marks from guests, Royal Caribbean first extended the season for three months, through June 2021, and is doing it again for an additional four months,\" said Royal Caribbean in a media release. President and chief executive officer of Royal Carribean International Michael Bayley said the company has continued to see an \"overwhelming demand\" in Singapore to sail on board the Quantum of the Seas. \"With more than 50,000 guests having cruised with us and zero positive COVID-19 cases to date, holidaymakers can rest assured we are focused on delivering safe, memorable cruise holidays,\" said Mr Bayley. Last December, an 83-year-old passenger on board a Quantum of the Seas cruise to nowhere tested positive for COVID-19, prompting the ship to returnto Singapore a day ahead of schedule. However, further tests confirmed that the man did not test positive for the virus. Quantum of the Seas will offer two-, three- and four-night cruises to Singapore residents. New cruise sailings will open for booking for Singapore residents on Apr 13. The company said the cruise line will continue to operate with the same set of health and safety measures in place, such as COVID-19 testing, reduced sailing capacity, physical distancing measures, enhanced cleaning and sanitising processes, as well as contact tracing. STB's director of cruise Annie Chang said Singapore's CruiseSafe standards have set a \"clear benchmark\" for its cruise partners, who have been diligent in ensuring the measures are adhered to. She added that more than 90 sailings with more than 120,000 passengers have been completed with no reported COVID-19 cases spreading on board.",

Seven cases are work permit holders who arrived from Bangladesh, India and Malaysia, of whom two are foreign domestic workers. Two cases are student's pass holders who arrived from India and the United States. The othercase reported today is a special pass holder who is a member of a sea crew. He arrived from Malaysia on a vessel and was tested on board without disembarking, MOH said. Epidemiological investigations are in progress. All the identified close contacts of the cases have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine periodso that MOHcan detect asymptomatic cases. MOH will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the cases could have been infected by them.  Seventeen more cases have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities, bringing Singapore's total recoveries to 60,202. There are 40cases still in hospital. Most of them are stable or improving, and one is in the intensive care unit. Another 206are being isolated and cared for at community facilities. The number of new COVID-19 cases in the community has remained stable at two cases per week in the past two weeks. The number of unlinked cases in the community has also remained stable at twocases per week in the past twoweeks, said MOH. Of the 178 confirmed COVID-19 cases reported between Mar 29 andApr 4, 63 cases have tested positive for their serology tests, 86 have tested negativeand 29 serology test results are pending. MORE EMPLOYEES MAY RETURN TO THE WORKPLACE FROM APR 5 From Monday, more employeesmay return to the workplaceand split team arrangements will no longer be mandatory as Singapore eases some COVID-19 measures. Co-chair of the COVID-19 multi-ministry task force Lawrence Wong announced last week that Singaporewill shift fromworking-from-home as a default mode to a more “flexible and hybrid way” of working. Up to 75 per cent of employees can now be at the workplace at any one time, up from the current 50 per cent. The current cap on the time an employee spends at the workplace will also be lifted. Companies are encouragedto stagger start times for employees and implement flexible working hours, said Mr Wong, adding that safe management measures must still be adhered to.
